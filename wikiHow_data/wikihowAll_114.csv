Become a better friend to both her and her friends.,
Joke around and tease one another.,
Try to flirt with her.,
Play hard to get.,
Consider keeping things casual.",How to Get a Girl to Like You when She Has No Interest in Relationships3," Friendships are the foundation of good relationships. The first step to being a good friend is paying attention to what her and her friends say.Avoid talking only about yourself and your interests. Give her your fill attention by not looking bored or distracted. Put your phone away and make eye-contact when you talk. While being a good friend can backfired and get you “friend zoned”, more often it is a way to show you are kind, caring, and committed., When done affectionately, light teasing is a subtle way to show you are interested.For example, make-up a funny story about travelling to a different country or pretend your house is haunted. Lightheartedly tease her about her taste in music, or a weird food she likes, and then follow it up with a compliment.Other examples of teasing include light tickling, placing your hands over someone eyes and saying “guess who”, or giving them a light shove or nudge on the back or arm.
Show you are teasing by using an exaggerated tone of voice, facial expressions, or a smile., When flirting, you want to start with something subtle, such as making eye contact, smiling, and then quickly looking away.You can also compliment her or act like an old-fashioned gentleman by holding doors, offering to buy her coffee, or carrying her books. If you know one another and are comfortable around each other, try brushing a strand of hair off her face, give her a hug, or sit next to her. If she is interested in you, she will start flirting back.

, One way to get a girl not to like you is to come off as too needy, clingy, or desperate. If your relationship has stalled, consider giving her some space. Start talking to other girls, and playing hard to get. By creating a challenge, you make yourself look more desirable.Hold back some of your feelings in the beginning of the relationship. Maintaining a sense of mystery and uncertainty helps keeps things interesting – and perhaps kindle romantic feelings.For example, don't tell her how much you like her and talk about your ""future"" together the first time you hang out.
Give her some space. While you do not want to stand her up if you’ve made plans, don’t text or call her every day. Your absence may lead her to realize how much she actually cares for you.

, If you like her and she likes you, but is afraid or nervous of commitment, you can always decide to maintain a casual relationship.Casual relationships are non-exclusive romantic relationships. While you might see each other on a semi-regular basis, you are open to flirt with or go out with others. Especially if you are between the ages of 18 to 24, having an open, casual relationship can help you grow emotionally and become more comfortable interacting with the opposite sex.In a casual relationship, it is important to establish ground rules to minimize the risk of someone getting hurt:Is it okay to go out in public?
Is it okay if others know, or should the relationship be kept secret?
What happens when one person becomes romantic with someone else? Will you tell each other if this happens?
How often do you want to see each other? When is it okay to call or text?
Do not ask questions that are condescending or accusing, such as: how many people are you seeing? Where were you last night? Why didn't you return my calls? Can I add you on Facebook?
If you cannot agree to these terms, than you probably should not pursue a casual relationship. Tell her your feelings and let her know you’re interested, but that you should remain friends if she feels she can't commit to something more serious.

Meet new girls.,
Find nerdy girls.,
Find reasons to hang out.,
Get to know her.,
Find things you have in common.,
Be a good friend.,
Don’t be a creeper.",How to Get a Girlfriend as a Nerd2," If you want a girlfriend, you’re going to have to know some girls first. And unless you are a master of asking girls out, you’re probably going to need to befriend them before asking them out. There aren’t very many people, never mind girls who’ve dealt with a lifetime of harassment, that want to date someone they don’t know at least a little. Meet girls at school, while out doing activities (like going to the gym) or even at social events.

, More than anything you’re going to want to try to find nerdy girls. This isn’t nearly so hard as it sounds. They do, in fact, exist! You can meet nerdy girls in many of the places you usually go: the comics shop, local conventions, video game tournaments, etc. Impress her with your Sonic Screwdriver collection and let her impress you with her serious pwnage in League of Legends.


Go online to have an even easier time meeting nerdy girls. We suggest Tumblr. That’s a safe bet.

, Once you’ve met some girls that you think might be nice, find reasons to hang out with them so you can get to know them better and so that they can get to know you. The more you hang out, the more comfortable you will be hanging out around this girl.


This is easy to do if they’re nerdy: start a DnD group, arrange a group to go to the arcade, or get a bunch of friends together to go to a midnight release.
If they’re not nerdy, you can still easily throw a party, go see movies, or do something accessible like playing board or card games (who doesn’t like Apples to Apples?).
Hang out in groups first. This will make both of you more comfortable, since you’ll be able to get to know each other and interact without feeling like you’re on a date.

, Getting to know her will be very important. This shows her that you care about her and her feelings. It will give you things to talk about and ways for you to connect. Of course, getting to know her is going to mean talking and a lot of listening. Ask her about religion, politics, what she likes to do for fun, her family, where she grew up....and don’t be critical or demeaning about her answers! Respect her opinion and ideas. She’ll like that.

, If she’s nerdy, explore your nerdery together to find fandoms and activities you have in common. If she’s not nerdy, find ways that you can introduce her to nerdy things she might enjoy. Don’t forget to also find enjoyment in the things that she likes, not just show her all the things that you enjoy. If she’s a girl worth dating, she’ll have good taste. Just trust her and let her be your guide on the road to new awesome things.


Minecraft or the Sims are easy ways to introduce girls to video games. She probably already likes Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Twilight (so introduce her to other good fantasy books or movies). Webcomics might be a good way to ease her into comic reading (try Questionable Content, Anders Loves Maria, or Dumbing of Age). And as far as getting her into sci fi or nerdy shows, start with Firefly. If that doesn’t work, Doctor Who.
Don't feel like you have to convert her to full nerd. If she can be converted to full nerd, she'll do that on her own. Introducing her to nerdy things is more about giving you some basic ground to meet on. But you really do need to meet her halfway and find enjoyment in the things that she likes too.

, You worry about friend-zoning. We know. And that might happen. But becoming friends with a girl, showing her what a wonderful person you are and how much happier she’d be if she was with a guy like you, is the best way to find a girlfriend that you can be happy with for a long time.


Be a good friend by being supportive when she's having a hard day, helping her take her mind off of her problems, being available to her if she needs help, and listening when she needs to talk. Care about her feelings as much as you care about your own.

, It’s cute when all Link can say in a conversation is “Hup Heh Yaahhh!” but it’s way less cute when you can’t get actual words out of your mouth. Speak! Talk to the girl. Don’t lurk in the corner, like some BBS newb. And definitely don’t spend all your time staring at her boobs. -100 XP, dude.


Also DON’T pull a Romeo and stalk her house, her Facebook, or any other “personal” space. That is not cool, will totally freak her out, and kill your chances with her.

Build your self esteem.,
Imagine the worst thing that could possibly happen.,
Put yourself in situations that make you uncomfortable.,
Don’t compare yourself to others.",How to Get a Girlfriend as a Nerd3," Build your self esteem and confidence if you really want to be less shy. With good self confidence and esteem, you will feel like you are a wonderful person who can have all of the awesome things you deserve. There are lots of ways to do this, from learning a new skill to volunteering for a good cause.


Self confidence and self esteem are also very attractive qualities. Girls will fall head over heels for a guy that is confident in himself and his abilities. Just keep saying to yourself: I am Han Solo. I will get my Princess. And I totally shot first.

, One trick to overcoming shyness is to imagine the worst thing that could possible happen and ask yourself: would it really be the end of the world. It feels horrible to do things that scare us or experience things that go wrong, but you won’t die. In a few years, you probably won’t even remember it. With this is mind, try to let go in situations where you’re shy and just enjoy yourself.


Be ridiculous when you imagine these situations. The absurdity of the situation will make you laugh and feel much better. Don’t want to go talk to that girl over there? What’s the worst that could happen? Well, she could be a vampire. Not the sexy, Kristen Stewart kind but the kind that needs to cut up your corpse and use your blood to open a portal to Hell so that she can release her demon brethren to feed on all mankind. Do you really think that could happen? No. There is no way that girl is that terrifying. You’ll be fine.

, As with so many things in life, practice is a great way to get good at anything. Practice being in social situations, like being around girls, and you’ll feel much more comfortable over time. Go places and do social things that make you feel uncomfortable, and with time you’ll learn that you get through the awkwardness and the discomfort and nothing bad happens to you.


Try to go to parties for example. And don't just be a fly on the wall! Get out and talk to people. To point is to practice and get comfortable spending time around girls.
You can also try the instant immersion method. Take a dance class or a yoga class. This will help you make female friends but it will also get you used to spending time with them very quickly. If any of your guy friends question your sexuality when you do this, point out that now you get to spend hours every week hanging out with girls in tight clothing.

, Sometimes we feel shy because we feel like the people around us are better than us. We think they look better or talk better or act cooler and we don’t walk to talk or bring attention to ourselves because then people will realize that we’re funny-looking or boring or weird. But you are not those people....and they are not you. You are unique and cool and only you can offer the world the amazing things you have to offer.


For example, that jock guy that seems to get all the girls? Yeah, he's got unpleasant things about him too. Girls will realize this. Especially the ones worth being with. They will see that maybe he's more social or more handsome, but they'll also see that you're smarter or more stable. So don't compare yourself to him because eventually girls are going to want what you have, not what he has.
Dude, you could be the next Steve Jobs. You don't know. Don't doubt yourself or try to change yourself. You could be denying everyone the next iPad by trying to be someone else. And that would suck.

Just ask.,
Ask in private, not it public.,
Have a date idea before you ask her out.,
Ask out a non-nerdy girl.,
Ask out a totally nerdy girl.,
Don’t sweat rejection.",How to Get a Girlfriend as a Nerd4," At the end of the day, the most important thing is to just ask a girl out. Don’t try to get around it or make it seem like something other than what it is. It’s terrifying and you’ll feel like you’re about to have a heart attack, but if you ask her straight and act confident, she’ll be much more likely to say yes.


Asking IRL, rather than through a text or email will earn you points. Unless your digital method is something really special and epic.

, Asking her out somewhere private rather than somewhere public will make both of you feel more comfortable. You won’t be so afraid of being rejected in public and she won’t feel pressured into saying yes (believe us, that’s a good thing...she should feel like she has a choice).

, Don’ ask her out and then have nothing to suggest. This is poor planning and will make you look a little silly. You don’t have to have some brilliant plan for a first date but at least have something basic, like “go to a movie” or “get dinner at this awesome place”.

, The key to asking out non-nerdy girls is to make them feel smart, worthwhile, and helpful. You don't want her to feel like you look down on her or only like her for her looks, as that is often what scares girls away from dating nerds. Don't rub it in their face if you are smarter (even if you are, pretend that you don't think or know that) and try to show her the ways that she makes you a better person.



Non-nerdy girl Example 1: ""So we've been hanging out a bit lately and I know we don't always understand each other, but I would really like to get to know you more. I know that band you like is going to be in town next month; why don't we get tickets and go see them?""

Non-nerdy girl Example 2: ""You know, I think you're really amazing. You're kind and smart and I really respect how hard you work to help others. I'd like the chance to see more of that side of you. What do you say? How about we drop by that animal shelter this weekend and see if they need a hand?""

Non-nerdy girl Example 3: ""You're incredible, you know. Most of the time, I think you're way smarter than me. I want to spend more time with you, get to talk more about the world and how you see things. What do you think? Would you be willing to head to the library with me this weekend? We've got that big test coming up and I could use a study-buddy.""

, This is a little easier, because believe us: she's already looking for a nerdy guy to date. Emphasize that you love having someone that understands you and that can keep up with you (or beat you). Come up with a date idea that you know she'll love and you're set.



Nerdy girl Example 1: ""You know, I really think you're amazing and fun and I'd love to get to spend more time getting to know you. That new Art of Video Games exhibit just opened at the museum and I would really like it if you went with me. Maybe we can get some dinner afterwards? My treat.""

Nerdy girl Example 2: ""I've been having a lot of fun hanging out lately and I wondered if maybe you'd like to hang out more, just the two of us. The comic shop is having a sale this weekend. Do you wanna comb through the bins with me and then grab some lunch?""

Nerdy girl Example 3: ""So, we've been hanging out for awhile now and I don't know about you but I think we've had some pretty great adventures. Maybe not through all of space and time, but that weekend at the con was pretty crazy. I'd like to have a few more adventures with you, if I can. So, what do you say: will you be my Companion?""

, Believe us, everybody gets rejected. It’s not just nerds. If she rejects you, don’t take it personally. It just means that she’s not the right girl for you. She wouldn’t have been able to appreciate all of the amazing things about you. This is not to say that she’s a bad person for not being interested but, just like guys, sometimes a girl just won’t feel that click. It doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with either of you.

Set yourself apart from the rest by keeping texts short and sweet.While texting is a great alternative to actually calling a person during a busy day, it shouldn’t be treated exactly like a phone call in the sense that messages should be short and sweet.

,
Add personality to the things you text.,
Avoid letting your excitement for flirting lead to over-texting.,
Spark attraction by creating tension.,
Move the relationship forward by talking in person.In order to move things to the next step, you have to create the next step.",How to Flirt over the Phone2,", Unless it’s a text to say “good morning”, skip the formality texts that offer no flirtation value or act as energy zappers, such as “Hey what’s up?” They are typically followed by a routine back and forth that eventually dies out really early on.Before you text him or her, make sure that you have something of value to add to the conversation, whether it be a joke or a genuine compliment. Think of creative ways to initiate text messages like mentioning a lyric to a song you both like or a movie that the two of you love. Create inside jokes to build and show interest.
Text an attention grabber like, “I’m thinking of you so I know you’re probably thinking of me.”It’s cocky, without being overly cocky and is bound to get its reader to crack a smile and respond in a hurried fashion.

, Over-texting is the pitfall to many budding romances. Hitting it off and establishing a connection can lead to needy behaviors, over-texting being one of them.Text him or her once, wait for a reply, and if you get one, reply with one text in response. Think of texting as a dance, you take a step, and then they take a step, you take a step, and then they take a step. If you don’t get a reply, wait a full 24 hours to attempt to reach out again.
As the relationship progresses, you will be able to slowly increase the frequency of your text messages. Too much at once though feels over-eager and can read as desperation. Appearing scarce by allowing time in between texts creates intrigue.

, Flirting through text messages is about the rapport that builds the connection and the tension that fosters the attraction between you two.Tension happens through playful teasing so keep it light and flirt with him or her while you text.


Give him or her a cute nickname, preferably one that has something to do with a shared experience between you two, “punk”, “brat”, “dimples”, “smiley”, or “giggles”. You can call them something common like “babe”, “baby”, or “sweetie”.Create some playful sexual tension by texting things like, “Stop trying to seduce me, I know what you’re up to” or “Get your mind out of the gutter!”, Don’t rely on the phone as a crutch and forget about building a relationship in real life. Once it feels right, ask him or her out on a date.

"
"
Forget about arbitrary rules on calling and interest.,
Come up with topics to talk about beforehand.,
Avoid distractions and focus on the conversation.",How to Flirt over the Phone3," While no one likes to appear too eager to talk to someone they like, there is a fine line between interested and disinterested. Contact the person when you feel like contacting them.You do not have to wait for the other person to make the first move in establishing contact.Maintaining balance between exchanges is important but who acts as the initiator is not. Ladies, if you want to call a guy that gave him your number, you don’t have to wait for him to call you first.
While gaps between conversations are perfectly fine, don’t allow more than a couple of days to pass without some form of contact happening.

, This will provide you with ammunition to flirt with him or her. But you should keep in mind that when you give a topic it mustn't be boring. Give a topic that both of you will enjoy and keep your attention.


Some light-hearted, fun questions to include on your topic list are: “Beer, wine, or liquor?”, “Favorite way to relax?”, “Superpowers you wished you had?”, and “What’s the weirdest thing about you?”Prepare yourself mentally to answer any questions that you ask. Conversations typically progress that way naturally., If you are going to talk on the phone with someone, don't watch TV, read a book, or hold another conversation in real life. It’s important that your attention is solely on the other person and that he or she can feel that while speaking to you.Find a quiet location to speak to him or her, avoiding heavily populated locations like a bus, shopping center, or a movie. You want the person to be able to hear you clearly and allow your tone to feel calm and collected as you flirt with your love interest.
Choose a time of day where you know the both of you will not be busy and be less prone to distraction. A good way to do this is to ask him or her ahead of time when an ideal time to call would be.

Consider the fact that you won't really know who you're flirting with.,
Realize that you won't really be able to 'hook up' with them; this is for fun flirting only!",How to Flirt on a Video Game With Online Players1," If there is no way to chat with the other person on the online/Wi-Fi game, then you have no way to know who they are. Even with a chatting online/Wi-Fi game, if you ask them about information, they may be uncomfortable with telling you and even report you if they can, they may lie, or they might just tell you what gender/age their avatar is (in games like Club Penguin, Animal Jam, etc). So, you don't really know if they are a really little kid, a creepy 40 or 60 year old man, or even if they are a girl or a boy. All these mean that you could end up flirting with a person who you don't really want to flirt with.;
, If you are trying to flirt with the other person to 'hook up' with them and get a boyfriend or girlfriend, then try a dating site like eHarmony or Match.com instead.

Be friends with her, if you see her regularly.,
Ask about her preferences.,
Learn what type of person she is interested in.,
Tell her about yourself.,
Make eye contact.,
Smile at her.,
Touch her arm or shoulder.,
Hold her hand.,
Hug her.,
Compliment her.,
Do her a favor.,
Let her know about your preferences.,
Let her know what your intentions are.,
Ask her out.",How to Flirt Girl to Girl," If possible, before you start any flirting with her, get to know her and become friendly with her. If she's a girl you like at school, begin by talking to her in class and saying hello in the halls. If that goes well, text her, call her, or ask her to hang out. If you don’t like her as a friend, then you probably shouldn’t be flirting with her.This is also a way to know what her romantic preferences are.;
, If you don't know what her preference is, then try to find out. You can begin flirting with her, but it may not end up well for you if you find out she is interested in another gender. Have a friend tell her that a girl likes her (no naming names of course) and see what her reaction is. If her reaction doesn't answer your question, then ask her yourself.To learn her preference on your own, you can first ask if you may ask her a personal question. Then, politely ask what her romantic preference is. If she doesn’t want to answer, don’t push the question.
Respect what she says and don’t push it no matter what her answer is.

, Keep in mind that just because she might be interested in girls, it doesn’t necessarily mean that she will be interested in you. Ask her about past relationships. You can also ask what she looks for in a romantic interest. Be observant about the type of person she seems to like and notice.You can ask what type of person she is interested in by asking if she likes qualities that describe you. For example, if you have red hair and brown eyes, ask if she’s interested in people with red hair and green eyes. Or, if you play soccer, ask if she’s interested in people that play soccer.
Don’t change yourself if you don’t appear to be the type of person she’s interested in. Just because you’re not her usual “type,” doesn’t mean she won’t be interested in who you are individually.

, Being open with the person you’re interested in is important. Let her know about your past, home life, and childhood. Tell her what your interests are and try to include her in some of them if possible. Talk to her on a daily basis about what you’re doing and how you’re feeling. Suggest that having her as a friend is one of the interesting parts of your life that you like.For example, take her to a movie with you if you are interested in film.

, Never underestimate the power of eye contact. Eye contact can be used to flirt. First, eye contact is simply a polite thing to do to show a person that you are paying attention to them. Letting her know that you are giving her your full attention will show your interest in her. If the girl is across the room, make eye contact with her. Look at her, catch her eye, and then quickly look away.Look the girl directly in the eye anytime she is talking, or even if she isn’t talking.

, Smiling is another polite gesture that can also be used to flirt. You don’t have to overdo it, but smiling at her will give her reassurance that you like her. Look her in the eyes and smile at her while you are conversing with her. If you happen to catch her eye while you are in the same room, give her a friendly smile., When you are talking or walking next to each other, touch her gently. You can touch her arm, back, or shoulder. Touch her just for a moment, or keep it there for a few seconds. Some people don’t like being touched, so if she expresses that she doesn’t like it, refrain from doing it., Hand holding is a sweet and simple gesture that never goes out of style. You can hold hands at any point in a relationship. If the flirtation is very new, wait until you are confident that she will enjoy holding hands with you. Take her hand when you are walking together. Hold her hand when you’re sitting next to her. If she wasn’t sure that you were flirting before, this will make it obvious., Move on to physical affection if she seems to be comfortable with the flirting or has stated that she likes you too. Give her a hug when you see her and when you say goodbye. Put your arm around her when you sit next to her. Comfort her with a hug when she’s upset, and hug her when something good has happened to her.Stop the physical contact if she seems uncomfortable or tells you that she doesn’t like it.

, Telling people what you like about them can go a long way. This often comes across as friendliness, but it will at least bring you closer to her. Compliment both her physical attributes and her personality traits. Tell her what you like about her hair, eyes, clothes, smile, etc. Let her know that you enjoy her sense of humor, interests, or how kind she is to everyone. When she does something good, let her know.Compliment an achievement by saying something like “I’m not surprised you did so well because you’re great, but I’m still impressed and happy for you.""
If she is a funny person, compliment her by saying “You really know how to make me laugh. I appreciate that quality in a person.”
The compliments may come across as friendly at first if you haven’t established your interest, but she may catch on after a while if you compliment her enough.

, Go out of your way to do her a favor, or surprise her by doing something unexpected for her. Oblige if she asks you to help her with something. Look for ways that you can make her life easier. For example, carry something for her when she is carrying a lot. Or, offer to run an errand for her. You can also surprise her with flowers, chocolates, or a small, but thoughtful gift.A small and thoughtful gift could be something like a drawing of yours, or a book by an author you think she’d like.

, Your romantic and sexual preferences will have to come up as some point, especially if you make your flirting obvious. Let her know that you are lesbian/bisexual/pansexual. You can bring it up in a casual conversation without telling her you’re interested in her. Or, you can let her know about your preferences and your interest at the same time.You can tell her your preference by saying something like “I am interested in women (or whatever your specific preference is), and I am especially interested in women like you.""
It is no fault of your own if she reacts negatively. It speaks of her character, and if she makes you feel bad about your preference, then she shouldn’t be a person you want to flirt with.

, You can wait until you have flirted with her to let her know that you’re interested in her if that’s what you feel more comfortable with. It is, however, good to tell her that you’re interested sooner rather than later to avoid heartbreak later on. She may be waiting for you to make the first move. Accept her reaction and try to continue the friendship if both you and her want to do so.Tell her simply by saying “I like you as more than a friend.”
Write her a note expressing your feelings.

, You can take this step fairly soon into the flirtation, or you can wait until you’re sure she likes you back. If you want it to be casual, ask her to visit the park with you. If you want to make it clearly romantic, ask her out for dinner and a movie. Bring flowers with you and don’t be afraid to tell her how you feel.Even when you are in a relationship, you can always continue to ask her out on dates.

Share things about yourself so that she sees you as a real person, rather than just a colleague.Let her know that you are taking improv classes on Wednesday nights or that you go mountain biking on the weekends.
Without making it obvious, hint to her that you're single, and therefore available.
Studies show that it's possible to create chemistry between two people.Try gently teasing her about her cute dimples.
Develop inside jokes. If you have a favorite show in common, try quoting it or sending her trailers for the upcoming season.;
, Few things garner the attention of a colleague more than professional success, so show her what an all-star you are at your job. By doing so, you’ll most likely receive praise by those who work alongside you, which is bound to get back to her. If you win awards or implement successful projects, she'll not only notice you, but will view you in a positive light.

This doesn’t mean showing too much skin, remember you should still be office-appropriate.
For women working in a casual office environment, instead of jeans wear a dress or skirt and put on some make-up so you'll stand out.
Men should consider a collared shirt rather than a t-shirt. Likewise nice slacks and a tie are sure to make her notice how put together you look.

, If you’re waiting for your crush to make the first move, looking lost in an excel document or constantly having your headphones on is a bad move. It’s beneficial to have a good rapport with co-workers, so show her how friendly you are with those around you, and she’ll be more likely to engage you in conversation.

, Say something casual but cute like, ""Hey, what's up?"" or, to be even more flirty, ""Wassup *winks*"". Use lots of smileys to be especially flirty and fun. The classic smile emote is great to use often, and the wink emote is great to use if you want to be really flirty. Also look for other flirty emote like the batting eyelashes emote and the blush emote. If you can't find these emotes, use *(the action you want here)* instead (for example, *blushes* or *bats eyelashes*).

, Here are a few ways to show you're interested in what she's saying/doing without upsetting your boyfriend/girlfriend:

Listen intently to what they say and never think about something else when you are with them.






Talk about things that you know they like. For example, if they love a certain book series or genre, (The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, fantasy book genre, etc.) then bring it up and talk about it with them. You could also give them a little gift, like a Mockingjay pin for a Hunger Games fan or a poster of their celebrity crush. However, only give them gifts if they are very good friends with you, or else they might find you creepy and/or your boyfriend/girlfriend will get upset.






Comment about changes in her look. For example, if it looks like their hairstyle has changed, then you could say, ""Hey, did you get a new haircut? It looks nice."" Not only does in show interest in them, but it also doubles as a compliment.







, Not too much, but just enough to keep the mood fun. For example, if they have a celebrity crush, tease them about their celeb crush a little by saying things like, ""Awww, isn't that cute? You have a crush on Harry Styles/Taylor Lautner/Justin Bieber etc."" or, ""The real question is.... what would Shawn Desman/Bruno Mars/Zac Efron have to say about that?"" To emphasize that you are joking, throw in a playful, flirty wink after telling your little joke.

, If you are a girl, go for a light, casual touch on the arm, hand, or shoulder without letting your touch linger or seem to dramatic and/or romantic. If you are too shy, then compliment them on their shirt or jacket (if they're wearing one) and touch the sleeve of the shirt just hard enough for them to feel you touch them. If you are a guy, be careful not to make her feel intimidated by you when you go for breaking the touch barrier as many girls feel uncomfortable if a guy touches them. If they are a close friend, hug her casually when you greet her or if she doesn't have your full attention when you approach her, then lightly tap her on the shoulder to get her attention but let your hand linger for a second or two.

, For instance, if your 'target' says, ""Hey, what are you doing today?"" say with a cute smile, ""Well, I was going to ask you if you wanted to hang out. Would you like to?"" However, don't make this seem like asking them out on a date or your partner will get upset. Also, only do this if you are good friends.

, If they're a girl, say that they are sweet or really friendly or tell them that they have a really pretty smile. If they are a boy, then compliment them if they (try to at least) impress you by saying something like, ""Wow! That was cool!"" or, ""Whoa! Did that really happen? That's so awesome/cool/amazing!"" You can also compliment them in a teasing way by telling them that they're cute. However, instead of saying if in a more meaningful way (which might upset your partner), say something (teasingly) like, ""Awwwww, aren't you cute?"" or, ""Awwwww, what you just did was so cute.""

Recognize the difference between flirting and sexual harassment.,
Examine how your coworker treats others.,
Determine what you need to feel comfortable.,
Address your coworker as soon as it happens.,
Be more direct with a persistent flirter.",How to Cope With a Flirtatious Co Worker1," Does your coworker make comments about how you look or dress? Find ways to touch you? Wink at you or make extended eye contact? Make suggestive jokes or comments?Identifying the behavior will help you create a plan of action.


Once you identify the specific behavior, think about how you feel when this happens. Do you feel uncomfortable or nervous?
Do you think your coworker is intentionally trying to make you feel uncomfortable or is unaware of their actions? Your coworker may not even realize that they are being flirty and making you uncomfortable.It may help to write down the flirtatious behavior.;

If you are a victim of sexual harassment, immediately report your coworker in accordance with the policies at your workplace. Human Resources is always a good place to start.

Even if this flirtatious behavior appears to be normal for your coworker, still speak up if you are feeling uncomfortable.

When a coworker flirts and you do not say anything, your coworker thinks this behavior is perfectly fine. It is also easier to correct a situation as soon it happens instead of trying to start a random conversation.For example, if your coworker comments about how great you look that day, say ""I feel uncomfortable when you comment about how I look. Could you keep those thoughts to yourself from now on?"" or ""Thanks for the compliment, but it really makes me uncomfortable when you say things like that.""If your coworker makes physical contact with you, say ""Hey, could you keep your hands to yourself. It makes me uncomfortable,"" or ""Not to be rude, but I need a little more personal space.""

If your coworker is receptive, thank them for being understanding and let them know that you want to continue to have a good professional relationship. There is no need to bring up the situation again.

, Your coworker will typically stop flirting with you once you speak up. However, if it does not happen, you can address the coworker one more time and/or speak to your supervisor or someone in human resources. This is not an issue that you have to deal with at your workplace.To be more direct, say, ""Hey ____. I told you that I do not like when you ___, and it needs to stop. You make me very uncomfortable, and I don't want to feel this way at work.""

They will probably say yes. If they don't, then they probably aren't really interested in talking with you right now and were just doing so before because they didn't want to seem rude. In this case say, ""Okay that's fine. See you later!"" if you asked them to be buddies beforehand, or say, ""Anyway, I'm going to go play a game/buy some stuff/go back to my igloo/house/den now.

Show off your angelic and devilish sides.,
Exercise your wit.",How to Enchant a Man," Dab a little perfume or cologne on before you meet him. Keep in mind that a little will go a long way; dousing yourself in perfume is more overwhelming than alluring.


Engage in a long-term enchantment by sticking with the same basic scent. The man in question will naturally associate that scent with you, and when he smells it—even if you're not there—his thoughts are more likely to turn in your direction.;
, High heels make your legs look skinnier and longer, increasing their visual appeal.Aside from creating a flattering leg line, high heels also change the way you walk. You'll generally take more deliberate, slower steps. Slow movements are more sensual, so they tend to be more enchanting, too.
Make sure that the heels you wear are comfortable and easy to walk in, of course.

, A short to mid-length skirt that shows off a bit of leg can pack a powerful punch. Moderation is key, though. The idea is to tease his imagination, not to reveal all of your physical assets off at once.

Your legs can be one of the easiest yet most powerful assets to show off. You can be provocative by wearing a mini skirt or a skirt with a long slit, or modest by wearing a knee-length skirt that hugs your hips in just the right way. Both options can be equally enchanting if you have the confidence to pull them off.






If you don't want to show off your legs, you can show your bare back or a bit of cleavage. Try to stick with one area at a time, though. If you want to wear a dress with a low back, for example, the neckline should be fairly modest and the hemline should be knee-length or longer.







, You need to feel confident in the clothes you slip on, so pick an outfit you feel great in. Clothing styles that hug your curves in all the right places can boost your self-image while increasing your perceived physical charm to the guy in question.


Understand that certain silhouettes flatter different body types. Learn to identify your body type, then dress to your specific body type. As a general rule, detail and perceived lines can be used to draw the eye to a certain area, while dark, solid colors can be used to direct the eye away.

, While it is not a strict rule, the general consensus is that black clothes and red clothes are more alluring to men than other colors are.


There's a reason why so many women have a little black dress in their wardrobe. Black is slimming and tends to give off a mysterious aura.
Psychologically, the color red is connected to love and lust. If a bright red is too bold for your tastes, you can try a deep shade of red or a deep shade of pink, instead.

, Wearing a little color on your lips will highlight them, thereby encouraging your man to take notice. Since the lips are a very sensual part of the body, making a man interested in yours can increase your physical charm.


Take some time to find a color that suits your skin tone and hair color. Your personality can also come into play. Bold colors can be very bewitching, but if your style tends to be more classic, subdued hues might work better.
Play around with different textures, too. Try both shimmery glosses and matte lipsticks.

, Even though a man may not consciously notice your manicure, well-groomed nails can make your hands look more sensual and feminine.


If nail polish isn't your thing, you should at least keep your nails trimmed and neat. Moisturize your hands on a regular basis to keep the skin soft and smooth, too.
As a general rule, short nails look better in clear and nude colors while long nails can be painted in deeper shades. Solid colors are more sophisticated than glitter polishes, so if you want to emphasize your womanly charms, solids are the way to go.

, You don't need to have the body of a supermodel, but it'll be easier for you to enchant a man if you are at least moderately fit. Good hygiene is also essential.


If you're fit enough to be healthy, you're more than fit enough to be enchanting. The basic idea is simply to show that you care enough about yourself to take care of your body. Demonstrating this basic level of self-respect can give you greater appeal.

, Meet his eyes before you even say “hello,” then maintain eye contact throughout your entire conversation.


Eye contact lets a man know that you're interested in him. Catching his glance before the conversation starts can give him the motivation he needs to approach you. Holding his glance during the conversation lets him know that he has your complete, undivided attention. If he has any reason to think that you're not interested in him, his interest in you may wane, too.

, Few things are as inviting and encouraging as a smile. Depending on the rest of your body language, you can shift a friendly smile to a captivating one.


When you're still in the process of getting something started, try smiling coyly whenever your eyes happen to meet his from across the room. This can have an even greater impact if you go out of your way to look over your shoulder, meet his eyes, and give him a smile.
When you're talking with him, you need to smile and laugh appropriately. Unless he's talking about something serious, a smile should be your default expression for the evening.

, Casually brush your hair behind your ears or run your fingers through it. Pass your hands over your neck and shoulders—the skin just beneath your hair—as well.


The trick is to keep your movements slow, gentle, and sultry. If you move too fast, he may not have enough time to take notice. If you move with too much force, you'll end up displaying aggression instead of sensuality.

, Look him over and let him know that you like what you see. Simply knowing that you find him attractive can make you seem more attractive in turn.


Make sure that he sees you looking him over from head to toe. Catch his eye and smile to let him know that you approve.
You can also come right out and compliment him directly. If you like his smile, tell him that you like his smile. If you love his eyes, tell him that you love his eyes.

, Your overall body language does not need to be provocative, but it should be open and inviting. If you act distant and uninterested, you might push him away instead of drawing him nearer.


Try arching your back and crossing your legs. Accentuate the gesture by lightly touching your own thigh. All of these movement can seem natural if done correctly, but they highlight your feminine charms and make you seem more enchanting.

, Close the distance between the two of you. Unless he can hear you when you speak at a low, whisper-like volume, you're not as close as you could be.


In fact, leaning in momentarily to actually whisper something in his ear is recommended. After the words are spoken, you'll need to pull back a bit, but you should still remain fairly close.

, Constant touch isn't necessarily recommended, but making brief, seemingly innocent contact now and then can tease and tempt him into wanting more.


If you're flirting with someone new, keep the touching to a minimum. Brush his arm as you speak or lean in against his shoulder. Keep the touches brief and light.
If you're trying to enchant a man you've been with for a while, your touches can be a little bolder. For instance, you could run your hand over the lapel of his suit while maintaining eye contact.

, In essence, he should see that you want him without feeling as though you need him. Show him that you're comfortable with who you are and capable of taking care of yourself.


Avoid apologizing for every little thing or acting notably nervous and uncomfortable. You may not be the most outgoing person ever, but as long as you seem comfortable with who you are, your confidence can show through.
While it isn't strictly necessary, it also helps if you can support yourself. A man with a stable lifestyle probably seems more enticing to you; similarly, a woman with a stable lifestyle usually seems more enticing to a man.

, It should be obvious to him that you want him around, but at the same time, you also need to let him have some personal space and time away from you.


Let him spend time with his buddies without pressuring him to invite you along.
If he's in a bad mood, let him know that you're more than willing to listen and help, but don't force him to talk about his feelings at that exact moment. Give him some space to cool down on his own.

, You don't need to have a bubbly personality, but you should let him see you as someone who loves life. Doing so will allow him to perceive you as someone who is pleasant to be around, thereby making him want to be around you even more.


Gravitate toward positive topics of conversation, like a pleasant memory or funny story about the day's events.
See the humor in things and laugh off the little annoyances. Instead of getting seriously angry about the way your frustrating co-worker treated you, convey the story humorously and brush it off as ""no big deal"" at the end.Laugh a lot when you're with him. Try new things and show him that you like to have fun.
If your personality is naturally serious, you can show him that you love life by simply approaching the things you enjoy with passion and zeal.

, Let him know that you really care about him by listening to him and taking an active interest in the happenings of his life.


People feel flattered and cared about when someone takes an interest in them. A guy is also more likely to reciprocate that interest when you demonstrate it first.
If you're getting to know a new man, ask him about his family, his job, his hobbies, his dreams, and his life in general.
When you're trying to enchant a man you've known for a long time, demonstrate your continued interest by asking him about his day and his present state of mind.
Make sure that you honestly listen to him, too. If you aren't paying attention, it'll probably be easy for him to notice.

, Turning yourself into a mystery can pique a man's interest, but each time you flaunt your mysterious side, you need to give him a puzzle he can solve.


It's much easier to seem mysterious when you're getting to know someone new. Be open with him on most fronts, but hint around about the fact that you still have a few secrets. When he finally does learn the truth behind those secrets, your appeal will increase even more.
When you're trying to enchant a guy you've been around for a long time, appearing mysterious can be much more difficult. Try showing him a side of your personality that you rarely act on. For instance, if you're usually a homebody, surprise him by dragging him out to a karaoke bar and putting on a little performance when it's your turn to sing. The contrast between what he sees now and what he has come to expect will suggest to him that there are still new things to learn about you.
If you want to keep a man enchanted throughout a long relationship, you'll need to exercise transparency, as well. Share your secrets with him once you know he can be trusted with them. Be vulnerable from time to time. Stop trying to hide your flaws and mistakes. Let your guard down so that he can sense just how much you trust him.

, At first glance, an enchantress may appear to have a devilish personality, but alternating between that side of your personality and the sweet, angelic side can make a bigger impact than sticking with one or the other might.


Your devilish side is a good asset to make use of when you want to create an enchanting moment. Display it by following most of the advice offered in this article concerning appearance and body language. The idea is to tempt him into wanting you.
Your angelic side is important when you want to increase your overall long-term charm. Demonstrate angelic behavior by being compassionate and considerate. Support him when he struggles and be sweet to him in general.

, If you really want to keep a man enchanted for a long time, you need to engage his mind. You won't be able to do that if you're constantly playing dumb.


Keep yourself updated on more than just the latest celebrity gossip. Pay attention to the world around you and build informed opinions. Even if they don't match his, being able to hold your own in conversation can still be an enchanting trait."

Make eye contact.,
Start a lip pout and bite soon after you make eye contact.,
Lower your eyelashes seductively.,
Do a triangle gaze.,
Bring your lower lip in very slightly.,
Lick your lower lips.,
Brush your teeth.,
Mix a homemade lip scrub to slough off any dead skin cells.,
Apply a layer of lip balm.,
Use a plumping or long lasting lipstick, if you want color.",How to Bite Your Lip Seductively," To let someone know you're interested in him, start by making eye contact. Move your eyes to his, hold briefly, then look away. Repeat this a few times,so that he knows you're intentionally looking at him.Don't stare at him. Staring is when you maintain fixed eye contact with someone for longer than a few seconds. Staring can seem aggressive or angry.
Pair your eye contact with a slight smile.
Make sure to watch his response. If he doesn't return your gaze, this is a sign he's not interested. If he looks back, smiles at you, or otherwise responds positively, that's a sign he's okay with your flirting.;
, Lower your bottom lip slightly so your teeth are barely showing. You don’t need to purse your lips, just open your mouth to entice the viewer. The pout is the first stage of the seductive lip bite.Studies show that women initiate flirting 90% of the time. Men flirt largely in response to feeling that flirtation has been initiated by women.A Manchester University study found that men spend the first 7 to 10 seconds of contact looking at women’s lips before moving onto other areas. Once you've confirmed that he's interested, initiate the lip pout.Remember that not all cultures share the same body flirtation signals.
Maintain eye contact while you pout your lips.

, After establishing eye contact, lowering your eyelids, or glancing at the object of your flirtation through your eyelashes, is a nonverbal indication of desire. You may want to lower your chin and look up at the person to strike a seductive pose.Some people find themselves naturally blinking their eyes more rapidly. This is also called ""batting"" the eyes. If this comes naturally to you, it can be another way to add your eyes to the flirtation. If it doesn't come naturally, it might seem like you have something stuck in your eye, and is best avoided.
The downward tilt of the chin is said to make women look more ""feminine"" and flirtatious. Men, on the other hand, are said to look more ""masculine"" when they tilt their chin up and gaze slightly down their nose., Look at one eye, and then move to the other eye and down to the lips. This will draw his attention to your lips.The reason your eye gaze will draw his attention to your lips is through the tendency of one person to mirror, or imitate, another when engaged in flirtation.
Directing your eye gaze to a man's lips is an overtly flirtatious gesture. It's a nonverbal way of indicating sexual interest.

, Bite tenderly on 1 side of the inner lip for 2 to 5 seconds, before slowly releasing. Maintain eye contact throughout. With eye contact, there's less chance that your lip bite could be misunderstood.Make sure your teeth don't bite your outer lip, as this may appear insecure or nervous.
A seductive bite should be gentle, never hurtful. It should not leave a mark.

, Following your lip bite, you may want to add a slight lick of your lower lip with your tongue. Your tongue is a sexual body part, and using your tongue now will make your flirtatious overture more seductive.Don't overdo it with lip-licking. This can result in chapped lips, which is the opposite effect you are trying to achieve.
Continue to make seductive eye contact throughout your encounter. The seductive lip bite is one gesture in the choreography of your flirtation, working together with others.

, Do this before you put on lipstick or lip gloss. If you need to floss to make sure that you don't have anything stuck between your teeth, do it. The quickest way to ruin a seductive lip bite is to have a piece of food stuck between your teeth.If you don’t have time to brush, use some mouthwash or chew a stick of gum for a few minutes.
Your breath should be fresh and clean.

, Stir together 1 tbsp. of sugar, 1 tbsp. of honey, 1/2 tsp. of petroleum jelly and 1/2 tsp. of olive oil. Spread a dime-sized amount of the scrub around your lips in a circular motion.Scrub until some of the sugar has dissolved. Rinse with warm water.
Apply twice a week for best results. The scrub will store in an airtight container for a week.

, Every time you wash your face, replenish your lips' moisture with some lip balm. Use a moisturizing product beneath your lipstick, but be careful to avoid lip balms that have drying chemicals in them.The best lip balms are made without a lot of chemicals. Look for lip balms that include ingredients like beeswax, shea butter, olive oil and cocoa butter.
Find a lip balm that works best for your lips.
Avoid using flavored lip balm when flirting, in case the scent of bubble gum or cherry isn't appealing to him.

, Red lipstick makes your teeth look whiter and your lips more noticeable. Wearing red lipstick may result in more male attention to your lips than pink lipstick. It doesn't have to be bright or thick lipstick, but research suggests that men are more likely to hold their gaze for longer on red lips than on pink ones.Make sure the lipstick or lip balm you choose does not come off of the lips easily. If it is too wet or sticky, it may come off onto your teeth when you bite your lip.
If you are male or don’t wear lipstick, use a moisturizing lip balm before you go out for the day.

Smile often.",How to Be Sweet," Part of being sweet means that you are thoughtful towards other people. You can achieve this by showing interest in other people's lives, or by doing nice things for them. For example:


Instead of talking about yourself, you can ask your friend about his day. This will show your friend that you are interested in his well-being. If your friend reveals that he is having a bad day, you can show how sweet you are by buying him some ice cream.
It is your friend's birthday. Unfortunately, it falls right during Finals week and ends up being forgotten by everyone else as they scramble to complete assignments and catch up on last-minute studying. You can surprise your friend by bringing her a cupcake or a balloon to school.;
, Part of being sweet is also being caring, which can be achieved through showing concern for other people. For example, if you notice someone looking upset, ask him or her what is wrong and if there is something you can do to help. This will show him or her that you care, even if he or she does not want any help.

, Part of being sweet means that you are polite and have good manners, even towards those you dislike. This means that you say things like ""please,"" and ""thank you,"" and ""excuse me"" or ""pardon me."" For example:


If someone compliments you, smile and say ""thank you!""
If you are eating in a cafeteria, and the salt shaker is too far away, do not reach across someone's face to grab it. Instead, ask: ""Could you pass the salt, please?""
If you are in a hurry and need to get through a crowd quickly, try not to shove your way through. Instead, say ""pardon me"" or excuse me"" and try to weave your way past people instead.

, This does not mean that you have to donate all your clothes to charity and give in to everyone's demands. You want to be generous to a certain extent, but not so much that people begin to take advantage of you. For example:


Your friend forgot to bring her lunch to school, and she has no money to buy something from the cafeteria. You can offer part of your lunch to your friend, or lend her some money so that she can buy something to eat from the cafeteria.
If the boy sitting next to you forgot to bring a pen or pencil to class, offer him one of yours.
If you suspect someone taking advantage of your generosity, it is okay to confront him or her about it, so long as you do it in a gentle, non-accusatory manner. For example, if your friend asks you for lunch money every day, you can try saying: ""Alright, I will help you one last time, but I really cannot afford helping you every day. What about bringing your own lunch from home tomorrow?""

, Not only will complimenting others help boost their self-esteem and make them feel better, but it will also make you appear kind and sweet. For example:


If your friend got a new haircut, tell her how cute it looks. She may be feeling self-conscious or uncertain about the change. Your compliment might just give her that much-needed boost of confidence.
The boy sitting next to you in class draws almost the time. Instead of just telling him that he draws really well, mention a particular detail, such as hair or eyes. You could say something like: ""Wow, you are really good at drawing! I really like how you did the eyes!""
Do not be over-generous with the compliments however; you might come off as creepy, annoying, or fake. You want your compliments to be genuine (or at least appear that way).

, Sweet people are the ones who are the first to offer help, even if it is not wanted. There are many ways you can help others, and some of those ways are small and almost effortless, such as opening doors. You can show your sweetness by offering help in many situations, such as:


A girl has just dropped all of her books. Instead of walking past or laughing at (which a sweet person would never do), go over to her and help her pick the books up.
A boy is helping set up for the school charity and has taken on more than he can can handle—literally. He is carrying way too much, and all of the boxes are falling out of his arms. Go over to him and offer to help him carry some of the boxes.
An elderly man in a wheelchair is about to leave a cafe, but the door is closed. You can show just how sweet you are by holding the door open for him. Don't forget to smile, and say ""You're welcome!"" if he thanks you.

, Sweetness is associated with softness and gentleness, so try to use a softer voice when speaking. This does not mean you must talk at a whisper or use a high-pitched voice. Just soften your voice to a low and gentle level. This will help you sound kinder.

, Part of being sweet involves developing good manners, which in turn, involves avoiding bad ones, such as swearing. If you get angry or upset (or stub your toe) bite your tongue and try not to swear or curse.


If you really must swear, stay away from any expletives, and say things such as ""drat"" or ""darn"" instead.

, Sweet people are nice people, and nice people generally like everyone—or at least act as though they like everyone. Try to refrain from insulting others or gossiping about them, and never bully anyone. Not only is this negative behavior, but it will show others that you are capable of thinking not-so-nice things about others. This, in turn, may cause those listening to you to wonder what you might think of them.""

, Instead, either ignore the bully or pretend that you did not hear the insulting or swearing. Bullies want attention, and you will be giving them just that by reacting to them.

, Part of being sweet and kind is being approachable. You can achieve this through maintaining proper posture—this means that your back is straight, your head is held high, and your shoulders are thrown back slightly (but not to the extent of discomfort). Slouching, crossing your arms, and sticking your hands in your pockets will make you appear disinterested, anti-social, or upset, none of which are considered very sweet.

, Not only are drugs harmful to your body, but vandalism can get you in trouble with authority. Sweet people are well-behaved people, and thus tend not to get into trouble. Refrain from vandalizing and destroying property (be it private or public), and try not to do drugs. Some drugs, such as hallucinogens, can lead you to partake in destructive behavior,while other drugs can deteriorate or permanently damage your health., Anyone can be sweet, regardless of how they look or what they wear, but certain styles and images tend to be associated with specific personality types.The change can be as simple as a gentle smile to as complex as a complete makeover, including a new hairstyle, new makeup, and a new outfit.

, Sweetness is associated with youthfulness, so refrain from wearing anything too revealing or ""sexy."" Opt instead for simple or modest outfits.


If you are a girl, consider wearing: a shirt with a sweetheart neckline and a knee-length skirt, a peasant blouse and some jeans, or a summery dress. Refrain from wearing anything that reveals too much cleavage or exposes your belly button. You can still look feminine, but be sure your outfit is also modest.
If you are a boy, consider wearing: slacks and button up shirts, neutral colors, or a simple T-shirt and jeans. Refrain from wearing anything with inappropriate designs or slogans, muscle shirts, or several sizes too large. You want a proper and modest image.

, Anyone can be sweet, regardless of how they dress, but certain shapes are associated with harshness. Wearing lots of spikes and studs might make you appear tough and intimidating, which in turn might make you appear unapproachable. Sweet people generally have a softer appearance, and are easy to approach.

, Light colors, such as pastels, pink, lilac, baby blue, and whites, are often associated with softness, purity, innocence and gentleness.Wearing these colors might help others perceive you as having these qualities.

, Sweetness is associated with youthfulness, which can be achieved through wearing little to no makeup. Consider wearing light eyeshadow, some mascara, and light-colored lipstick or lip gloss. You want your makeup to look simple and innocent, so stay away from dark or glamorous styles, such as smoky eyeshadow and dark red lipstick.


Consider wearing makeup that make your eyes appear larger, to lend that doe-eyed look often associated with youthfulness and innocence.

, Sweet people are often youthful, and youth is associated with good health. You can appear more healthy by taking good care of yourself. This means bathing every day, washing your face and brushing your teeth daily, and combing your hair. If you sweat or have a strong body odor, you may want to consider a deodorant.

, Staying neat will show others that you take care of yourself, which in turn gives others a more positive impression of you. You can make yourself appear tidy and neat by taking care of yourself and your clothes and belongings. This means you comb your hair, mend any rips or tears on your clothes, and wash your clothes if they get dirty. It also means that you take care of your belongings by keeping them clean and not letting them get ruined. For example:


You can protect your textbooks by covering them with paper, and storing them carefully so that the corners do not get bent.
You can keep your pencils looking neat by not chewing on them, and by sharpening them if they get dull.

, A smile will not only help you appear kinder, but it will also make you appear happier and thus more approachable.

Learn from this experience.",How to Deal With a Girl That Leads You On (for Guys)," It may be hard to determine if she's actually flirting with you or just being nice. It's easy to misinterpret girls' friendliness for romantic interest.Some ways you can tell if she’s flirting include:She leans toward you, smiles, and touches your arm while you’re talking.
She often compliments you, especially how you look.
She talks about being able single or wanting to date in front of you.
She often tries to spend time with you one-on-one.
She plays with her hair or tries to get you to notice her.;
, A girl may be flirting with you, but her words are more important than her actions. Keep in mind this could be difficult or confusing because girls tend to try to be too nice and indirect when they’re not interested.If she mentions a boyfriend or that she’s not interested in dating, she’s likely not interested in you in that way, even if her body language is flirtatious.

, There are many signs a girl can give that she’s not that interested in you. She may send mixed signals intentionally or unintentionally because she enjoys your company, but in reality she’s likely just keeping you around out of convenience. You might notice that she:Is vague in making plans with you, or calls or texts you at the last minute.
Never reaches out to make plans with you first.
Does not share a lot about herself with you.
Takes a long time to get back to your texts.
Talks about her ex-boyfriend a lot in front of you.
Only spends time with you when you pay for things, like nice dinners or going to the movies.

, Before you talk to her, talk to your friends or people you trust to get a fresh perspective. Chances are, you’re probably over-thinking your relationship with her, reading into every little thing she does or doesn’t do, and using a lot of energy thinking about her. Consulting with friends will help you get a more clear idea of what her behavior looks like from others., Confront her about her flirtatious or leading-on behavior. If you’re interested in her, you need to know if she likes you or not. You may be scared to talk to her for fear of being rejected, but you’ll never know how she really feels or what she really means by her flirting until you directly ask.If you talk over text, online, through a phone call, it may be less awkward or uncomfortable. Sometimes it’s harder to be clear about how you feel over text, so keep your language clear, simple, and direct. You can say, “I am attracted to you and I thought you might be too, because you wanted me to take you to the movies, complimented me a lot, and said you wanted to hang out with me more. I feel confused lately though. Are you interested in dating or not?”
If you meet in person, you’ll have an easier time reading her face and body language. Talking in-person will sometimes give you a more honest reaction.However, sometimes girls try to be too nice and indirect when they’re not interested. Keep in mind you may not even be able to get her to meet you in person if she’s being flaky or not responding to you.Still, be clear and direct. You can say, “I want to date you, how do you feel about that?”

, Once you’ve made your feelings clear, it's important to listen to and respect her feelings. Be patient and don’t expect an immediate answer from her. Be sensitive, but be clear that you want her to stop leading you on and to date her exclusively. Don't argue with her if she needs time to think it over.You can say, ""I want to be with you, and I hope you feel the same, but I know you might need some time to think about it. How about we get back together next week to see how you feel?""
If she seems ambivalent or isn't being direct with you, take some time for yourself to think about if you really want to be with her. Usually ambivalence is a ""no,"" but she's just being too polite to say so directly., Does she only want to stay “just friends?” Try not to take it personally. She may have something going on in her life that you don’t know about that’s making her send mixed signals, so it might be better for you to stay away. You deserve someone who can be completely available for a relationship., If she just wants to stay friends, and you think you can handle that, set some boundaries around how you spend time with her from now on. Because she was flirting with you or leading you on to feel like she was interested, you’ll want to change the way you do things so that you can avoid her leading you on again. Keep in mind that you might have difficulty being “just friends” with her since you’ve developed feelings.


Spend some time apart.
Unfollow her on social media. You’ll feel better if you don’t have to see everything about her all the time, especially if she’s flirting with other people.
Call her out when she flirts with you.
Avoid answering her phone calls or texts right away. You don’t have to be so convenient to her.
Spend time with her in safer group settings.

, If you are able to stay friends, you’ll need to get over any feelings you developed for your friend after she led you on. This may be challenging and may take some time, but it is possible. It will be up to you to decide if it’s good for you to have her in your life as a friend. You can work through your feelings by

:Venting. Talk it out with your best guy friends, your parents, or someone else you trust.
Focusing on your other interests and friends.
Meeting new girls and new people.

, So that you don’t get hurt again in the same way with another girl friend, remember and learn from this experience. You’re only responsible for you and can’t make someone change their flirting. But, you deserve a girl who is willing to be available for you and not use you. Don’t take what she did personally, but do remember how her actions made you feel. Now you’ll know what to watch out for with other girls!"

Most women are more naturally attuned to social cues and signals than men are, so if you're an insecure phony, they'll probably catch it. Challenge your negative thoughts and reinforce your positive ones to build self confidence. , You need to be comfortable on your own so you won't be reliant on the approval of others. If you aren't reliant on girls for approval and self-validation you'll find yourself far more comfortable around them.

, Engaging in self improvement is key to becoming comfortable and confident in your own skin. You don't need to be a genius, but improving your knowledge and learning new skills will help you become more self assured and confident.You'll also never lack for an interesting answer when a girl asks you what is new!

, You don't need to look like a bodybuilder or athlete, but taking positive steps to improve yourself physically works wonders. Not only will you feel more attractive, but your brain will release mood and confidence boosting endorphins that will improve your self esteem long before you see a difference in how you look. Improving yourself physically and engaging in activities that challenge yourself will both build confidence and get you used to pushing the limits of your comfort zone. , Force yourself to be around girls as much as possible. Inoculate yourself to their presence. Find common ground (or mention your new knowledge, hobby, or skill!) to start up conversations. No matter how much you work on everything else, you'll never learn to be comfortable around girls if you stay behind a computer screen.


More importantly, the more you are around a girl, the more likely she is to enjoy your company.There are obviously caveats for being overbearing, but for the most part girls will like more when they are around you more.

, You don't have to start by striking out on your own and spending time with a girl 1 on 1. You can meet and spend time with girls in groups of mutual friends. Make a decision to interact individually with girls when given the opportunity in this situation. You automatically have the safety net of a group for both parties to hang out with if things get awkward or you start to become nervous.


You can also use a social group as a low pressure opportunity to invite a girl to spend time with you when she perhaps she wouldn't have otherwise. Example: ""Hey Becky, my friends and I were going to see the new movie. Have you seen it yet? We thought you might like to come.""

, It is time to practice building connections. In an unobtrusive way, try to listen for and observe the habits and interests of girls. Use these observations to strike up conversations with girls. More often then not, they'll be happy to talk about the subject, giving you a low stress opportunity to listen and have them drive the majority of the conversation. For example:


Compliment a girl on her new hairstyle and ask why she decided to change it.
See that a girl is wearing school or community sports apparel, mention that you like the sport, and ask how long she has been playing.
Notice a girl's tan and ask if she has been to the beach recently.
Observe palm calluses or scraped shins and ask when she got into weightlifting.

, Once rapport has been established, you can try to get girls' phone numbers or social media contact information. This doesn't have to seem like asking a girl out - but it sure is good practice! The ability to chat over text can help you learn to talk to girls in any environment.


Be sure not to get tied to only communicating electronically! It is a good start and good practice, but not everything!

, When asking for a girl's contact information, it is okay if they decline. It shouldn't shake your confidence, nor should you become pushy. Even the best baseball players fail to get on base over half the time. Don't let rejection get you disappointed.


Occasional rejection and disappointment are actually healthy. Getting rejected and then bouncing back will condition you to realize that rejection is totally normal and okay!, Your body language can say a lot! You don't want to be telling girls that you are nervous, or worse, that you don't want to talk to them.Your words might sound comfortable and engaging, but if your body language is off, they'll be as nervous as you are and the interaction will be awkward.


A smile works wonders! Also keep your hips and shoulders open to potential conversation partners (crossed or folded arms and hands are bad!)
Use reasonable hand motions, gestures, and eye contact while speaking. You'll appear more engaging, plus the physical movement is an outlet for stress, relaxing and soothing you.Casually make friendly physical contact when appropriate. A tap on the forearm to draw attention or a touch on the shoulder when passing are perfectly normal and are very easy physical icebreakers.

, Girls are actually very much like guys, and enjoy talking about many of the same things. Discover mutual interests and focus on those, or let her know that you are curious about her interests. Conversations with girls are probably easier than you think, especially when you are talking about a comfortable subject that you already like.


The most important part of a conversation? Being a good listener.If you are a good listener, both guys and girls will be more than happy to pour out their hearts and minds. The best part is that you won't even have to talk too much if you aren't comfortable doing that.
Listening is the most important communication skill you can have.Being a good listener will also demonstrate that you care about the other person, rather than being focused on yourself.

, The easiest way to not only break the ice but also build comfort in a relationship is to do things together. This doesn't have to occur in the format of a date. By having your attention focused on a particular task or activity, nervousness is less likely to creep in. It is a much more low pressure way of building comfort and getting to know one another than an extended 1-on-1 conversation or date.


Find activities that involve common interests or responsibilities. Walk your dogs or do your homework together.
Suggest new adventures that you both might be interested in. If you both do something new, you'll be more nervous about and focused on the new activity, rather than your nervousness about being around a girl."

, Some women feel most confident in a skirt and high heels. Other women feel more confident in jeans and a t-shirt. Wear what makes you feel best because confidence always makes you sexy. Don't make the mistake of wearing designer labels and believing that guys are only interested in girls that look very ""girly."" Some guys even think a girl with a tomboy streak is pretty cute. Aren't you good enough that he should like you for who you are?

, When you are being and looking yourself, you are guaranteed to attract people who want what you have. The only problem is that some will want to nurture you while others will want to exploit you. Open your eyes and ears, and it's fairly easy to tell who is who. This then brings to the next step...

, Never be in a hurry. Wait until you have sufficient data by which to judge someone before you give them too much of your time and attention. This is handy for warding off both the jerks and the guys who will put you in the friend zone (even after - if - they've slept with you). A guy who needs an ego feeder is playing the modern male version of the Rapo game from the book Games People Play. They seduce you, and then all of a sudden claim that either they didn't want a relationship, or they just wanted to be friends. Whichever brand of time-wasting ego suckers you're dealing with, both are bad news. They not only take away your free time and mental space to talk to other guys, but they tend to make territorial gestures that keep other guys away.

, Make yourself physically off limits to them. If they don't get the point, then tell them flat out that public displays of affection are for boyfriends only.

, If it means he has to sit with your parents, have him do this before he can get too close to you. If it means taking you to the cafe to sit and chat with your mutual friends, then do that too. Having an accountability factor for your partner improves your reputation by showing that you do have standards and also shows people that guys are not afraid to be seen with you. Men need to compete. Let them do it. If they think you're not worth it, then you know what you're dealing with.

, Sit some time and have one of your friends videotape a night out with you. It'll be very enlightening. You might be too prissy, or you might be too frumpy. What you want to be, if you intend to be a guy magnet, is reasonably approachable... sexy and yet respectable... huggable.

, You don't have to have the ""perfect"" body or face. Most people have the basic natural equipment for beauty built in. Even if you have fairly serious looks problems or differences though, you can still be just as sexy and huggable as the media clone next to you if you smell good and look like you put some time and effort into your hygiene and grooming.

, Let the guy call you sometime. If he's interested or worth pursuing, he will. Even if he is submissive, he still needs a chance to be a man.

, You don't need to be a total prude, but you do need to leave the plate on the table when you eat, chew with your mouth closed, and look at people when they're talking to you.

, Look in their eyes. If they like you, they're going to be trying to catch your eye. When you catch their eye, hold the gaze a little longer than usual, and when you break the eye contact, blush. Guys think it's cute when you blush. Don't worry if you can't blush though.

Love yourself.,
Be (reasonably) happy being alone.,
Get some experience.,
Don't settle.",How to Find the Right Partner or Spouse1," Seriously -- loving yourself before you find the person you want to spend the rest of your life with is the easiest way to ensure that you'll be committing yourself to that person for the right reasons. You don't have to be 100% satisfied with yourself, but if you're unhappy with who you are, you're at risk of getting together with someone just because he or she makes you feel better about yourself.


In a sense, yes, the person you marry should ""complete you,"" making you feel completely whole as a person -- but you should already love who you are and feel blessed that the person you want to be with makes you feel even better!
You should be happy with who you are, what you do, and how you look -- this will not only make it easier for you to attract people with your confidence, but it will make you look for an equally amazing person who will only make your life better, not the person who can fill in all of the gaps in your unsatisfactory life.;
, Let's face it -- being single when all of your friends are happily dating or married is no picnic. You may want love more than anything in the world, and it's natural for you to feel lonely or sad if you can't find it. But part of loving yourself is loving spending time solo, and finding ways to stay interested and excited about life without a significant other. This will make you feel even better when that special person comes along!


If you're miserable by yourself, then you will be too easily swayed by the first person who comes along and gives you something to do. Don't mistake companionship for love.

, If you find your first love when you're sixteen, then you are a rare and lucky breed. However, most people do not in fact marry their first, or second, or even their fourth boyfriend or girlfriend. Dating more people lets you understand the endless ways that a relationship can work, and can make you see that there are so many forms and dynamics that a relationship can have.


Though you shouldn't ditch the person you love just to play the field, if you think you're just ""pretty happy"" with the person you're with but have never dated anyone else, it's better to see what's out there than to settle.
Dating a lot of people helps you learn to compromise, and will make you even more sure that what you feel for your future spouse is truly special.
Getting some sexual experience never hurt anyone either. If you've had a few partners before you've met your special someone, you'll be even more sure that the chemistry you share is truly special.
If you end up committing to the first person you've been with without being truly happy, you may spend the rest of your life wondering about what's out there.

, Not settling is related to loving yourself, loving being alone, and having some experience. People settle all too often because they find someone who makes them feel less alone and loved, even if it's not in the right way. Another reason people settle is because they've been with the same person for five years and realize they ""might as well"" get married because that's what everyone else is doing or because they've been together for so long that it's the only logical step.


You should only get married because that's what you want, not because it's what the other person wants, because it's what your family wants, or because you're too scared to say goodbye.

Be playful.,
Stay effortlessly in control of the situation.,
Keep your reactions low-key.,
Casually initiate affection, but never be desperate.,
Don't place any expectations on your social interactions.,
Be funny.",How to Be Smooth with the Ladies1," Experts agree: for many women, one of the most attractive traits a man can have is a sense of playfulness. It's not hard to see why — talking to people who are playful and enjoy the spirited back-and-forth ""dance"" of a feisty conversation is a lot more fun than talking to people who are earnest but uninteresting. Keep keep a sense of mischievousness when you talk to women. Look for opportunities to joke, gently tease her, and deliberately misunderstand the things she says. If she's in the mood for a little verbal back-and-forth, this can be absolutely irresistible.


For instance, let's say that you're talking to a lady you're attracted to at a party. If she says that she's in from out of town and that she's going home soon, you might try saying something like ""What, you're already sick of us?"" with a smile on your face. When she starts to protest, pretend to get exaggeratedly offended, all while smiling to make you sarcasm clear. Many women react really well to this sort of gentle, playful teasing (which some call ""flirting"").;
, There's a good reason why ladies' men are called ""smooth operators"": these types of people often have dominant personalities and know how to control (or ""operate"") social situations to their benefit. The smoothest, suavest players of all know how to lead conversations in the directions they want without even appearing to do so.


This effortlessness is key — someone who insists on dominating a social interaction but is visibly agitated about the ordeal can give truly bizarre mixed signals. Think about it: If you were having a conversation with someone who was obviously trying to woo you and was obviously nervously about it, would you be attracted? Doubtful.
Don't bother with ""pick up artist"" guides that encourage you to use carefully-planned routines of back-handed compliments and psychological tricks to attract women. Remember, if you're basically reciting from a script when you're talking to a woman, you're not really effortlessly in control of the situation, are you?

, We've all seen it on TV and in the movies — the quiet yet dashing bad boy who says almost nothing but seems to get girls without even trying (e.g., ""The name's Bond. James Bond.""). While popular entertainment can sometimes create some unhealthy attitudes towards dating, there is a tiny kernel of truth here. Being cool and understated can make a man more attractive to women. Try to react to almost everything that happens around you casually, as if it's completely natural. Being at ease no matter what happens is a supreme show of confidence, and confidence is almost always sexy.


To be clear, this doesn't mean you need to be tight-lipped about everything. It does mean, however, that if you see an opportunity to play coy and spark a little intrigue in your conversation, you should take it and see what happens. For instance, if a lovely lady casually asks where you live, you might respond with, ""Oh, why? Were you planning on going there later?"" It's a little cheesy, but with a response like this, you're revealing nothing about yourself and getting a playful dig at your female companion in at the same time.
It's especially important to have a low-key reactions to being rejected. If you're trying to start conversations with lots of different ladies at a party, there's a chance that some (or even all) of them won't be interested in talking to you. This is OK. React to each rejection with no more hurt feelings than if you've just been told your shoes are untied.

, Let's be honest — if you're trying to ""be smooth"" with the ladies, you probably eventually want to engage in a little mutual affection with them, whether this is kissing, having sex, or just holding hands (hey, everyone starts somewhere). This is great — healthy, mutual displays of affection are wonderful things. Keep this in mind when you're in situations with ladies where you want to initiate affection. Truly smooth men aren't scared or ashamed of making their intentions known. However, they're also not needy or desperate. Not only is desperation tremendously unattractive to most people, but it also demonstrates low self-worth (and smooth guys always have high self-worth).


For example, let's say that you've just wrapped up a great first date with a wonderful lady and you're walking out of the restaurant together. If you feel a strong attraction and want to hold her hand, casually grab hold of it as you move through a crowd of people as if it's perfectly natural. Don't make a big production out of the act — do it as if you haven't even thought about the implications. If she appears ill at ease or loosens her grip, you can easily follow her lead and let go without making the situation awkward, but if she reacts well, hold on tight!

Note: Real smooth guys aren't creeps. Being casually affectionate is one thing, but harassing women or violating their personal space is another, so keep your hands to yourself or you may be wearing a palm print on your cheek for the next few days.

, Genuinely smooth guys enjoy what they do. They like having playful, intriguing conversations with women. They don't do this just to get what they want. Any sort of romance or dating success that comes their way is a happy by-product of them doing what they love, not something that they agonize over and ""fight"" to get. When you're talking to a woman you're attracted to, don't have an endgame in sight. Just say and do what comes naturally. If your conversation naturally leads you to romance, great. If it doesn't, that's that — you had fun anyway!


This is one reason why you may want to shy away from ""pick up artist""-style seduction guides. These guides are often written with one goal in mind (sex, obviously), and while their routines may or may not work on some small subset of women, they'll never get you the genuine joy that comes from naturally, effortlessly connecting with another human being.

, Everyone enjoys a good laugh. Humor makes everybody feel good, so if you can gain a reputation as a funny person, other people (including ladies) will naturally want to be around you. Try to look for opportunities to make light of the situation you're in or (gently) poke fun at the people around you. Most people have the natural ability to be funny when they're relaxed and around people they like, but if you really feel like you're having a hard time being funny, you might want to try researching the topic (our guide to being funny is a good place to start).


Be careful with self-deprecating humor. While a few exceptional individuals can manage to be sexy while making fun of themselves (like the male leads in Woody Allen movies), it's a risky move for most ordinary people, who may unintentionally make themselves look self-conscious or insecure with this type of approach.

Think of people who make you happy. Write down their qualities. Are these the qualities you want in a partner?
Evaluate your own personality. Most people are happiest with someone of a similar personality, so rank your own qualities as well.;
, Think about everything you want to achieve in the next few years. How do you envision your perfect boyfriend fitting into this plan?


Goals might include: work or school related accomplishments, working toward greater mental stability and happiness, starting a family, traveling, etc.
You'll want to find someone who won't impede any of these goals. For instance, if your goal is greater mental stability and happiness, but you meet a really handsome, smart, work-oriented guy who neglects his own happiness and mental health, you might want to pass.
Imagine the ideal length of the relationship. Do you want a perfect summer fling? A great boyfriend for the rest of school? A future husband? This is important because you need to know which of your goals to protect.

, All relationships involve a degree of sacrifice. What are you absolutely unwilling to give up? A close relationship with your family? An independent living space? Your great friend group? Are you unwilling to move? Is there a political or religious issue that you need to agree on?


This will guide you as you find your perfect guy. For instance, if you want to stay in your hometown, you should date someone who is also from there or who says they really want to stay there.
If you want to be able to prioritize your career, you need to find someone who is willing to take on a more supportive role, or who is equally career-focused and will prioritize your career advancement as much as his own.

, You like your friends, your friends like you, and they probably know some guys you'll find perfect. Spend time with your group of friends, and organize activities in which everyone invites other friends along. Ask your friends to set you up with guys they think you'll like.


Be careful not to date someone one of your friends likes—check before you ask him out.

, To find someone perfect for you, attend events for things that you are passionate about. You'll meet people you have at least one thing in common with that way! Go to social spaces like gallery openings, poetry readings, concerts, protests, and religious gatherings.


Make a point of talking to several new people at every gathering you attend. Don't just chat up the cuties—if you make friends, they'll introduce you to eligible men.

, You won't be able to tell if he's perfect for you right away, but do yourself a favor and see if he's a stable person before you start looking for perfection. Observe how he treats others. If he's nice to you, but very critical of others, he's probably also very critical of you when he's talking to others.If he complains about his exes or other women, or refers to women as ""crazy"" or ""hysterical,"" he's probably a terrible boyfriend.
If he criticizes you, even if he balances it with compliments, he's trying to manipulate you.
Listen to how he talks about himself. Does he brag a lot? Does he tell stories in which he's completely the hero or completely the victim? These are signs of instability.
Watch out for ""too good to be true."" Ironically, if he seems perfect, he's probably manipulating your view of him.

, If he seems like a stable person, check to see if he's interested in you. He isn't perfect for you if he isn't attracted to you—you need to both see signs of compatibility.


Does he ask you questions? If he does, he's trying to learn about you.
Look at his feet and hips. Are they pointed at you when you're talking? When you're in a group? These are unconscious signs that you're the one he's most interested in., If you think he's stable, exhibits the qualities you were looking for, and is attracted to you, ask him out. Some ways to ask him out include: asking him if wants to get a meal sometime, asking him if he'd like to take a walk and continue your conversation, or giving him your number and telling him to call you.


You can also wait until he asks, but make sure to talk to him, smile at him, and flirt with him while you wait.

, If you think you've found Mr. Perfect, check in with your feelings. How does it feel to talk to him? Exciting and tingling feelings are good, as they're signs of attraction. Equally important is that you leave the conversations feeling good about yourself—like you are a good person who deserves to be happy.


Do you feel capable around him? Strong? These are excellent signs.
If he makes you feel nervous and unworthy, these are bad signs.

, You might find there are things you really like about your partner that you hadn't put on your list. For instance, he might be really open with his emotions, or he might have a way of always being down for fun.


It's great if you meet someone who becomes the ""new perfect""—not the guy you wanted, but the guy you really need.

, ""Perfect"" doesn't mean flawless. It means perfect for you, for your own imperfect life. Find a boyfriend who shares your values, who has the qualities you most admire, who makes you feel good, who supports your goals, and who treats you well. That's perfect.

Compile a list of the most important aspects of your life and personality. This list can include things like hobbies, people, goals and ideals.






Set future goals for yourself. If you want to be married in the next five years, it is important that the man you date is in the same place in his life.





;
, These can be emotional, professional and even physical desires, but be sure not to become obsessed with superficial appearances.


Think of personality virtues that are important to you. Some desirable traits might be kind, funny, energetic, outgoing or optimistic.






Consider occupational stability. Ask yourself what you'd like your future husband to be in his professional life - does he occupy a comfortable 9-to-5 desk job or is he a risk-taking entrepreneur that travels the world?






Identify the beliefs that you want to share with your partner. For example, it may be very important that you share the same religious or political views, and this can influence where you look for a potential partner.






Envision what you'd like your guy to look like, but be realistic. It's important to be physically attracted to your man, but don't get caught up in searching for perfection. It's easy to find physical faults in people when you're looking for them, so focus on his personality first.

Consider the qualities you want in a spouse.,
Consider the qualities you don't want.,
Get ready to compromise (on some things).",How to Find the Right Partner or Spouse2," Though you may never know exactly who is the perfect fit for you until you lock eyes with that person and your world stops, you can definitely think about the qualities that you are most looking for in your future spouse. These qualities may be so important to you that you would have a hard time even considering a person who doesn't possess some of them. Here are some things to think about as you choose your future spouse:


Religion. If you're Jewish and want to marry Jewish, ""stick with your own kind"" since not everyone who wants to marry a Jew will convert to Judaism.
Family values. Are you dying to have five kids, or do you refuse to have children under any circumstances? Though people may change their minds more than you think, this is something to consider as you look for someone who shares your ideas (though you shouldn't talk about this right when you meet someone, obviously.)
Personality. Though you can't predict someone's personality in advance, there may be a few things that are a must for you. Do you have a killer sense of humor and absolutely need a person who shares your love for laughter? Are you naturally a bit nervous and need someone who is more laid-back to center you? Keep this in mind as you look for the perfect person for you.
Attitude toward relationships. Are you looking for someone who wants to spend every waking second with you, or do you want someone who really understands the meaning of ""alone time""? This is more important than you think.
Social bearing. Do you want someone who is fun and has a ton of friends around, or a person who is more reserved with just a few close and loyal friends? If you're a social butterfly and your special someone is more of a wallflower, you can bring out his social side -- or it can be a problem.
Similar interests. Though the person you love probably shouldn't share all of your interests, or maybe not even many of them, you should still have a few interests that you both can share so you can keep your relationship going. If you're a novelist and your loved one refuses to read, or if you're a fitness instructor and he has never seen a gym, you may run out of things to talk about. But maybe not! This one is fluid.

, The qualities you don't want in a future spouse can be just as important and decisive as the qualities you are looking for. As you start looking for your soul mate, you can think about the things that are absolute deal breakers that will make it impossible for you to get hitched no matter what. Here are some things to consider:


Lack of attraction. Physical attraction can grow, but it is not overrated. Though you may not want to rip off your husband's shirt fifty years -- or hey, a few years -- down the line, you should have a baseline of attraction that keeps things going. Even if the person fits the mold in all other aspects, sadly, you just can't force yourself to be attracted to someone.
Lack of agreement on something that really matters to you. If you're a die-hard tree-hugging liberal and he's obsessed with Mitt Romney, then you may have a problem. But you never know -- you can have fun disagreeing about some things. But if there's something that defines who you are that your future spouse absolutely doesn't understand, then you may have a problem.
Geographical incompatibility. You may have found the love of your life, but he may live in Hawaii. If you literally live a world apart and neither of you will move under any circumstances, it won't work.

, Though making a list of all the things you want and don't want can help you have a better sense of what will truly make you happy, the truth is that you won't ever be able to find the person who satisfies all of your needs -- and that's OK. The right person for you will be the one that makes you the most happy, and that person may even fulfill some needs that you didn't know you had.


Don't turn a person down because he doesn't meet all of your needs. This is unrealistic and being too picky won't get you very far.
Don't stay with a person if you know he doesn't meet the needs that really matter to you. Though you should be flexible, don't stay with a person if you know he won't give you what you want in the end.
Find a balance between finding a person that really makes you happy without sacrificing the things that really matter to you.

Ask your friends.,
Find someone who shares your interests.,
Find someone at work -- without breaking any rules.,
Find someone online.,
Be open wherever you go.",How to Find the Right Partner or Spouse3," Many couples meet because of mutual friends. Though it may seem unlikely, you may end up married to your friend's cousin or former roommate. You can be open to being set up by your friends, who will know your personality as well as the personality of the person they want to set you up with. Or you can just go to a gathering with one of your friends, who may have an idea of a certain single person there that would be perfect for you.


Don't be shy -- your friends know what makes you happy and can help you find that perfect person without being too obvious about it.

, Common interests can make a relationship thrive, so look out for any special people who share your interests, whether you lock eyes with a cute guy in your yoga class, notice someone cute reading your favorite book in a coffee shop, or if you really click with that girl in your grad school class. The common interest can be a launching point for an exciting relationship.


The common interest will also give you an easy opening for a fun first date; if you're both into something, you can just do that thing together and see where it goes.

, It's a known fact that more people meet at work than they would admit. It makes sense: in a given day, you may spend more time with your coworkers than anyone else, and if you love what you do, then you and that person may have similar interests.


Though you shouldn't actively pursue your coworkers because that could be breaking your company code, if you really feel an attraction to someone in your workplace, be open to the possibility that this person could end up being really special -- as long as you follow company policy.

, Online dating has become one of the easiest ways to meet your future spouse. Online dating sites help you narrow down your choices based on common interests and other important qualities, and people who join online dating sites tend to be more serious about committing for life. About 20% of current relationships started online, so don't be shy about joining the trend.Even if you're squeamish about this option, just give it a chance. You can always end your membership if it doesn't work out.

, It's true: you really can meet your future husband at a loud, smelly, bar. Though it's less likely, the perfect person can come up to you at any time at all, so don't put your blinders up at the wrong time. Though you shouldn't be looking for your future husband at a company meeting or at a funeral, you should be open to the possibility that love can strike at almost any time. If you're receptive, then more people will be receptive to wanting to get to know you.

Make sure you're compatible.,
Give it time.,
Make sure it's mutual.,
Make sure you can be yourself.,
Share the same long-term goals.,
Picture that person in your future.",How to Find the Right Partner or Spouse4," Compatibility is incredibly important. That special person may pass every future-spouse test with flying colors, but when you're together, you may find that there's just a lack of...something. Maybe you just don't really ""get"" each other; maybe you always end up bickering; maybe you just can't talk without running out of things to say after a few minutes. If you're not compatible, you're not compatible, and there's nothing you can do to change that.


Sexual attraction is different than compatibility -- it wears off. Compatibility means that your personalities really work well together, and that things just click for you more often than not.

, Though you may have been wanting to get married for twenty years, you shouldn't start running down the aisle after two weeks with the person you think is Mr. Right. Even if you just have ""that feeling,"" it's very risky to marry someone you've known for just a few months, or even just a year. Give the relationship enough time to know that your feelings aren't just based on attraction, that you can get through some ups and downs together, and that you can really truly see a lifetime of happiness with that person.


You may think that you're absolutely sure after just a few months, but this won't give you enough time to test the relationship.

, You may be absolutely gaga for your special someone, but you need to have the sense that he's feeling it too. Or -- you need to make sure that he's not crazy about you, while you're just feeling ""pretty happy."" Both of you shouldn't be crazy about each other and completely excited for the rest of your lives together to move on.

, Though marriage will naturally change two people as they become bonded more closely, make sure that the person you want to be with lets you truly be yourself instead of trying to be some ideal person. If your friends or family tell you you're not being yourself around that person, it's a bad sign. But you will know if you really can't be who you are around that person, because you'll feel yourself holding back.

, You may love being with that person for a year or two, but you should make sure that you have the same vision of the future -- whether it's settling down in a nice house with two kids, or traveling the world and being nomads together. Though life is unpredictable and neither of you will be able to do exactly what you want, your visions of the future shouldn't be wildly different or you'll run into a lot of trouble.

, If you've really found your spouse, then you should be able to imagine being with that person for the rest of your life. That is probably a very long time, so make sure that you really mean that you want to see that person grow old, to have kids with that person (if that's what you both want), to support each other's careers or other pursuits, and to truly become life partners. ""I do"" means ""I do want to be with you forever,"" not ""I do want to be with you for a while.""


If you really cannot imagine the rest of your life without that person, then congratulations -- you have found the right partner or spouse. Now have an incredible journey!

Fake it until you make it.,
Use powerful body language.,
Use appropriate eye contact.,
Relax!,
Get out and live a little.",How to Be Smooth with the Ladies2," When you're stressing out about a high-pressure social situation you're in, it can be difficult to remember that everyone around you can't tell you're nervous unless you show or tell them you are. This means that if you have the right attitude and you control your behavior in the right ways, they never need to know! Simply acting confident is usually enough to fool people into thinking that you are. Best of all, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy — usually, acting confident can help make you feel confident, which will make it easier to look confident, and so on.


For starters, try acting like everything you do is natural. Don't hesitate over any decision and don't agonize over how to perform small, unimportant actions. For instance, if you're at a party and you want to ask someone to dance, don't think about it — just do it! Go right over to the person you've set your eyes on and ask, ""Hey, do you want to dance?"" That's all you need to do.

, Always remember — look the part, be the part! If you look like you're confident and self-assured, you may as well be confident, because other people won't be able to tell the difference. If you're naturally shy or introverted and you're trying to be smooth, using confident and dominant (but relaxed) body language can immediately improve your prospects with the ladies. Below are just a few tips for the uninitiated:Stand up straight with your shoulders pulled gently back. Doing this makes you appear larger, puffs out your chest, and usually makes whatever muscles you've got look as good as possible.
Hold your head high. Keeping your head up makes you appear proud, confident, and unafraid of your surroundings. However, don't look down your nose at others — this can appear snobby or condescending.
Don't be afraid to take up space. Confident people aren't afraid to have a broad, relaxed stance. If you're sitting down, don't be afraid to sit back and spread your legs a little. If you're standing around other people in a crowded area, don't recoil from others if you accidentally brush against them.
Don't cross your arms. This makes you appear closed-off and inaccessible.
Don't stare at your phone. This makes you look busy and preoccupied and will discourage people from talking to you.

, Confident people aren't afraid to look other people in the eye (especially if these other people are attractive, interesting women). There's a reason that looking someone in the eye is traditionally seen as a sign that someone is genuine. Doing this gives the impression that you're open, un-intimidated, and attentive. On the other hand, an unwillingness to look someone in the eye can make you seem like you're ashamed, nervous, or hiding something, even if you're not. Try to look people in the eye most of the time when you're talking to them, and when you're not talking to them, use a few seconds of steady eye contact to spark someone's interest from across the room.


Don't stare or leer at women — too much eye contact can definitely be a bad thing! If you're talking to a woman, feel free to maintain fairly steady eye contact, but if you're not, looking her in the eyes for more than a few seconds at a time can put her seriously ill-at-ease.

, Quick, what's the hardest thing to do once you're commanded to do it? If you guessed ""relax"", you're right. Actively trying to relax is like swimming in quicksand — the harder you work, the less progress you make. If you find yourself stressing about difficult social situations, unfortunately, there is no single ""right"" way to get to the point where you can relax in the same situations. Everyone relaxes in different ways. However, many people see success with a few common methods, listed below:


Mentally downplaying the importance of the situation or poking fun at it
Exercising
Getting lots of sleep
Deep breathing exercises
Meditating

, Picture this: you're chatting with a lady you're attracted to and you're playing things coy (as any smooth operator should), withholding information about yourself just enough to keep her intrigued. Let's say that things go well and you arrange a date for the weekend — when you eventually do start to tell her about yourself, would you prefer to present yourself as a complex, interesting person, or as someone without any dreams or ambitions who mainly just watches TV and browses the internet? The answer should be obvious. Truly smooth men back up their suave mystique with actual interesting lives. They spend time pursuing their passions and trying new things. Not only will making an effort to get out and experience the world make you appear more interesting — it'll also give you the confidence that only a wealth of life experiences can.


If you're looking for new hobbies, start with something that interests you or that you naturally enjoy and try to become great at that thing. Do you like working with your hands? Start making your own furniture. Do you like music? Pick up a cheap instrument at a pawn shop and start practicing. Do you love video games? Even this can be a source of interesting experiences if, for instance, you participate in gaming tournaments or make a gaming channel on YouTube.

"
"
Don't be ashamed of your interests.,
Look for women where you naturally hang out.,
Have your own style.,
Be open and sincere.,
Love thyself before loving others.",How to Be Smooth with the Ladies3," Ask the average person what a ""smooth guy"" is like and you'll probably get an answer along the lines of, ""He's impeccably handsome, cool, confident, and well-dressed, with tons of masculine hobbies and interests."" While the first four items in this list can certainly be a big help in the dating game, the last is hardly the end-all-be-all it's often made out to be. Don't feel a need to conceal or lie about the things you like to do. If you're geeky, be unabashedly geeky. If you like to do something really bizarre, like watch syrupy French romance films from the silent film era, don't hide this fact — it's super cool to like something unique! Being 100% honest about how you like to spend your time makes you seem genuine and confident and distinguishes you from everyone else around you.

, Clubs, singles bars, and other traditional dating ""hot spots"" are great for people who are in their element when the music's blaring loud and everyone around them is drunk. For everyone else, it may be much easier to meet people elsewhere. For starters, try meeting women at places and events that you naturally enjoy attending. For instance, if you like exercise and the outdoors, you might want to try running in a popular park. By using this approach, you're more likely to meet women that you have things in common with than you would be simply visiting a local club.

, We've all heard it before: ""Be yourself and you'll go far."" This age-old advice is a little cheesy, but when it comes to smooth operators, it's completely true. Smooth guys don't follow others when it comes to defining themselves — they do what they want to do and present themselves how they want to be presented and let others judge them as they see fit. Having your own unique personal style makes you hugely more interesting and memorable than trying to be someone else's idea of ""cool"", so being yourself isn't only easier than being trendy, it's also smarter if you're trying to win people over.


One way to immediately and visibly differentiate yourself from other people is to dress in a way that's not 100% ordinary (while obviously not completely absurd either). For instance, you might want to try buying your clothes at a second-hand store or a vintage shop for a worn-in, retro look or even making your own clothes and accessories by knitting or sewing them yourself.

, When it comes to pursuing women, honesty is the best policy. For the most part, everyone (ladies included) can tell a phony from a genuine person, so trying to act like someone you're not or conceal your true feelings will just lead to mutual feelings of awkwardness. Besides this, most women think sincerity is cute,so you have almost no reason not to be completely honest and open about your thoughts, opinions, and intentions. The absolute worst-case scenario that can occur from being honest is that you lose the opportunity to date someone, but if you would have had to lie about the way you feel to date this person, would you ever have been completely happy with them? Probably not.


For instance, if you've got certain ""dealbreakers"" — things that you simply can't tolerate in your significant other, you'll definitely want to be open and honest about these with your partner (or potential partner). Think about it: would you rather spend a few weeks pretending to be into someone who smokes, belches, and listens to Limp Bizkit all day, or would you rather politely nip this relationship in the bud?
Note that, however, there is such a thing as over-sharing. While you'll want to be sincere about your thoughts and feelings, you probably won't want to make things awkward by bringing up intensely personal information before you truly get to know someone.

, You can't love other people if you don't love yourself, so if you have a lousy opinion of yourself, steer clear of romance until you do. Ideally, romantic relationships should be the cherry on top of a happy, satisfied life — experiences that are truly wonderful to have, but not things that you need to be happy. Smooth men are always at ease partly because they know that, no matter what happens in their romantic life, they'll be more or less happy regardless. To have a happy foundation for the possibility of future relationships, below are just a few of the things you will probably want your life to contain:


A reasonable amount of personal independence (like, for instance, being able to support yourself and spend your free time as you please).
The opportunity (and motivation) to pursue hobbies and interests.
Stable, satisfying non-romantic friendships.
A satisfying level of professional and/or personal achievement (like performing well at your job, becoming an important member of your community, etc.)

"
"
Be honest.,
Attend more events that interest you.,
Follow your instincts.",How to Find Your Perfect Match2," Feel free to express your true opinions and personality. If your suitor sticks around, your company was found truly enjoyable. If another date doesn't come about, you may feel rejected, but this proves that you were just not meant to be. Being honest and being true to yourself can help you avoid wasting time while dating.


Furthermore, acting the way you think your suitor wants you to act rather than being yourself can foster feelings of resentment, stress, and discomfort. These feelings do not set a solid foundation for a relationship., You might find someone there who shares the interests and more! This event and the commonalities you have will create easy talking points, and might lead to a first date.


If you love literature and art, join a book club or get active in the artistic community.
If you love to cook, take a cooking class and whip up conversation with a fellow chef.
Even if you don’t connect with anyone, you’re still doing something you love.

, Your suitor may not fit the ideal picture you had in mind, but if it feels right, pay attention to that. On the contrary, if there's anything that is disturbing to you, don't ignore the signs.


Your unconscious mind responds to situations that reflect your goals (in this case being romance), so it’s always good to trust your gut."
"
Make a list.,
Think about what you will gain.,
Look for the qualities you respect.",How to Find Your Perfect Match3," Bullet point the negatives and the positives you find in your suitor. There should always be a longer list of positives if you want to maintain a healthy relationship.


Keep adding to the list because everyday you could learn something positive or negative about your suitor.
After a fight take a look at the list. It may help you appreciate what you have, or realize what you're lacking.
This is a great exercise to put your relationship into a logical perspective. It may come in handy in times of stress. You might realize it's not your partner making you miserable, it's actually, for example, your job or your diet.

, Your perfect match should complement your current status and help you flourish.Relationships are not stagnant, they will roll and fluctuate with progression and regression. But ultimately you want to find your relationship make positive leaps and bounds.


Think about important aspects like:

Does your suitor support your goals?
Will your suitor push you to reach new heights?
Does your suitor inspire you?



, Remember the Golden Rule, ""treat others the way you would like to be treated"". If those you are pursuing lack major components that are important to you, do not overlook this.


Pay attention to how your love interest treats others. Your suitor may treat you well, but if others are treated with disrespect, take that into future consideration.
Think about what your suitor's relationships are like with their friends and family. Depending on circumstance, this could give you good insight into how your relationship might turn out.

Be confident.,
Don’t give up.,
Learn from mistakes.,
Don’t let the love-hunt consume you.",How to Find Your Perfect Match4," The quest to love is worth it and so are you! Confidence is attractive both physically and mentally, so boost your conviction and love who you are.Confident people are great salespeople. You confidently market yourself and prove to others why you are worthwhile.
Furthermore, by having confidence in your date, your date will most likely like you too. We tend to like those who like us., Don’t stop dating just because you haven’t found the one yet. More dates means more opportunities for love, it’s just statistics. Everything worth having is worth fighting for.


You may not fall in love on the first date, but you never know, it could happen on the second, 15th or even 100th date.

, With a lot of dating can come a lot of mistakes, if not on your part then on your date's part. There's a lesson in every mistake, you just have to find it.With each failed date or rejection you learn how to play the dating game better.

You’ll be more aware of warning signs and red flags.
You’ll also learn what places you thrive best in. Which kinds of dates you get the most out of (whether it be an activity or simply getting coffee).
You’ll start noticing a pattern. If you go on a ream of bad dates and relationships, look back and find commonalities. Then the next time you pursue a relationship, you can try something new.


You’ll discover more about yourself and what you really want out of life and a relationship.

, Make the effort to find your perfect match, but don’t let that become who you are. This could lead to settling for the wrong person.


Others will recognize your joy in independence, individuality is attractive. "

Open your eyes to what's around you.,
Consider blind dates.,
Look into online dating websites and matchmaking services.",How to Find the Right Guy for You2," Drawing your ideal man is a lot easier than finding him, but searching in the right places will put you on the right track. Odds are there are eligible bachelors hanging out in the same places you like to hang out.


Look at the list of desired personality traits you created and identify the hobbies you want your partner to share. For example, if you're an athletic person and you want your man to go on ten-mile runs with you every weekend, spend some extra time scouting at your gym or even your local sporting goods store.
If it's sharing beliefs that is most important to you, look for potential partners in specific communities such as religious/spiritual groups or at political meetings.

, Being set up with someone seems daunting to most, but sometimes your friends really do know what's best for you.


Talk to your friends and let them know what you're looking for. Chances are they just might know someone that fits your description.






Don't feel obligated to say ""yes"" if your friends want to set you up with someone you're really not interested in dating, even if you asked for their help.

, While it can seem creepy to people who grew up without the internet involved in every aspect of their life, internet dating has become a common place to find potential mates.


Set up a profile on a dating website such as match.com or eHarmony.com and browse around to see if you find any guys that share your interests. It might not be the old-fashioned way of doing things, but it does allow you to clearly articulate what you're looking for in a guy.
Hire a matchmaker to set you up. If you're really having trouble finding Mr. Right and have the funds, hire a love professional to find potential matches for you. After all, a matchmaker has a very specific job, and s/he might just find something that you're missing.

"
Put on your flirting face.,
Start a conversation with him.,
Be open to accepting date offers.",How to Find the Right Guy for You3," Steal quick glances and smile at the guy that you're interested in.

, Don't be afraid to spark up the conversation yourself if he doesn't start talking to you first. In the wise words of Nelly Furtado, ""chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute."" Don't let that cutie get away without a conversation.


Ask him a question or make a witty comment about what he's doing to break the ice. For example, if he just loudly lost a game of pool to his buddies, you might tease him and tell him you know a good place that he could take lessons.
Body language is just as important as each word you say. Show him you're interested by maintaining eye contact, leaning slightly forward with your body, playing with your hair and flashing him coy smiles.







, Dating is hard. It forces you into a vulnerable position where you have to talk about yourself in a favorable light over food you might not normally eat. But, it really can be fun if you approach it in the right way.


Be yourself when you're on a date. Though we often have the tendency to hide our quirky traits or nerdy obsession with Star Wars on the first date, resist the urge to misrepresent yourself.
Don't take yourself too seriously. Take the pressure off and allow your true personality to shine through. If you joke and lighten the mood, you'll encourage your date to open up and do the same.
Don't try to force a connection. If you haven't felt a spark after a few dates, let it go. Be straightforward with your date by telling him that you just aren't feeling the romantic vibes and suggesting that you remain friends.

Spend time with his family and friends.,
Take him to do activities that you like to do, and make sure you can tolerate the things that only he likes to do.,
Observe his behavior in stressful or challenging situations.",How to Find the Right Guy for You4," In order to really get to know a guy, you have to get to know the people he spends his time with.


Be careful not to confuse his friends' actions with his actions. It's important to see how your man acts around his friends, but don't hold him accountable for way his friends behave on their own.






Make an effort to get to know his family and see where he comes from.







,


If you're going to be with someone long-term, you want to make sure that he can tolerate doing the things that only interest you, even if it means he has to sit through a chick flick once in a while.






Make sure you'll be able to fulfill your part of the bargain and sit through some activities that might not be your favorite. Compromise is necessary for a healthy relationship, and sometimes you just have to let your guy monopolize the television with his favorite video game for a few hours.







,


Make sure he is able to talk calmly about problems that arise in your relationship. Small arguments are inevitable in long-term relationships, but it's crucial that your man can communicate with you if something is wrong.
Examine how he deals with stressful news. Life isn't all rainbows and kittens, and stressful situations are bound to arise. The important thing is that your guy supports you in trying times and approaches problems in a rational manner.
See how your man acts when the little things go wrong. For example, if you get stuck in a snowstorm and end up getting towed down a mountain, is he angry for days on end or does he try to remedy the situation? You want to make sure your life partner can deal with less than desirable situations instead of getting angry.

Don't ever go out to a bar, or a club, or wherever, just because you want someone to pay attention to you. The night is not a failure if this doesn't happen. If you're not having fun, it shows.;
, Make sure it's someone you're attracted to, and aim high. You won't stay interested in gaming an unattractive person.

, He should be in a group, because approaching a man by himself is like ambushing him. Most men are secretly petrified of women. Make him feel more secure (comfortable) by giving him security in numbers.

, Men are naturally competitive creatures, and throwing pheromones around a group will encourage interest in you. Start by asking a question that will get them all involved, but that will keep the competitive juices flowing. ""I'm trying to solve an argument between my friends. My friend has a boyfriend, but she's still really good friends with her ex. If it was your girlfriend, would you be okay with that?"" Palm readings are fun, and everyone wants to be involved in them.

, Being ""funny"" doesn't work, because it's silly and contrived. Being ""witty"" is key, because it shows you're intelligent, quick, and have a sense of humor. Witty girls also have great self-confidence.

, Obvious flattery will get you NOWHERE. Men are naturally predatory creatures and they need a chase. Backhanded compliments are key. They flatter him in a sly way, and encourage him to work for your approval. A great example is, ""Wow, I love your hair. It's really going to suck when you start losing it.""

, Remember, you're witty, you're fun, and you can't spend all night talking to these guys. You're in high demand. You need to buy yourself another drink. Let him know this, but tell him that you hope you'll keep running into him. Make an offhand gesture in the direction you're going, and mention you're going back to join your friends. He will keep looking for you all night, if not invite himself along.

, Don't ever be afraid to walk away. You have other friends to attend to, and you have more friends to make.

, You're comfortable with him, and he can now be comfortable with you.

, Let your eyes linger on him a little longer. Slightly angle your hips in his direction. When you speak to him, give him visual cues such as tucking your hair behind your ear (one side only, let it fall back down), or touch your chin near your bottom lip each time you say something that you want him to remember.

, A great trick is called ""triangular viewing."" Let your gaze move from right eye-left eye-mouth. This should be very subtle and it shouldn't linger too long on any point. By making the connection from his eyes (you're interested in his intellect) to his lips (you're interested in his...everything else) gives him a powerful subconscious suggestion that he can kiss you. And he will.

, If you've made a good impression (witty! fun! great kisser!), he'll want to see you again. But he might be shy. If you need to take the initiative, a good segue is, ""It's a shame I don't give out my number...I guess I'm just an ultra-modern girl, because I'd prefer to give YOU a call sometime.""

You can also be direct and open as to why you are talking to them; however, know that they may quickly tell her or pass their own judgement and refuse to help you.
Don’t lie about who you are. Be honest about everything because if she finds out that she, or anyone in her close circle, has been manipulated then you will have blown your chance.;

Don’t be rude or awkward as this can quickly be exaggerated when they talk to her about you.If she is in a different social circle, find common ground to get your foot in the door. Endear yourself to the members so that you get invited to one of their activities or to help ease your transition into their circle.

, People can tell if you are trying to put on pretense. It will take a lot of energy to keep up a charade so don’t even bother trying to manufacture yourself into someone you think her family or friends may think is good for her. She also won’t appreciate that you think you have to go through such lengths to get to know her., Make sure you have established a comfortable dynamic where you know them well enough that it doesn’t feel awkward to ask. You don’t want to ask too early and have her family be defensive or her girlfriend think that you are making conversation with her because you like her, and have her feel embarrassed after you ask about her friend. You also don’t want to ask a male friend and have it turn out to be her boyfriend.Say something nonchalant similar to, “So what’s Kimmy’s Story?” This keeps things ambiguous so it doesn’t seem like you’re asking for yourself.

If the guy has a reputation for treating girls badly, your friends will be able to warn you about him.
It will be easier to start a relationship with someone with whom you already share friends.;
, Many times, guys who share your interests may be stable, long-term boyfriends as well. If you're already active in social clubs, religious groups, or other special interest groups, consider asking someone you've already met from these groups out on a date.When people share the same interests, they're more likely to be compatible mates than people who don't have a lot in common.

, Your ideal guy may be over 6 feet tall, handsome and funny, with a large paycheck, but the guy you find yourself hanging out with might be a short and red-haired geek who works at a video store. Instead of ruling him out because he doesn't fit your idea of Mr. Right, think about what you like about being with him. Does he treat you with respect? Does he make you laugh? Is he honest, kind and thoughtful? If so, you might benefit from reevaluating your ideals.No one will meet every criteria for the perfect man. It's important to think about what qualities in a mate are non-negotiable for you.
Remember that the perfect guy might have to compromise his ideals for you too.

, A good guy will be interested in finding someone he can respect, and someone who shares his interests. If you're interested in finding the right guy, you're unlikely to find him in a place that's designed for one-night stands.This doesn't mean avoiding all bars or frat parties, though these places are often pick-up scenes.
If you're interested in a guy, make a plan to meet him another time for a date.

, Drinking alters your judgment, and lowers your ability to make good decisions about who to spend your time with. If he's a good guy, he won't encourage you to drink too much. In addition, if you drink too much on the first date, you might scare off a potential Mr. Right.If your date drinks too much when you've just met him, this is a warning sign that he might have a drinking problem. You'll be more likely to notice his alcohol use if you're moderately sober yourself.
Be aware of drink spiking. Drink spiking can be done by adding additional alcohol to your drink or a dose of medication to your drink without your knowledge.

, If you're not sure whether you have a really close connection with a guy, don't commit to him right away. Strong relationships take time, and the right guy won't pressure you to commit before you feel ready.Commitment might mean sexual intimacy for you, or it might mean other kinds of trust.
Signs of a good guy will indicate that he's interested in you, not just interested in having sex with you.

, If you don't feel like it's working out, it's okay to end a date. If you're staying to protect his feelings, because you want him to think well of you, or you don't want to seem like a prude, you're risking getting involved with the wrong guy. You're not being kind -- you're wasting your time, and his.Ways you can leave include pretending that you forgot another appointment or faking feeling sick, but you can also tell him the truth: ""I don't think this is working out. No hard feelings.""
Even if you've said you'd go on another date, it's okay to break that commitment. Just tell him that you won't be able to make it.
No matter how persistent he is, you don't owe him your time or your attention.

, Don't rely on stale pick-up lines. Instead, ask about his tee-shirt, or make a comment about the circumstances you're in. Then follow up your question with something that connects with his emotions in an empathetic way.For example, you might ask, ""What kind of coffee is good here?"" and follow it up with, ""I love dark roast -- it reminds me of a lazy morning.""
In general, it's a good idea to avoid negative comments until you know him better. Otherwise, you might accidentally offend him.

, If you ask him a question that can be answered with either yes or no, you'll do little to further a conversation. Instead, ask him what book he's reading or what he's enjoying about the event.Open-ended questions often start with words like, “What...,” “How....” “Tell me...”
There aren't any right or wrong answers to open-ended questions.

, Most guys like to talk about themselves, and asking a guy questions about himself is a natural follow-up to an introduction if you don't already know him. If you've talked to him before, you can just open a conversation by asking him questions. These questions might be about the situation where you are, such as ""What brings you to the mall tonight?"" or might be more general, such as ""What do you like to do in the summer?""Asking questions about his clothes can often be a good way to find out his interests. For example, if he's wearing a sports jersey, you can ask him if that's his favorite team.
You can also ask context-free questions of him, such as ""What kind of movies do you like?""

, Rapport is a sense of shared perspective, a comfort in each other's presence. To do this, be genuine and warm with him. Building rapport is an important part of establishing trust. Even if you've just met him, treat him like he's worthy of value and respect.Avoiding judgmental attitudes, and basing your comments in an empathetic perspective can help encourage feelings of rapport.
Try talking to him like you already know him. Don't be inappropriate, but be as casual as you would with a friend.
Your first statement or question in the conversation isn't as important as the way you continue.

, If your first social overture doesn't work, don't let it bother you. It's okay to try again to get the conversational ball rolling.You can either start a conversation about a different topic, or you can ask another question on the same topic.
The more often you try this, the better you'll become.

What is clear, however, is that the overall number of millionaires is rising. In fact, 1 out of every 13 households (all kinds) in the U.S. has at least $1 million in assets. One out of every 100 has at least $25 million in assets.How are they making their money? In a variety of ways. Extremely wealthy men are often in business, working at hedge funds and in other areas of finance and investing.
A growing number of men are making extreme amounts of money as tech and web entrepreneurs. And real estate; media, sports and entertainment; oil and gas; and other business ventures continue to be lucrative and popular areas.
There are also a large number of men making very good money in medicine, dentistry, the law, engineering, and, one mustn’t forget, in corner offices serving as CEOs.;
, In general, they work close to 60- to 80-hour weeks and are often self-made, wealthy men. They did well in school, took calculated risks, and have a long-term plan. They’re also high energy, visionary and extremely confident. Many live surprisingly modestly, are generally upbeat and recognize they’re not the smartest person in the room, at least not on every issue, so they surround themselves with people who can help them fill in the gaps, and to fulfill their vision.


Yet their confidence frequently bleeds into narcissistic behavior, and they often lack empathy for others. Feeling a sense of entitlement isn’t foreign to them either., Not all men are the same, obviously, but there are some generalities. They gravitate toward fit, attractive women who are well dressed. They have a tendency to feel entitled (there’s that word again) to “arm candy” or a woman who can plan social schedules, play hostess and the like. Yet when surveyed, roughly 90% of men who are high-achieving and considered either successful or highly successful want a woman with a brain and who is also successful.Some say, in fact, there’s been a significant shift toward brains over beauty.Research shows that when men occupy a higher social standing than women, they tend to choose young and beautiful women as partners. When they are more equal in social standing, intelligence, kindness and a good sense of humor rise to the top.Either way, they can also see a gold-digger a mile away, some say; it’s not in their nature to be gullible. If it were, many wouldn’t be where they are in life.Additionally, according to one study, 75% of wealthy men also have sex more frequently and have more sexual partners than men with less money., The wealthy in general are concentrated on the coasts. California, Florida and the northeast are particularly popular spots.Rich, single men are a bit more scattered, and there are a few surprises. According to a study done by a market research firm, these are the top 10 cities in which to find them: 1) the San Francisco Bay area, 2) Anchorage, AK, 3) Washington, D.C./Baltimore, 4) Sheboygan, WI, 5) Naples, FL, 6) Minneapolis/St.Paul, 7) Rochester, MN, 8) Boston, 9) Fort Walton Beach, FL and 10) Dallas., While you may not be able to afford the most exclusive neighborhoods or buildings, you can find something not terribly far from where the real money resides. Get as close as you can. Or settle for a shoe in the box, right in the middle. In doing so, you’ll be running errands, walking your dog, jogging, drinking your coffee, etc., in the same areas. In doing so, you’re absorbing the culture and meeting people.


This provides opportunities to become more relaxed amongst the rich and to be noticed at no (more) additional cost to you.If you can’t afford to move, simply start getting your groceries in upscale neighborhoods. Drive your car to the high-end park for your morning jog and so forth.

, If you want to be rich, you need to rich. If you don’t look and act the part, you likely won’t close the deal. You want your look to be sexy but not so much that it crosses the line into looking sleazy. Sexy but sophisticated is the way to go, investing in only a few classic pieces that can be worn with a variety of other things. Look for them at consignment shops and online at websites like eBay. Also invest in 1-2, second-hand and versatile designer handbags.Accessories such as jewelry are also important, but these are more easily faked. Pearls are classic, for instance, and don’t need to be real, and a pair of cubic zirconium stud earrings and a matching necklace will never go out of style and won’t cost a fortune.
Know the dress code of any event you attend and make sure you adhere to it. If you’re not sure, it’s always best to be a bit overdressed than underdressed.
Avoid over-tanning, wearing too much makeup, and coloring your hair in ways that looks unnatural as it’s not generally a classy look., Even if you may not have been educated in finance or political theory, you need to be well versed in the things rich men discuss. Since they are often big players in business and politics, gain knowledge in these areas through reading newspapers daily – particularly the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal – in addition to local political and business publications.


When you’re unfamiliar with terms, concepts and historical contexts, look them up online.
Being able to hold an intelligent conversation will help you stand out from others, and there will be many others.Also spend time learning about the things the rich enjoy, such as horse racing, sailing, the arts, fine jewelry, various cuisines, luxury cars, etc., The surest way to be dismissed as a gold-digger is to start asking him questions about the size of his bank account(s).The second surest way is to ask how much something he owns cost. The third surest way is to ask how much something he buys you cost. Avoid these topics … as you would with anyone else.Additionally, be very careful when asking around about how much a man is worth as your snooping could very easily make its way back to him.

, Considering they work 60-to-80 hour weeks, one way to meet them is to work with them, near them or for them. If you have an M.B.A all the better as this will qualify you for jobs in many of the industries in which they work. Alternatively, consider areas in which they spend their money, such as the sale of art; antiques; luxury cars, jets, homes and yachts.


Also think of areas such as interior design, personal training, architecture, nursing, jobs at charitable organizations, and those at country clubs and so forth that will expose you to a large pool of wealthy men.Stay away from jobs, however, in which you will wear a uniform as it can create a psychological barrier between you and the rich men you want to meet., Charity balls, silent auctions, golf tournaments, polo matches, and anything involving a cultural or medical institution are excellent places to meet rich men. Often the less familiar the cause the richer the donors as the filthy rich often take pride in supporting charities few have heard of.Now, because you often either have to be invited to these events or because tickets can cost over a thousand dollars, the way to get in is to volunteer, particularly in fundraising.


This provides you a sneak peek at the guest list, an invitation and the chance to meet people.To find out about these events, search for charities online in your city or in cities nearby.
To learn the largest donors to various causes, look at the Chronicle of Philanthropy.

, Men love sports. Rich men particularly love golf, polo, horse racing, sailing, skiing and tennis.Learn how these sports are played. Familiarize yourself with the best players, the most prestigious events and locations, and the current news in the sports. Also consider joining your local racquet club and learn to play tennis, get lessons in golfing, take boating lessons and so forth not only for exposure to the rich but also to show you know how to do the kinds of things the rich do.

, When rich men decide to dine, go out for a night on the town or travel, they expect the best so will only go to the finest establishments. That’s where you’ll want to be. Posh hotel bars and the bars of 4-star steakhouses, where they’ll have a drink before eating, are excellent places to position yourself.For the more shy rich man, look for the swanky lounge in exclusive neighborhoods.


Don’t go with a gaggle of girlfriends and never with another male; instead, go with one or two of your friends instead., Rich men buy homes, as in plural, which require art to adorn the walls. This, along with social invitations they naturally receive in this area, means they attend many art exhibits, openings and auctions. Start by attending free openings (after you’ve read up about art history) and then move on to becoming a member of museums (it’s not very expensive and gives you access to a variety of events)., Just as with charity events, volunteers are needed at many places like hospitals, political and socially oriented nonprofit organizations, museums and the like that will potentially put you into direct contact with wealthy men.Don’t, for instance, underestimate the wealth of physicians in the United States. Specialists in areas like urology, gastroenterology, invasive cardiology and surgical orthopedics make about $400,000-500,000/year on average.Hospital administrators can make over a million per year.

, There are several websites that claim to help the wealthy find mates, or the non-wealthy find rich mates. The top ones are MillionaireMatch.com, SeekingMillionaires.com, Onluxy.com and SugarDaddie.com (though this one is a bit suspect and should be regarded as such).There are also a number of “millionaire matchmakers” whom you can hire to set you up with the wealthy.


There’s no guarantee you’ll be accepted by the matchmaker, so work toward having everything else in place first to increase your success rate before going this route."

Check her ring finger.,
Search her online profile.,
Evaluate her social calendar.,
Ask yourself how she interacts with other men.,
Look for eye contact.",How to Find out if a Girl Is Single2," A wedding ring is an obvious way to know if she is single. A wedding ring is traditionally worn on the left hand on her fourth finger. Some married women may not always wear their ring for various reasons so don’t feel that a woman without a ring is 100% single., Social media is a great way to find out if she is single because they provide an outlet for her to express her relationship status. Whether she explicitly states that she is in a relationship or simply has many pictures with the same guy, you can quickly gauge whether this is something that you want to pursue.If you don’t have full access to her social media account, send her a friendship request. Be sure that you are proud of your own profile before allowing her access to see yours. There may be incriminating photos of you that may cause her to hesitate to tell you whether she is single.

, If she constantly is out with her single friends then there is a good chance that she is single as well. If you don’t know her social calendar, simply ask “what are you up to this weekend” or “did you get up to anything fun last week?If you see her out at the same bar or club within a short time span, this may be an indication that she is single and is hoping to meet someone.

, If you are in a bar or club and you see someone who does not talk to many men or is not on the dancefloor, it may be because she is not single and does not want to send the wrong message. In contrast, if you see a woman who is open to dancing and chatting with other men, there is a good chance that she is single., Whether you’re in a bar or in a grocery store, if you find that you can lock eyes and maintain eye contact, it may be indication that you have caught her attention and she is flirting with you.

Keep conversations casual.,
Ask her for coffee or lunch.,
Break the touch barrier.,
Read her body language.,
Ask yourself “how much is she telling me?” If she seems overly talkative, you may be able to surmise that she is open, friendly, and that she has a busy schedule because she is single.,
Be casual and polite.",How to Find out if a Girl Is Single3," Chat about your hobbies or ask what she has gotten up to over the weekend. She may immediately volunteer some information about whether she is single or not. She will most likely tell you if she has plans with her significant other., This is more casual than a formal date but still may be viewed as one. If she hesitates, it may be because she is not single. Better yet, she may say yes because she is single and views it as a date.Make sure you know whether she thinks that it is a date or just something between friends. You can casually ask her, “is this cool with your boyfriend?” She may laugh if she’s single or appreciate how respectful and considerate you are but either way, it can put you in her good graces.

, While she may recoil, breaking the touch barrier establishes a connection and certain dynamic. She may naturally be flirty or very self-conscious, in any scenario apologize if she recoils. She may tell you exactly why she is not comfortable, which may include that she is not single. Touching lets her know that you want to get close to her.Touch her casually after a joke or after complimenting her hair or outfit.You may touch her lower back if escorting her through a door or elevator. You may also read over her shoulder if she is classmate or coworker. While this may seem innocent, subconsciously she will know that you’re trying to get closer to her.

, If you are in a social setting and she has her arms crossed and does not maintain eye contact, she may not be interested in having a conversation with you. In contrast, if she is touching your arm or leg during the conversation, it is a good sign that she is engaged in the conversation., For example, if she never mentions a boyfriend but tells you that she goes to yoga every day, takes French lessons, and she is still looking for more activities, there is a good chance that she is single., If you are obviously probing, she may be turned off and not be forthcoming. Say something similar to, “I was just wondering,” and ask if you could take her out or even just get her number if you just met.If you are going to be direct and straightforward, make sure that you have established a rapport. She might find it offputting if you ask her without getting to know her at all.

Grow stubble.,
Wear red.,
Work out.,
Look older.,
Take care of your personal hygiene.",How to Be Attractive to Women1," Women enjoy facial hair in general but especially in the form of slightly grown out scruff. Instead of growing a full beard, do not shave for a few days so you have a bit of stubble. Studies indicate this is the type of facial hair women tend to find most attractive., Some studies indicate that red makes people think of sex and sexuality. Adding a little red to your wardrobe may make women feel slightly more attracted to you. Some studies indicate women associate the color red with success and social status as well, both of which might make you appear more attractive in their eyes., Biologically speaking, sexual attraction is rooted in who would make the best mate. Men with a stronger physique may appear healthier to some women. Women also associate strength with protective, dominant men, which many women find attractive. Spend some time at the gym weight lifting and try to get more protein in your diet to promote strength training., A few studies indicate women prefer older men. This is due in part to the increase in independence and financial security that tends to come with age. Many women prefer men who are confident and have their lives together, and this kind of self assuredness is typical in older men. Try to select wardrobe choices typical of older, professional men, like suits and ties, over more casual wear. You may also want to consider trimming your hair in a short, conservative style as this can also make you appear older., Women tend to be more attracted to men who are clean and take care of themselves. Make sure your breath is fresh by chewing gum or using a breath strip after smoking, drinking coffee, or drinking alcohol. Keep your hair brushed and get regular haircuts. Check your teeth to make sure nothing is stuck between before going out on a date or to a place where you're looking to meet women."

Be confident.,
Be humorous.,
Be nice.,
Be smart.,
Be yourself.",How to Be Irresistible to Men1," Confidence is one of the most irresistible personality traits a woman can have, so the first step to being irresistible is to learn to love yourself, warts and all!


Think about it -- how can you expect a man to think you're beautiful, smart and cool if you don't believe that you're beautiful, smart and cool?
Stop worrying about your flaws and focus on all of the things you like about yourself -- make a list or repeat positive affirmations if it helps!
Another good tip is to ""fake it til you make it."" This means pretending that you're full of confidence even if you feel shy or nervous inside. Eventually the confidence will come naturally!;
, Having a good sense of humor is always a good thing, especially on the dating scene. Nobody wants a Serious Sally. Plus, you'll look more attractive when you're laughing or smiling.


Having a good sense of humor doesn't mean that you have to be a stand-up comedian (although the ability to make a guy laugh is a bonus). You should at least be able to laugh at yourself and not take life too seriously.
Imagine a guy accidentally spills his drink on you. Do you scream at him for ruining your dress, then storm away? Or do you laugh it off and tell him he can buy you a drink to make it up to you? Which version do you think a guy would find more attractive? (Hint: It's the second one.)

, Sometimes girls think that acting mysterious and aloof will make them irresistible to men, but this is misguided. If you want a man who's kind-hearted and genuine, it's safer to play nice.


Being nice means being polite and courteous and not treating a would-be suitor like something you'd wipe off the bottom of your shoe (unless the guy's being a total jerk).
If you end up in a conversation with a guy, try to avoid talking about yourself all the time. Express an interest in him and try to really listen to what he's saying. This boosts his ego, unconsciously making him more attracted to you!
Even if you're not interested, you should try to turn the guy down gently. Think about how you'd like to be treated if the situation was reversed.

, Let's get one thing straight -- you should never, ever dumb yourself down just to make yourself more attractive to a guy.


This tactic just isn't going to attract the right kind of guy, because any man worth his salt finds intelligence attractive, or even a turn-on!
The right guy will be attracted to your sharp wits, he will appreciate your ability to hold a meaningful conversation and be genuinely interested in your opinion. So don't just sit there with a vacant expression, nodding like a bobblehead!
If you feel like you need to give your conversational skills a boost, the best thing you can do is be informed about current events -- try reading a newspaper or watching the news (if you don't already) and you'll never find yourself short on conversation material

, You've heard it a million times before - be yourself, be yourself, be yourself. Well, you're gonna hear it one more time, because it really is so important - be yourself!


Don't try to play a certain persona just because you think it'll make you more attractive. This rarely works and will just end up being exhausting. Besides, if you think a guy wouldn't like the real you, then what's the point? It's never going to go anywhere!
Of course, it's okay to embellish the truth a little when it comes to small things -- ""Sure, I love the Red Sox!"" ""Yes, I go rock climbing every weekend!"" As long as you're not outright lying, a little exaggeration is acceptable for the sake of good conversation.

Look at her and smile back.",How to Be Irresistible to Women," Don't kiss her if she doesn't want to be kissed. Instead of trying to get things out of her, think about what you can give her. However if you make her your everything, girls sometimes get turned off by that. Women do like to be the center of attention once in a while though.;
, Don't play games; unless the girl is really insecure she doesn't just want to hear you flatter her. Do what you can to catch and keep her attention, but don't play with her mind or her heart. Once you lose a woman's trust, it's near impossible to regain.

, Women can understand if you like comics! In some cases relate to it, but if that's all you talk about then you need to hit the road. If you aren't sure how to connect with a female you can always ask what her interests are and try to relate to them!

, Nobody wants a guy who acts unsure of himself. But don't become so full of yourself that you come across as cocky or stuck up.

, Girls can't stand to think that you possibly don't want them, but that isn't all that goes across their mind. They have a life and there just might be other guys, or girls so if you're going to play the game, look up the rules.

, Wear cologne that smells really good. The scent of a man is really important to women. We are very, very repelled by men who smell not so good. Just make sure that you do not use too much; a little bit is good but over-applying makes her want to run away holding her nose.

, Tell good jokes but do not try too hard. Experiment; find out what makes other people laugh and see if she reacts the same. Even if it does not make her giggle, you will be one step closer to learning how to make her laugh. But be warned: Some girls may laugh at something that they find so incredibly offensive, that they're really laughing at you for even believing that the joke itself was funny. Or they giggle because they're feeling uncomfortable. Watch your words carefully. A vast majority of girls really hate 'dead baby' and other similar jokes, but may laugh still, no matter how offended they are, for your benefit. Again, they may be laughing because they are just so astounded at the stupidity of the joke. So definitely watch the rest of their face for an expression, and don't go for the laughs alone.

, Watch closely when you are around her. You can probably tell from, for example, how romantic and sappy she is, say on Valentine's Day, or is she adorns her folders with cute animals and hearts. If she does, she probably likes it if people are sappy to her. In this case, lay on the compliments, but do not get too overboard. If you find out that she does not do any of these things, she might find it strange, creepy and intimidating if you compliment her too much. Keep the compliments subtle but nice and compliment her one feature that she would not think you would notice.

, The best thing that boys can do is smile. It helps if you have a nice smile and she definitely will love it to see you smile and see that you know how to lighten up. Be happy, though; do not take life too seriously and show her that you can laugh and you are exciting.

, Do not totally stalk her and listen to all of her conversations, but when she looks upset or sad, gently ask her if she is okay and try to help her cheer up. Try to use some of the techniques from Step Three to make her laugh. She will like you so much more if she knows that you are always on hand with a big smile and a caring heart.

, Be adventurous, exciting, and spontaneous.

, Do not let her think that if she stops talking to you that will be the end of the world. This sounds kind of bad but do not just stick to her. Live freely. Do not let her think that you are completely stuck on her, even if you are.

, On Valentine's day, get her a little teeny gift or a card or something. Don't worry, she won't embarrass you if she doesn't like you back.

, Take the teases she teases you with. Be comfortable around her. If you do something weird make a joke out of it.

, Usually, a girl who likes you will look at you a lot, especially if you two are in a class together. When you catch her looking or staring at you, look at her back and give her a smile then turn back around.


Always remember that a girl wants to be loved. If you're just in the relationship for some ""fun"", then you really can't be what she needs. Remember, guys usually like what they see and what they get, while girls like what they hear and notice. For example, if you listen to her carefully, and you can remember what she tells you, she will probably take notice.

Learn to approach.,
Learn Attraction Material.,
Be sexual.,
Why is Attraction Material Attractive?,
Apply Attraction Material: There are three ways in which you can apply attraction material: conversationally, physically and psychologically.,
Conversationally: First and foremost, getting out of your head and into a state where conversation and banter just flow from within and you find yourself laughing at your own sh*t is tough.,
Physically: Body language says more than words ever could.,
Psychologically


Assume attraction: The majority of guys think that women do not have those same urges and desires that we as men experience.",How to Be Attractive to Females You Just Met," You will never be able to attract the girl if you are unable to talk to her. Nearly all men have an irrational fear of approaching females, you are not alone. The good news is that it can be controlled quite simply!


This is the most simple step. Despite the fear that you may have, know that approaching is the easiest part.

,


What is Attraction Material? Attraction material is primarily banter and teasing so asking what they do or where they are from doesn't fall into this category. Most of it does not and should not mean anything. Think of it as conversation content which has little meaning other than to create amusement for you. In others words random nonsense coupled with some statements.

, There is a caveat, attraction material should have a hint of sexuality, otherwise you become the dancing monkey... With the added sexual element it becomes flirting. Nice guys are just... nice. Sleazy guys are... disgusting. What do they have in common? They both feel ashamed of or as though it's wrong to demonstrate their sexuality and desires. The nice guy pretends it is not there while the sleazy guy acts on it anyway, but in a way that attempts to hide embarrassment or in a way that allows them plausible deniability when called out on it. Picture the sleaze whistling or grabbing ass in a way that if (when!) he gets blown out he still gets to high five his mates. Conveying strong masculinity and ownership of your sexuality is essential, as well as being more emotive. Being around you should have that little hint of risk and intrigue. You should spike the conversation with sexual innuendo, but it is much more than that. It is proximity, body language that dominates space, kino (touch) that shows you are comfortable with your own sexuality as well as taking the lead. It is being calm and collected in a charged moment tingling with tension and occasionally spiking the interaction with some very dominant kino.

, It is not the material itself that is attractive to women. Instead, it is what the material sub communicates about you that women find attractive. When you are comfortable enough around females to banter, tease and throw out statements (cold reads) you're sub communicating a number of things:


Whilst you may want her, you certainly do not need her. Neediness in any form is kryptonite. When you are being try hard with a girl, asking her questions and hanging off her answers (Wow, you come from London, that is so cool!!), or even just trying to build rapport suggests way too much interest for someone you know nothing about. Attraction material allows you the pretense of not being that bothered about her.
You do not know her yet and as such you are not THAT interested in her. Unless she just blew you away with some serious eye from across the room, in which case create a bubble around the two of you, own the space and her and assume familiarity and that the sex (which will be mind blowing) is so obviously going to happen it does not need mentioning. For every other occasion be the high value guy who has a bunch of attractive options. In other words, her looks got her a foot in the door but what else has she got because that is not enough. So spike her emotions positively and negatively. It is having a healthy amount of disinterest, or not always allowing her to hold your entire attention. Which of the two depends on how much you want to spike and how far along in the interaction you are in terms of her investment.
You are confident. If you are confident around her than you must be used to talking to girls, therefore you have a lot of beautiful women in your life. This is called being pre-selected and it tells her that you are safe to be around, not likely to be needy, fun to be with and a high value male. In other words you're the kind of guy girls want to get with.
You have real (inner) strength. In talking in a way that serves as self amusement (bantering and having fun), you convey that you don't need the validation or approval of others to feel good about yourself. You're content being you and you're not trying hard to please others for the purpose of having them like you. Having that kind of inner strength, knowing who you are and not allowing others to put you in a box and say ""no, this is who you are"" with their opinions of you, that is the foundation of attraction and it's what makes you great. If you have that true inner strength, you know who you are, you know what you want, you have a healthy sense of entitlement, and you're unaffected by the opinions of those around you (you don't need their approval to feel good about yourself is a part of this) then you are probably very successful in other areas of life. You're likely to be very well socially adjusted, popular, charismatic, a leader of others, stands for what he believes in, someone who takes risks and reaps the rewards, who has a story to tell, and blazes his own trail. The list goes on, the point being all of those qualities are what women are attracted to. Being able to convey those, well the outcome goes without saying.
You are not afraid to be silly. This ties into the above in that it shows that you do not take life too seriously, you are not wound tight so you most likely find that success comes easy, and the trials and tribulations that make life worth living don't faze you. It also suggests that if she were to be around you, she would have a great time.

, It can be really tough getting out of one frame of mind and into another, especially if you work in a stuffy environment. The easiest way is to pretend you own the venue and act accordingly. This allows you to get comfortable in your surroundings. So walk around short setting, open, bounce, open, bounce. Ask people if they are having a good time, how they are doing, etc. Or it can be as simple as walking through a really crowded venue clinking glasses with everyone and saying hi. Just get the conversational juices flowing and start having fun interacting with people. Look to increase the length and playfulness of the interactions as you go along. It's very easy to then go back and re-open girls or to find yourself in set without planning it. Now for some more specific aspects:


Transitions (moving from one topic to another). Another area a lot of guys seem to struggle with. This can seem tricky but it's something you already do with everyone in your life and in almost every normal conversation you have without realizing it.

Conversations do not have to follow a logical path, they often go off on tangents or jump to new topics that have nothing to do with anything you were previously talking about so do not worry too much about finding ways to link conversations together. Learn a few transitions from here or the routines manual and use them. Once you find yourself getting more into the conversation you will stop needing them. Just throw stuff out there that has nothing to do with what either of you are talking about and watch how quickly the randomness is forgotten.


Teasing. This is one of those things that a lot of guys struggle with and often think that they just cannot do it. The best way to learn if you don't already know is to write out sentences girls might say and find the words in it that you can ping off, or trigger words.

Find ways to tease effectively off of them and spend some time every week just practicing doing it. Do it on your phone when you are sat with nothing else to do. When you're infield (in a club, bar, street, etc) try to find not only her words but also situational cues or observations you can tease and banter off. What she's wearing, her drink, etc.
Remember that teasing should be done in playful manner. It should not come off as mean spirited or as an insult.


Routines and cold reads. Many men are afraid of ""running out of things to say"". The biggest fear is that the dreaded awkward silence will inevitably creep in. To avoid this, you should memorize and practice a couple of stock routines and transitions as a fall back option.

The great thing about cold reads and routines is that they allow you to fill the awkward silence with the kind of things that you are maybe used to doing but in a way that generates intrigue based attraction. So saying ""you look like a stripper or an accountant, I can't tell which"" is akin to asking ""So what do you do for a living?"". Practice reframing questions as statements and use the attraction forums and Love Systems routines manuals to find some great examples of both cold reads and routines. Some more specific examples will be included in a bonus section at the end of this wiki.


False Disqualifiers: Statement that display a healthy level of disinterest, while also acting as a way to convey interest in a flirtatious way. For example, ""I can already tell you and I aren't going to get along"" or ""If you weren't so dorky I'd probably be trying to get into your pants right now, shame you're a nerd"".

, It can either reinforce the calm, cool, collected, fun loving, etc persona that you are attempting to portray, or betray you and expose it as an act.


Keep your back straight, shoulders back, chin up, even leaning back slightly and with a smile on your face or a shit eating grin as though you know something they do not. Own your space and be aware of your presence, which should be bold and large.

To understand what it looks like, try to imagine you have a piece of string attached to your head and you are dangling from it, your spine is as straight as it can be in this situation, that is how you should be.


When you are walking down the street in your day to day life, keep your head up. You will notice how uncomfortable it feels and how you have to fight the desire to look down or away. Don't! Stay strong and witness the outcome. Keep a smile on your face and maintain eye contact, girls will smile back, guys will look away or nod nervously. In the eyes of strangers you must be very high value to have that confidence.
When seated take up space, relax, and try to be as horizontal as possible without it seeming weird. Be James Dean.
Movement should be slow and deliberate, never fidgety or erratic. Imagine you are shoulder deep in water, now walk.
Never face the girl completely until she is facing you. This can telegraph significant interest. Only give her your full bodily attention when it's on. Like all things game, play with this until it feels comfortable, and study your friends and others as they interact with each other. Watch how one person will be trying for the attention of the other. Two people talking will rarely have both parties facing each other directly. Don't be the one trying for the attention.
Lock in or lean on something to make yourself comfortable. For most guys (you included) locking is important and you should do it as soon as you can. If that means moving people around then just do it, remember bullshit baffles brains so keep talking random banter while you move them.

As a concept it doesn't seem to feed into the progression model as you cannot be dominant, Kino escalate or create a bubble around the two of you with proximity and vibe whilst trying to look cool leaning against a wall. These things should occur in spikes only. Whenever you are talking normally try to find something to lean against.


Use takeaways to show some disinterest. A takeaway simply means taking away your attention, or interest, in order to spike her emotions. You can do this in a number of ways that starts with very subtle glances down at your finger nails or at your cigarette as she is talking. There are more medium plays such as getting your phone out to read a text quickly. Very blatant takeaways include turn your back when she says something stupid or that you fake disapproval of. What you are doing is giving her the gift of missing you and spiking that emotion that makes her want to cling on to you and keep you around.

Some other takeaways are crossing your arms, looking over her shoulder, re-organizing something at the table (not fidgeting), etc.


Kino (touching). The topic of Kino is very extensive and covered elsewhere so this will be brief. When you begin, you should push yourself faster than you think is possible. Go way beyond what you think the girl will positively respond to and be completely unashamed doing so. No, this does not mean you should be foundling her breasts or pinching her ass while introducing yourself.

Take her hand, lead her around with confidence and she will follow. Gently rub your hand down her forearm and hook her hand with two fingers whilst talking. Hold it like that for a few seconds then let go.
Put your hand on the back of her shoulder and lean in to talk into her opposite ear, whilst applying gentle pressure to the shoulder to make her feel as though you are bringing her to you (done when very close already). The next time you do the above, put your hand with your thumb touching her neck.
Put a hand on her hip whilst talking to her.
Move her around, literally. Move her body with your hands. Make her stand to one side, push her up against a wall or the bar (covered below in Dominance).
When talking into her ear, after the 2nd or 3rd time, gently caress the hair from her ear and hold her head that way.
Bump heads gently as you come away from her ear.
Stand really close (covered below in Proximity)


Proximity: You do this when the girl shows you some signs that she is attracted to you, which can happen instantly if you approach positively. It can help to create the kind of chemistry most interactions are lacking. For example, step in close, deep into her personal space and create a sense of excitement by not saying anything. Look her in the eye, look away over their shoulder than return to the eyes. This kind of tension creates huge amounts of attraction but only works when you have some to begin with. Otherwise it's just creepy. Using Proximity when you don't have a lot of attraction is still important, though you should temper it with less risky or tense conversation, and do it in mini spikes.

Final note on proximity. It is when you are up close, right in her space with very little room for her to move. A lot of guys make the mistake of thinking standing close is proximity; it is not in a bar or club setting, that is just standing. With proximity it is feeling each others presence on a different level.


Dominance: By setting the frame early that it is you in charge, you demonstrate confidence. The kind of dominance you use in the beginning is to not ask but rather state things you are going to do. So ""do you want to go to the bar?"" becomes ""come on, we're going to the bar to pound shots"". You then take her hand and lead her and you do so without hesitation. It also means taking her hand when you want, being a little forceful in moving her around (a little, not shoving but allowing her to feel the pressure) and being comfortable making demands. Again with this it requires calibration. It is not you ordering her like a drill sergeant but rather taking her in a loving way, you are making the decisions and carrying that burden.

Being congruent with taking a dominant role requires that you have rock solid confidence or can at least project that. So avoid darting eyes and any kind of fidgety behavior.
Final note on dominance; it should run through the whole interaction with you taking the lead but very physical dominance should come in spikes.



, They do, they just do not verbalize it the way that men do, or make it so obvious. They rarely chase so it can be very easy to fall into the trap of thinking almost all girls want just a tiny handful of guys because they never openly admit to liking anyone else. By that same token it is very easy to lump yourself in with the majority of the guys that leaves out.

It should go without saying that it is not true. You do not really even need to be particularly good at meeting women to get a date with most girls, you just need the confidence to talk to them. Girls are just like guys in that they can be attracted to you with the smallest of cues. Where men differ is that they typically go on looks while girls go on sub communications. If you walk around a venue with ease and with the kind of body language described above, exuding confidence as you go, women will be drawn to you.


Don't get attached to an outcome. Look only to have fun. This means not worrying too much about where you are in the triad model (Love Systems speak for the blueprint of a successful interaction), or trying to find opportunities to show her how cool you are, or throw in a particular routine you have had memorized all night.

The easiest way to be outcome independent is to have an abundance mindset. Unfortunately, getting to that point requires being good at meeting women and if you were there you probably would not be reading this. Instead, you can fake it until you make it. Act as though you have many beautiful women in your life, think that way, even try to convince yourself. At least understand that what this one girl, who does not know you, thinks of you means nothing. Also, remember that women are not rejecting you, they are rejecting your skill set if you fail. A skill set which you are working on and with practice will get better at. So do not berate yourself or get caught up in destructive negative thought patterns that you allow to define and rule you.


Know that it is perfectly normal to want and have sex. It is not a big deal and it is not a prize to be won. This is huge. The kind of guy who can define their view on sex by the words in this song probably gets very little.

Adopting a mindset in which you believe that girls wanting to have sex with you is perfectly normal is difficult but not impossible. Again, it's another fake it until you make it belief.
Also, realizing that girls want to and will sleep with a guy the same night they meet allows you to radiate confidence and a lack of judgement. So many guys, particularly ones who have very options in life when it comes to dating (aka most guys), believe that if a girl sleeps with you the same night or on a first or second date (in other words doesn't make you jump through a massive bunch of hoops) then she is clearly someone of low standards. This is not true at all. If the only girls you have ever ""pulled"" (for want of a better term) have been very easy girls, the kind that have little in the way of standards, then it is easy to see how it would seem logical to draw this conclusion.
The truth is that some girls will have sex with the right guy shortly after meeting them (there are of course exceptions to this). It is just that simple! Whilst it may seem like they have a lot of choice, and in a way they do (any girl, even the fattest ugliest women, could realistically get more sex than any guy by just asking for it), women who do not screen potential sexual partners are deemed careless, are at risk of harm, pregnancy, cervical cancer, STD's and lose social status. They are also often judged negatively by the very guys they have sex with which adds an extra element of risk, and in the past will likely have been dumped shortly after having sex. Because of these, and some other factors (including ending up with a guy who rings ten times a day and cannot accept it was just a one night stand), women do not just take whatever is offered.
Be the guy they can comfortably express their sexuality with, without judgment. Allow women to be free of the normal social constraints around you and they will thank you for it.


Women are your playmates, not your opponents. Ever wondered why it's so easy for some guys and yet every other guy struggles to pull? It is almost like a little secret women have with guys who ""get it"". Understand how the process works: the need for the ""bitch shield"" (the mechanism by which girls will outright reject an approach), the problem with nice guys, the natural hatred towards the sleazy guy, the need to protect their reputation, logistics, the fear of negative judgment from the guys they meet, the need for plausible deniability and the requirement that as the man, it is up to you to make it happen. So with that being said, do not think of sex as a prize that women hand out when you have jumped through their hoops, just understand that there is a need for women to screen. As a guy who understands this, you share in the secret and can confidently pass the screening process.
Understand that they are expecting you to lead. On the same note, look for the absence of a red light rather than a green light. Not all girls are so forward as to actively indicate interest but this doesn't mean they are not into you. So keep moving forward, keep pushing boundaries and always be closing. Do not just go for the number, go for more. Attempt a kiss close; or if it's late, and you have been with her a little while, suggest leaving together.
Recognize their femininity. As a man you should want to hold her and protect her. Be the man that she can be the princess with and be taken care of. Let her be soft, gentle and vulnerable around you. This extreme polarity of your strong masculinity to their vulnerable femininity will be a key to success. When you a similar mindset, and you hold that belief to be true, then it becomes very easy to convey many of the attractive qualities without having to say a word. They will see it in your eyes and feel it in your presence.
Remember, practice is key. You have to get used to being out of your comfort zone to get good at meeting women and having a life of choice. This is referred to as the pendulum effect, go way beyond what works and then come back the other way until you find a balance. So go out and test the waters, practice all of it and push boundaries. Do not be afraid because of some perceived notion of negative consequence, typically the worst that will happen is that you get rejected in a slightly harsher than normal way but that is not so bad.

Your male friend can meet your needs of belonging and connection.
Your male friend may provide you the freedom to not talk about feelings as much as you might with your female friends. You may also give your male friend a safer space to share feelings if he wants to.

Self-confidence gives the impression that you are happy with yourself and do not need others to validate you.


Confidence is often communicated non-verbally. Stand up tall with your shoulders pulled back, don't slouch or bow your head. Speak slowly and clearly. Speaking too quickly can indicate a lack of authority. Speaking slowly adds gravitas to what you say, making people think what you have to say is important.;
, Catching his eye for just a few seconds is a great way to signal that you are interested in him.The key is to spark his curiosity without giving too much away.


Remember to keep it subtle, staring at someone is not mysterious.
The eyes are the most expressive part of the face.Be aware of the micro-expressions you make with your eyes, including sarcastic eye-rolling or scrunching up your eyes in disgust. Keep these to a minimum and you will appear mysterious and unreadable.

, Maintain neutral, relaxed body language where possible. The goal is not to be completely expressionless and aloof, but to appear calm and self-possessed so that you leave people wanting to know more about your hidden depths.


Arms and hands are important. Avoid fidgeting with your hands, which can convey anxiety, instead place them in a neutral, comfortable position.
For example, if you are sitting, gently hold your hands in your lap. If standing, let your hands rest comfortably at your side.Don't be completely closed off, you will appear aloof rather than invitingly mysterious. For example, folding your arms, crossing your legs and turning your torso away from someone indicates that do not want to engage with them., A key way to create mystery is to hold back a little when it comes to social events. Try to strike a balance between creating meaningful relationships and being present, but avoiding becoming so familiar that your presence is appreciated less.Accept invitations when you want to, so that people can get to know you and enjoy your presence, but say no to a few as well. Give him a chance to miss you.
Leave a party early. Be as fun as possible while you are there but leave early. Make it seem as if you have somewhere important to be, but don't reveal the details.Don't document everything on social media. Social media can be a fun and a great way to interact with people, but keeping certain things private will create a sense of mystery about you.

, When talking, don't give an excess of details or go off on a lengthy diversion. The trick to appearing mysterious is to give them just enough information that they want to know more!


Give short, direct answers to questions but do not offer much detail. For example, when someone asks, ""Are you from around here?"" Answer simply, ""No, I'm not.""
Answer in a friendly tone to intrigue them and invite more questions rather than appearing rude and abrupt.

, People generally enjoy talking about themselves and feeling like the other person is truly listening to them.This is a great way to get to know him while maintaining your own aura of mystery.

, A certain amount of unpredictability is a fantastic way to cultivate mystery. Although being unpredictable can be negative at times, for example, if you are unreliable or flaky; spontaneous people, who are unpredictable in a positive way, are often intriguing and alluring.


Start a dance party at an unlikely moment. It might feel silly at first but the more you do it the more comfortable you will feel.Go to a restaurant and order the craziest thing on the menu.
Encourage others to join you in your spontaneous actions. Perhaps you will have a positive effect on them. At least they won't be bored!

, Getting to know someone gives you an awareness of their habits and routines. While there is comfort in this, after a while it can make them appear boring and familiar, which is the opposite of mysterious. Mix it up every once in a while to keep him guessing about you.


Suggest an activity he wouldn't think you'd enjoy. If you always appear professional and corporate, suggest rock climbing or go-karting. Show your playful side.

, This is particularly effective if you have been holding back and appearing mysterious in other forms of communication. A well-timed, witty aside shows people you have a sense of humor and they'll want to know more!


Try to see the humor in unfortunate or absurd situations. Don't be offensive.
Recognize that laughing is often a good way to deal with uncomfortable emotions., When we settle into relationships, often we become comfortable and establish a routine. This is part of a healthy relationship, but sometimes the mystery can slip away and you don't feel that sense of excitement we once did. There are benefits to stepping outside your comfort zone every once in a while, you'll cultivate mystery in your relationship and re-ignite that spark of curiosity.


For example, turn off the TV and go out on a date. Pick something new that neither of you have tried before.
Start a new hobby, find something that you both enjoy.

, Catch your partner off guard by doing something unexpected for them. Mix up the typical roles in your relationship.


For example, if your partner has always asked you to go to drawing classes with them but you've always said no, say yes!
Buy them a gift for no reason. You don't have to spend money, you can make something for them.

, The key is to balance feeling comfortable, secure and familiar with someone, whilst also keeping a sense of novelty and mystery in your relationship.


For some people, keeping bodily functions and bathroom matters private is important. Consider how you feel about this, every relationship is different., Relationship experts agree that it is healthy for a relationship and helps maintain that vital sense of mystery.Remember that you are two separate people with different interests and you don't need to do everything together.

Play a game.",How to Be Attractive to Women2," If a woman feels comfortable in your presence, she's more likely to find you attractive and be interested in you romantically. Be respectful of a woman's body and her choices.


The way a woman treats her body is her business. Try not to comment on her eating habits, her fitness habits, and choices she makes regarding her wardrobe, make-up, piercings, or tattoos. Feeling controlled or judged is a big turn off for women.
Do not pass judgments on a woman based on her sex life. A woman's sexual past and history should not be of her concern. There is often a double standard when it comes to judging a woman's sex life versus a man's sex life. Women are judged more harshly for promiscuity than men. If a woman feels you are judging her, she won't feel comfortable around you and is unlikely to find you attractive.

, Women like to feel like their presence is valued. Being a good listener can make a woman feel more attracted to you.


Maintain eye contact when a woman talks. Use non-verbal signals to show that you are listening. Nod and smile when appropriate.
Ask questions about what she's saying to convey you're paying attention. Ask for clarification on her feelings or elaboration on the details of a story.Try to remember bits of past conversations. If she's mentioned a friend of hers, ask about that friend. If she's talked about an issue with a family member, check in to see if it was resolved., Many women find the ability to tell interesting stories attractive. Try to work amusing or insightful anecdotes into any given conversation. Remember, elements of a good story include conflict, tension, humor, and drama.


Try to frame experiences in a story-like fashion. Strive for a beginning, a middle, and end. Build tension in between by using suspense and foreshadowing.You can find radio shows online, like This American Life, that feature storytelling as a key element. This might give you a good idea on how to tell an engaging story.

, While a lot of men believe women are attracted to the aloof of brooding, this is actually not true. Studies indicate women tend to be attracted to men who are open about their emotions. Vulnerability actually makes men appear more masculine and attractive to women. Try to be open about how you're feeling and why when interacting with women. This can make you appear more attractive., Women are often attracted to men who are good conversationalists. While listening can make you more attractive to women, you should also work on making conversation as well.


Use the environment. If you're out at a club, restaurant, or bar with a woman use what's around you to make conversation. Pay attention to what a woman takes notice of and use this as fodder for talking. For example, if she glances at a painting on the wall of a restaurant, say something like, ""That's a really interesting print. I wonder who the artist is."" This is a great way to start a conversation.Current events are also great conversation starters. If you're going on a date, for example, you can use current events to combat lulls in conversation. Say something like, ""What do you think of the latest election data?"" You could also keep it light. Celebrity bad behavior is often a fun conversation topic. If you notice someone too drunk in public, make a humorous comparison between this person and whoever is gracing the headlines this week due to substance abuse issues.Ask a woman for her opinion on a variety of matters. Women are attracted to people who they feel value their insight. Say something like, ""My friend Joe and I are having a disagreement on something and maybe you can help settle it. Do you think cell phones help or hurt communication skills?"", Another fun way to keep women engaged with you is to play a game. If you're at a bar, play a game of tic tac toe or hangman on a napkin. If you've been dating for a bit, play a game of scrabble at your place. Games that involve insight, intelligence, and strategy can help you show off your better qualities. This can help you appear more attractive to a woman."

Be kind.,
Have passion.,
Be supportive.,
Indulge in romance.,
Be considerate of her needs.",How to Be Attractive to Women3," The halo effect describes a phenomenon where you unconsciously judge someone as a whole based on a single attribute. This is why more conventionally attractive people are perceived as being better at their jobs. However, the effect work in the opposite way as well. If you are a genuinely kind, attentive person, people will perceive you as more attractive. Being genuinely kind to those around you can help you appear more attractive to women., Women tend to be attracted to men who are passionately engaged with life. Be yourself around women and try to discuss subjects you're genuine interested in.


Many women feel that men who speak passionately are attractive. While you do not want to inadvertently dominate a conversation, do not feel shy about talking about your own interests. Do not be afraid your hobbies or passions are too weird or non-conventional. Women will be attracted to your genuine nature.Women are also attracted to deep, intelligent conversation. Do not be afraid to bring up intense subjects you feel passionate about, like politics, art, and literature., Women appreciate men who are supportive and understanding.

Be nice to a woman's friends. Female friendships are important. Be supportive of her fostering strong relationships with other women. Allow her to spend time with her girlfriends on occasion.

, Women are often attracted to men with a romantic side. The occasional romantic gesture, even something small and simple, can go a long way in getting a woman's attention. Bring her flowers on a random day. Light candles for dinner. Plan a fun date night. Send her a sweet text during the day that say something like, ""Hey, just wanted to let you know I think you're pretty."", Women tend to be more attracted to considerate men. Simply working on being more conscientious of those around you can help you be more attractive to women. It can also help you be a better person overall.


Being considerate involves a lot of small gestures that mean a lot. Pay attention to how a woman's feeling when you're out together. Offer to take her home if she doesn't seem like she's having a good time. Ask if she needs anything if you're headed to the bar.Ask how her day's going. If you know she had a dentist appointment at 3, text her at 4 with something like, ""Hey, how was your appointment?""You should also be considerate of those around you. Tip well at restaurants. Say please and thank you to waiters and bar staff. Be kind to any friends she introduces you to as well as her family.

Wear clothes you feel comfortable in.,
Do your make-up.,
Style your hair.,
Smell delicious.,
Be fit.",How to Be Irresistible to Men2," There's no denying it; what you wear is important -- it tells the world how you want to be seen.


Therefore, it's important to wear clothes that you feel comfortable in -- that express your personality while also making you feel attractive.
Men aren't solely interested in girls who get dolled up to the nines, wearing skin-tight dresses and teetering around in high heels -- although this isn't a bad thing either!
The right guy will be irresistibly attracted to a women who feels comfortable in her own skin, no matter what she's wearing -- a high-powered business suit or paint-splattered overalls.
However, it doesn't hurt to take pride in your appearance by wearing clothes that highlight your best assets -- whether that's your bright, green eyes, your petite waist or your curvaceous booty.

, Make-up is a fantastic tool for highlighting your best features, covering up blemishes and generally helping you to feel more confident about your appearance.


The right foundation can cover up a multitude of skin issues -- from acne and redness, to dark spots and under-eye circles. A little contouring can slim a round face, or elongate a short one. Some expertly applied mascara can open your eyes, making them look bigger and brighter. The list goes on.
Make-up shouldn't be plastered on like a mask -- it should be used to highlight your best features and camouflage the ones you're less proud off. And remember -- it's not the make-up itself that will make you more irresistible to men -- it's the confidence that wearing it gives you!
Of course, if you're not a regular make-up wearer and you feel perfectly happy going bare-faced, we're not telling you to do otherwise! Good for you!

, Beautiful, shiny, well-tended hair can be a big turn-on for guys, so it's important to give it adequate attention.


First and foremost, make an effort to have freshly-washed hair as often as possible. Can you imagine running into the guy of your dreams on a greasy hair day? Mortifying. If you lead a very busy lifestyle, try carrying a can of dry shampoo around in your handbag -- then you can give it a quick spritz in times of emergency.
Get your hair cut regularly, so it looks healthy and well-maintained rather than scraggly and unkempt. If you have color in your hair, don't wait too long between appointments -- you don't want your roots showing!
Experiment with different styles to find a look that works for you and highlights your best features. Could you rock a pixie cut? Or be an ombré-haired goddess? Ask your stylist for some ideas if you're unsure.

, Of course, you shouldn't just look good, you should try to appeal to as many of a man's senses as possible! That's why finding your signature scent and smelling irresistibly delicious is so important!


Obviously the first step to smelling great is taking care of personal hygiene. Find some nice smelling shower gel to use during your daily shower and rub on a matching lotion afterwards -- this will help the fragrance to last longer.
Choose a fragrance that matches both your personality and the time of year -- do you want light and fruity, warm and floral, or musky and rich? Don't make a snap decision when it comes to perfume, go to the store and test a sample. Wear it throughout the day to see how the scent develops. If you still like it by the end of the day, you can feel confident about your purchase.
Don't go overboard when it comes to application -- you don't want a guy to be overpowered by the scent. Apply just a small dab on each of your pulse points -- the inside of your wrists, behind your ears, in the crook of your elbows and on your inner thighs. Then he'll get an alluring whiff whenever you walk by!

, You don't need to be a size two to attract a guy, but you do need to take care of yourself and pay attention to your health.


Men are irresistibly attracted to confident women who feel happy and healthy in their own skin -- it's a fact.
So when you're pushing yourself to run that last mile or trying to convince yourself to order a salad instead of a pizza, think about your dream guy -- that should provide some motivation.
Try to find an activity that you enjoy, then the exercise benefits will just be an added bonus. Take up a dance class, do horse riding, learn how to surf -- anything that gets you excited and motivated. This will also give you something interesting to talk about when you're chatting to guys!
Remember that attracting a guy isn't the only or even the best reason to eat well and exercise (you should do it for you), but if that's what gets you motivated, so be it.

Smile a lot.,
Make eye contact.,
Be a good conversationalist.,
Break the touch barrier.,
Leave him wanting more.",How to Be Irresistible to Men3," Smiling is an essential part of good flirting. Studies have shown that smiling makes you more attractive to the opposite sex -- so what are you waiting for? Flash those pearly whites!



Smiling and laughing also makes you seem much more approachable to men. Which is good if you've been dying for that guy across the bar to come over and talk to you!
Smiling will also make you feel happier and more confident, two very important feeling when it comes to flirting.

, Making and holding eye contact is a classic flirting technique which is as effective now as it was hundreds of years ago!


There's something intimate about looking a person directly in the eyes, so making eye contact is a good way to communicate your interest without saying a word.
One trick that guys find particularly irresistible is to stare at the object of your interest until they catch you looking. Hold eye contact for a moment, then smile and look away (while blushing , if possible). He'll be hooked!

, No matter how beautiful you look, how good you smell or how bright your smile, you won't be able to hold a guy's attention for long if you can't hold your own in a conversation.


Ask lots of questions -- this gets the guy talking about himself and gives him a chance to show off, which men love. It also prevents you from talking about yourself too much, which can come off as self-centered.
When you're talking, try to drop the guy's name into the conversation as much as possible. As simple as it sounds, this is actually a big turn-on for guys and creates a sense of intimacy between you.
Try to find some common ground, whether it's a love of black and white movies or a passion for your local ice hockey team. This shows him that you're compatible with one another and will allow the conversation to flow more easily.

, If you've got a good conversation going with your man of interest, you can reel him in even further by breaking the touch barrier.


By making physical contact, you're signalling your interest while also setting his senses tingling and making him want you even more.
The contact can be very subtle -- a light touch on the arm or shoulder, an ""accidental"" brush of your hand against his, or a gentle lean against his shoulder.
If you're feeling really bold, you can be a little more forthcoming by pretending to fix his collar, tie or hair so you can brush your fingers against his neck or forehead. This also gives you an excuse to get a little closer to him, so take advantage by smiling and making eye contact as you make your move.

, One of the most important tricks when it comes to flirting is to always leave the guy wanting more. This makes you a little bit mysterious and unattainable and allows the guy to experience the thrill of the chase.


Don't wait until the conversation becomes awkward or boring, try to leave things on a high note. This will require some serious self-control, but the results will be worth it.
Take some initiative and give the guy your number before you leave.You can write it on a scrap of paper and slip it into his pocket, or you can grab his phone and enter it into your contacts. Men love forward-thinking women who are willing to go after what they want.
As you leave, lean in towards him as if for a kiss, but at the last minute turn your head and whisper ""I had a great time"" in his ear. With those words you'll have him wrapped around your little finger and he won't be able to resist calling you for a date!

, If a friend senses your discomfort, they'll often intervene.

, Politely tell them that you have somewhere else to get to or someone else you need to talk to.

, Have your arms folded and lean away from the person.

Build a wardrobe of great basics.,
Pay attention to how your clothes fit.,
Wear clothes that reflect your personality.,
Start your transition.,
Be aware of how you move around.,
Don't be afraid to be touchy.,
Be mindful of your body's posture.,
Make eye contact.,
Look rested and put-together.,
Be aware of your environment.,
Have a task at hand.,
Pay attention to the people around you.",How to Attract Girls Without Talking to Them," Remember: attraction isn't a conscious decision, but it can be triggered by the right visual cues. Paying attention to certain aspects of your wardrobe can go a long way when you're trying to catch a girl's attention. Keep the following things in mind, :


Focus on getting nice shirts and T-Shirts in preferably neutral colors (black, white, navy) without patterns.
If it's sweater season, get some nice crew or V-neck ones in neutral colors such as navy, white, or black.
Keep a nicer pair of shoes for special occasions, and more a casual sporty type for everyday use.
Update your look with cool jeans in darker washes. Those are so versatile that they can even be worn on dates.;
, This is crucial; even if you followed all of the steps above, if your clothes are too baggy or ill-fitting you might go un-noticed. So make sure to enlist the help of a friend, or a sales associate, to help you get a second opinion on what looks best for your body-type.


Dress shirts. When you turn your head, the collar shouldn't turn with it. If it does, it means the shirt is too tight. The seam of your shirt should hit you right at the shoulder bone. Remember: you don't want the shirt to fit so tightly that you can see every detail of your upper body, but you also shouldn't swim in it.
T-shirts. Here, too, the seam of your T-shirt should sit at your shoulder bone. Depending on your body type, you might go for a slim fit or regular fit.
Pants. You don't have to opt for a slim fit, but avoid pants with pleats. They are a bit outdated and give the appearance of extra pounds on your stomach.
Jeans. In general, stick to straight of slim fit jeans (even if you're hesitant at first) and avoid boot cut jeans.
Visit a few stores. If you're not already pretty comfortable with fashion, going to a few clothing stores can go a long way. You'll be able to get a feel for those trends you like and for those you don't.

, Making an effort to show you understand trends can leave a lasting impact. After all, many women do like fashion! At the same time, you should avoid piling on every fashion trend you see. Just make sure that however you update your wardrobe you still feel like it's you. Note: a gradual transition might work best for most .


Take a look at your current wardrobe and pick one or two aspects you feel comfortable changing right away.
Incorporate something that is very you. Are you a big 49ers fan? Adding some of their color-scheme to your wardrobe might make you feel more comfortable with the transition (yes, even if those colors aren't neutral).

, It can be quite unsettling, and even difficult, to change the way you've been dressing because it might have become part of your personality. Just remember, change can be exhilarating, too!


Just do it. Sometimes, overanalyzing our style and wardrobe can delay our progress. Instead, make a timeline for the various steps involved in the transformation.
Commit to changing your style. Verbalizing your decision to others can have a powerful impact on yourself and can drive you forward.
Get rid of any obstacles to your wardrobe change. Just laying out your clothes the night before eliminates excuses the next morning, e.g. I had no time to coordinate my look.

, Here's the deal: the way you move your body says a lot about how secure or insecure you are. Simply being aware of this can make your movements more appealing to a girl.


Walk slower than you normally would, and keep your movements controlled. Such actions indicate that you're comfortable with the world and yourself.
Take up some space. Lean back and stretch out your legs. Think of it as marking your territory.
Be aware of your tonality. Though it's technically speaking, it's a huge part of body language. Slow down your talking speed, and maintain steady volume.

, Slow down: we don't mean that you should be inappropriate. But not being afraid to express emotions physically can signal warmth and comfort. After all, attraction is an emotional response.


Pat a pal on the back.
Hug or shake a friend's hand to greet them.
Don't be afraid to stand a little closer to other people than you normally would.

, Nothing suggests insecurity more than slouchy shoulders and an inclined head. Think about doing the following actions to adjust your posture:


While sitting, pull your chest forward, and roll your shoulders back. Keep your head high.
Walk with your back straight, and your head up. Take measured steps, and roll your shoulders back.

, Don't be afraid to look around the room. You might catch her eye, in which case holding her glance for a second longer can establish a connection.


Keep your gaze on the horizon while walking. Doing so makes you appear more approachable and sociable.
Don't be afraid to be expressive through your eyes. Widening them in surprise, or narrowing them when you're skeptical, shows that you're engaged and paying attention.
Smile genuinely. If you're feeling extra confident, you could try a cocky smile.

, If you're tired or had long night, it will show the next day. Take pre-cautions to always look fresh and rested, and make sure you look, well, clean .


Be sure your eyes are clear and white. Use eyedrops to get rid of the redness. Your eyes will look more awake and clear within seconds.
Take care of your finger nails. Keep them short and clean.
If your hair is buzzed, you might not have to do anything. But if it's longer, make sure it looks styled and clean.
Take care not to go overboard with cologne. Some women might not like cologne at all, or they could be very sensitive to strong scents.

, Different locations will require different attire. Especially if you've got your eye on someone. How you dress when you're going to a club should be very different than if you're going to the library. Let's take a look.


If you're going to a club, stand out by dressing in a more casual way. Every other guy there will probably be very dressed up. If you're not, you'll automatically project ease.

Note: we're not suggesting you wear your ratty gym shorts. Think a cool pair of jeans and a nice T-Shirt.


If you're going the library, chances are every guy there will be in their ratty gym shorts. This is a great opportunity to go in looking put together.

, Showing that you're a focused guy can be a very attractive trait as it signals commitment. Plus, it gives her the opportunity to observe your mannerisms from a safe distance .


If you're in the right environment, and you play an instrument, do it! What girl doesn't love a musician.
Going to a coffee shop? Bring a nice briefcase with your laptop in it, and dress business casual. Signaling that you're there to get work done can come across as determined and focused.

, Whatever environment you're in, if you're talking to people make sure you're active in the interaction. It's not just polite to them, but will also signal that you're capable of paying attention to the people in your life.


Use head-nodding to confirm you're hearing what the people in your group are saying.
Periodically shift your center of focus by looking around to the other people in the group.
Don't take out your phone while someone is speaking. This signals disinterest and rudeness.

If she catches you stealing quick glances at her, it will demonstrate to her that she has caught your attention and you are interested in her.


If you repeatedly make eye contact with someone, it could be a sign that she wants you to approach her. Three glances from a girl might signal that she's interested.Eye contact activates our brain's reward center, making eye contact a powerful tool for attracting someone.;
, A friendly smile is a great way to show someone that you're interested in them. If she returns the smile, that's a sign that she might be interested in you. Once you've exchanged a few glances and a smile, try approaching her to say hi and ask her about her about what she’s doing: “Hi, I couldn’t help but notice you over here. What are you studying/reading/up to?”

, While reading another person's body language is not an exact science, there are definitely a few behaviors to look for that will signal that the person is interested in engaging in conversation. If she is facing her body toward you or leaning toward you, that could mean that she would feel comfortable with you approaching her.If she makes eye contact or smiles at you, it could be a sign that she's interested in you approaching her!

, If a girl does not want to be approached, she will generally demonstrate this through closed-off signals. A few indicators generally include facing away from you, crossed arms, listening to music, reading a book, frowning, or pointedly looking away from you. While not perfect indicators, expressions and body language like this most likely means that you should leave her alone. Be respectful and let it go if she isn’t responding to you with positive, open body language., There are several ways to strike up a conversation. For example, you could ask her if she made her earrings/dress/other cool item. You could even say something like ""I couldn't help but noticing how your dress matches your eyes. It's a great color."" Don’t be shy about commenting on something that is eye-catching and/or quirky but avoid teasing or poking fun at her the first time you speak to her.


If you're in a place like a bookstore or comic book store, ask her what her favorite book is or what book she’s currently reading. You could also comment on the general atmosphere of the venue: “It’s pretty cool in here, isn’t it?” or “I can’t believe they painted the walls orange” to break the ice.
If she doesn't seem interested in talking, leave her alone. There are numerous ways to tell: not making eye contact, monosyllabic answers, looking around for some way out of the conversation.
If she is interested, she will make that clear through eye contact, smiling, and sometimes leaning closer to you.

, If she wants to talk or say something, give her your full attention and actively listen to what she says. Avoid playing on your phone or letting yourself be distracted by other things. This way she will know that you are interested in what she has to say and you'll find out more about her, have opportunities to further the conversation, and show her that you are interested in her as a person.


Ways to show that you are actively listening include maintaining eye contact, nodding, smiling, and agreeing with verbal cues such as “yes” or “mhmm.”, When approaching a girl, you don’t want to come off as if you are trying too hard. Act casual, but friendly. Try some light banter to break the ice. You will want to present yourself as if you are addressing a friend or acquaintance. If you are nervous, remember the saying “fake it until you make it” and pretend that you are confident and not nervous at all. , Think of something to say ahead of time before you approach her to prevent choking and being too nervous to speak to her. Practice what you will say a few times in your head or even out loud in private before speaking to her.


You could practice what you might say in your head. If you are alone or somewhere where you feel comfortable doing so - say, you excuse yourself to the restroom -, try saying it out loud in your normal speaking voice to familiarize yourself with the words, tone, and inflection you might use.
If you are not comfortable rehearsing out loud, try going over it in your head or writing it down numerous times until you feel comfortable with it.

, If she’s with friends, try talking to the group rather than just one girl. You could say something like, “I couldn’t help but notice that it looks like you are discussing something very funny; it must be the orange guy over there...” or something silly and/or sarcastic along those lines.Don’t fear approaching a group of girls. If you are confident, you will be admired for your confidence and courage.

, If she seems interested and you are still interested, try to make plans for a future meet-up. Give her your phone number or email address. This way she feels in control of the situation. You'll know for certain that she's interested if she follows up. If she says no, leave it. She doesn't owe you anything further, even if she did enjoy your company.


You could ask her for her number or give her yours. When giving out your number, you could try saying something that appears to be off-the-cuff and smooth by saying, “Hey, can I give you my number real quick before we go?” and then write it down or enter it into her phone (if she offers it). If you have a business card, you can simply hand that to her instead of writing out your contact information, though this is a more formal approach.

, If it’s during the day, before 5:00 p.m., suggest that the two of you grab coffee somewhere by saying, “do you want to grab a coffee?” If it’s 5:00 p.m. or later ask her out to dinner. You could say, “Are you interested in grabbing a bite to eat?” If she’s not available then, ask her if she has plans on the weekend: “Do you have plans this weekend? Would you be interested in going out with me?”


Always choose a public place for a date; you want her to feel comfortable. Have a place in mind if you do ask, or ask her if she knows of a good place.
If you discover through talking to her that you share an interest or hobby, you can suggest that you work on that interest/hobby together in a casual way. For example, you could say, “Some friends and I like to go out with our cameras and take photos of the skyline on the riverwalk on Saturday afternoons, would you like to join us sometime?” Inviting her to an event or activity that is public and involves others will make her feel more comfortable and take some of the pressure off of both of you.

, This is the most important part of approaching a girl in public or in any situation. Show respect by talking to her in a courteous way. Avoid swearing, making fun of her, commenting on her body inappropriately, and telling dirty jokes. Being respectful generally indicates that you are a good person that you can potentially be trusted. You can prove that you are trustworthy by being respectful to those around you, to your friends and family, and to her friends and family. If she is not interested, accept it gracefully and let it be.

Naturally, don’t be pushy or over-aggressive. Try to make a connection to whatever they’re looking at when you first speak to them.”I just recently finished that game, it was great; anything you’ve played that you’d recommend?”
”The best part about that game is the multiplayer, do you play online a lot?”
As with any stranger you start a conversation with in public, don’t harangue them; if they try to end the conversation or walk away, let them.;
, In massively-multiplayer online games, you come across hundreds of thousands of people. Hopefully some of them you enjoyed your time with enough that you've sought them out again and again. Get to know other players well through private or direct messages. Try to move your conversations from game-related matters to real life concerns, to get a better understanding of whomever you've met.


Try to get whomever you enjoy spending time with on voice chat; this is sometimes the only to tell who is female, as character gender may not always mirror that of the player.
Note that this method may not find you women in your area; MMO games include people from all over the world. You may have to settle for a correspondence companionship in your search for a female gaming partner.
It may be worth seeking out games like Second Life which have an active dating sub-community within them. Other less popular games such as Luna Online or Lucent Heart have game mechanics dedicated to people seeking partners online., Anywhere large groups of like-minded people gather will be a good place to seek out a partner who shares your interests. Conventions also provide a lot of opportunity for ice-breakers. You can compliment a woman on her costume, or make conversation while waiting in line for a booth or event.


Conventions may be the most opportune places to meet like-minded women, as they’ll most likely be there because of their own interest, and they’re engaged in a large, public setting which makes anybody more open to conversation:

”That costume is incredible! How long did it take you to make?”
”The wait for this booth is insane, but I’m such a big fan of that it’s definitely worth it. What’s your favorite thing about ?”



, There's a variety of social media which connects people based on their interests. If you have a Facebook profile, you may already know of women who share your interest in video games based on their own profiles. There is also Meetup, an app and website which connects you with groups of people who have shared interests.


For Meetup, seek out groups of people who get together to play games, or do video game-related activities. When you're at your first Meetup, take your time to get know the women there. If there's any one you find especially engaging, ask her on a date before the event ends.
On Facebook, don't be afraid to shoot a private message to female Facebook friends who share you interests. Hopefully there's a game you might both play online that you can suggest; if not, try being a little forward and asking her out.

, Whether it’s something a little more flirty like Tinder or OKCupid, or something more serious like Match.com, online dating websites make the search for like-minded partners a little less difficult. For the most part, user-created profiles will answer many of your questions in advance.You’ll want to look for women who’ve listed video games as one of their interests or hobbies. Dating apps and sites also make the introduction a little easier; use whatever interface is at hand to let them know you’re interested.
Don't neglect their other attributes, either. Just because a woman shares your interests in video games doesn't make her a perfect match. Be sure to be comprehensive when looking around.

, The best place to begin will be the place you spend most of your time--at work or school. Hopefully you already know some about your female peers because of the time you spend around them. Keep your ears open around the workplace for mentions of video games in conversation.


If you are aware of any one woman who is interested in video games, don’t be afraid to engage them on the subject, but be sure to do it organically.
One easy conversation starter is to ask how their weekend was. Hopefully they may mention video games, but you can bring up your own favorites to try and inquire into their likes and dislikes.

, A little more nerve-racking if you’ve just met at a gaming store or convention, but don’t be afraid. It’s always better to be rejected than to never know what might’ve been. Though your first connection may have been over video games, try and make your first date simple and classic.


Dinner and a movie is a timeless date idea. Try to decide on a movie together beforehand, and be sure to see it before your meal. This way the movie is ample fodder for dinner conversation.
While it may seem logical to invite her over for video games, there’s still quite a bit of getting to know one another which should come first. Try not to focus your date conversation solely on video games.

, Provided your first date went well, you should hopefully know a little bit more about your potential girlfriend. If you both enjoy a game that can be played online with one another, suggest a time to do that as a fun pseudo-second date. Or suggest she visit you (or vice versa) to play a game you both like in person.Try to lose any bravado or hyper-competitiveness when playing; if you’re both playing to win don’t lose on purpose. Losing on purpose is at best unsportsmanlike, and at worst insulting.
Keep things light-hearted and fun, and remember to enjoy yourself. Though it may be difficult, do your best to relax and put down your guard in this situation--remember that this is someone you've sought to game with, so there's no reason to be nervous.

, Don’t make the mistake of going out of your way to meet a woman who likes video games, only to exclude her from the more “serious” endeavors of your gaming lifestyle. Be sure to provide her the benefit of the doubt (and time to catch up) for games she hasn't encountered before.If there is a game in which you’re heavily invested time-wise, like World of Warcraft or League of Legends, know that you’ll need to introduce your new romantic partner to this more “serious” world of yours.
At the very least you’ll need to offer. Plenty of women will be happy to give you your “serious” time with a game that matters a lot to you, provided you allowed them every opportunity to be a part of that world.

, Many men might make the assumption that their commitment to gaming is more intense, or more foundational than that of the woman they’re dating. This might lead to a relationship of two video game enthusiasts, but one where it’s one person choosing the games that both play.


Remember to take a back seat and allow yourself to be introduced to new games. Don’t be a pushover for the sake of agreement, however; some games you just won’t like. Be sure to extend to her the same courtesy you hope she extends to you in this situation.

, No relationship can survive on one mutual interest alone. It’s well and good to have video games be the centerpiece of an early relationship, but growth is aided by expanding your mutual horizons. Maybe you both enjoy rock climbing, or walks on the beach.More than anything, make sure this is a person who you’re happy to spend time with, regardless of being able to play video games together.

, For those who grew up gamers, it’s easy to a have a very singular (usually competitive) mindset about gaming. Work on chipping away at this mindset to have the very best of gaming experiences with your girlfriend.


Realize that you’re not gaming with her to kill time, but you’re gaming together as a chance to bond and spend quality time with one another. Make sure the focus when gaming is on your mutual enjoyment.

, Not everybody will like the same things in same way forever. While you may have met a woman who is fond of video games, her interests may fluctuate with time. Variety in what you do together plays a large role in most relationships.


Know what it is you’re hoping for out of a relationship with a fellow gamer, whether it is a girlfriend to play games with or a gamer friend who is also your romantic partner. Knowing your priorities will be key to a healthy relationship.

Keep your relationships confidential.,
Avoid dating or hook ups with people who are in your circle of friends.,
Consider a change of friends.,
Don't be overly flirtatious with every guy you meet, especially those who are already in a relationship.,
Don't be afraid to confront gossip.,
Be in a committed relationship.",How to Avoid Being Seen As Easy1," You may have had a tendency to tell stories about your past relationships and sexual encounters. Don't kiss and tell. Keep the intimacy between you and your partner. Discussing your relationships may give people the impression you are getting around. Talk about things other than sexual interests or details about your love life.


Imagine if someone were to talk about your intimate moments with strangers. Think about whether or not someone may feel uncomfortable or would like to keep matters of the bedroom private.;
, Even if you don't talk about your sex life, the other person might. If you want to keep your sex life private, you should date trustworthy characters or people your friends don't know.


Don't date your coworkers as you may break up and feel uncomfortable in the work place. They may also spread rumors to get back at you for their insecurity or loss.

, If your friends are also seen as easy or behave poorly, you may want to surround yourself with people who have less controversial reputations. Find people and befriend those you respect and admire. Surround yourself with positive people who want the best for you.

, Nothing is worse than having angry girlfriends spreading your business about. Be friendly and kind, and keep the flirting to single people who are looking for more than a one night stand.


Avoid initiating conversations with just the opposite gender. Wait to be approached by people, and play hard to get.
You do not have to be rude or mean to people. You can still be friendly in your interactions, but choose wisely.

, If you hear that someone is saying negative things about you or the things you've done, confront them. Ask them to stop, and let them know you're not that person anymore.


If they continue bothering you and being rude, take it to an authority like a teacher, counselor, or manager.

, Engage in sex only when you're in a committed relationship. Let your partner know of your intentions for the relationship, and be clear about how often or when you want to have sex. You'll know if they're committed if they don't have any conditions to be with you. Consider not being in any relationships at all. Try not to have sex for an extended length of time.
Don't appear needy or desperate in your relationships.

Give yourself some time to settle in and feel comfortable in your new home.Settling in first will give you the chance to explore your new city, and make your new home a relaxing place you can come back to. It will also ensure your place is suitable for bringing a date back to (if you want to) and that you have a comfortable place or two in mind to meet a potential date. Try the following.


Have everything moved in, and purchase all the small things to make your home complete.
Decorate how you want so that your home is a great representation of who you are.
Take time to find your new favorite local places (coffee shops, restaurants, etc.) and spend time there.;
, As you are getting settled into your new place, see if there are any social gatherings or events at your new place of living and go to them.If you are living in an apartment complex, see if there are any meet-your-neighbor events. If you have moved into a house, look for block parties or yard sales. Focus on making connections with people in the area first. You never know, you may meet someone to date, or you may meet a new friend that can introduce you to someone later on. Try the following.


Ask your leasing office for a resident events calendar.
Contact your local home owner's association to ask about community events.
Check out your local park district for community events.

, Enjoy getting to know your new city. While your settling in, it can be the perfect time to do all of the activities a tourist may do in this new city.Cities often have their own cultures, special events, or unique things to check out.Have fun exploring what your new city has to offer, you never know who you might meet while you're checking it out. Look for the following.


Cultural festivals.
Music concert series.
Sporting events.
Famous places or landmarks in the area.

, If it was for work, introduce yourself to your new co-workers. If you are attending school or college, talk to your classmates about the area. If your co-workers invite you to a happy hour, go. If classmates invite you to a study session at the student commons, check it out. You may not want to find someone to date in your workplace, but you can make some work friends (who might have single friends) and get good suggestions about places to visit.”Hi, I'm Alice. I just moved here.”
”I'm not from the area, but I have been trying to explore the city a bit. Do you have any suggestions for places I should go?”
”Where are the good spots around here for hanging out?”
”What are the must see places in this city?”

Understand if she says no.",How to Attract a Super Picky Girl," Casually seek out the mutual friends you have with the girl. Find a good time to ask them what she’s particular about in a partner. Presumably there’s a reason you have an impression that this girl is picky, so try to find out more about what you know. Does she only date guys who are into sports, for example?By finding out more about what she likes—or more likely, dislikes—you can put your best foot forward in trying to attract her. If you find out she likes really forward guys, for example, you could tailor your romantic approach to that style.
You could say to a friend. “I really like Crystal, but I’ve heard she’s really picky. Do you know more about that? What are her deal-breakers in a relationship?”;
, By understanding what kinds of hobbies or activities the girl is into, you can better understand her preferences. Take note of any after school clubs or sports she participates in. Pay attention to any cues about her interests based on what she wears and things she likes to talk about, too.


Most people find their own hobbies interesting. By finding activities you both have in common, she’ll find you more attractive.

, Some people are attracted to a very specific type of look or personality in a potential partner. Finding out more about her exes can provide important information about any patterns of attraction. Any information you can get about why past relationships ended is also valuable context.For example, if all her boyfriends have played tennis, you might want to at least research a bit about tennis before talking with her, as she likely finds it interesting. If she recently broke up with her last boyfriend because he spent too much time at practice, however, that tells you that tennis interests her but she requires someone who will put the relationship first.
If you don’t know anything about her exes, see if you can ask a few questions of a trusted friend to find out more. You might say, “Jane seems to love tennis players. I wonder why she broke up with Max, then?” They might be able to provide you with more information.

, These days, most people advertise their interests on social media, either through a filled-out profile on a public Facebook page or more subtly in their streams of photos. Take a look through her public photos to see how she likes to spend her time. By understanding what interests her and the places she likes to hang out, you can best tailor your romantic overtures.For example, if you see in her photos that she likes to white water raft a lot, you could mention a recent kayaking trip.

, If there’s a physical look the girl likes, you can dress a bit more like that, as long as it feels true to your authentic self. For example, if she likes punk guys, but that’s really not your style, you could try wearing a leather jacket you already feel comfortable in. Don’t change your entire look for someone, as that is unsustainable. Try to find a way to access what’s attractive to her while still feeling like you.

, Show genuine interest in her hobbies, and try to find points of commonality. Asking her thoughtful questions shows you’re willing to learn about the things that are important to her and are interested in getting to know her better.You could say, “I noticed you’re in pottery club. Have you made any cool pieces recently?” or “Your presentation about animals in assembly was really good. Do you have any pets?”

, Once you know what the picky girl values, you can pay her sincere compliments that are likely to be more meaningful to her. She’ll be more likely to notice you and appreciate you if you make her feel special.For example, if she is really into painting, you could say, “I saw your portrait in the art show. The colors were incredible,” or “Your art show painting reminded me of a Dali. How did you achieve that cool effect?”

, Picky girls are often looking for a reason to disqualify potential suitors rather than to give many chances to make a first impression. One of the most common mistakes people make when pursuing someone is to do so too aggressively, which can be off-putting. As you get to know the picky girl better, try to give her a little space. You can do this by taking a few days off between interactions.


Don’t pay her compliments or ask her questions every day, which might feel like too much.

, From your social media research, talking to mutual friends and talking to the picky girl herself, you’ve likely found out some things she likes to do. Ask her out with an activity you already know she enjoys. For example, if she is a foodie, you could invite her to a new restaurant. If she loves the outdoors, you could suggest a hike.You could say, “I know tennis is one of your favorite sports. Want to watch Wimbledon together this weekend?”

, After the date, don’t be too keen to schedule another outing even if you enjoyed yourself. It’s important to give relationships time to develop naturally and asking for too much too fast can be off-putting. Give it a week, and then suggest hanging out together again, if you feel you both had a good time.

, If the girl says no, understand and move on. She is picky, after all! You might have more luck taking what you’ve learned and trying to ask out someone who doesn’t have such a narrow idea of what they are looking for in a partner.

Create a sexy atmosphere.,
Have sexy reinforcements.,
Have a sexy home.",How to Arouse Girls1," If you create a sexy atmosphere, your girl will be turned on before your first kiss. You should make sure that the lighting, smell, and sounds in your crib are set for romance. Here's how to do it:


Have soft and sexy lighting. When you walk into your apartment, the lights should already be turned down low --just enough for your lady to see you, but not so brightly that she feels self-conscious. Light a few candles. If you don't have any candles, just have a few lights on that make the room dim.
Have a sexy-smelling apartment. If you know you'll be having a lady over on a particular night, open your windows during the day and let in some fresh air. Some manly potpourri can help your apartment stay fresh too. When your lady arrives, casually light some incense, or make sure those candles are scented. You can also use a nice scented air freshener.
Play sexy music. Your lady will be more turned on if you turn on the right music. Jazz can make her feel sophisticated, and R&B can put her in a sexy mood. Whatever you choose, make sure you're casual about putting it on, and play it softly.;
, Your home should be prepared for sexiness in advance, so the mood can stay hot and you can avoid interruptions. Here are a few key items to always have in stock:


Something to drink. Be prepared with red and white wine and any other beverages that your lady may like. Chances are that you've come back from drinking at a sexy dinner date, and to keep things going, you should always have something extra to sip on just in case.
Something to eat. If you need more time to warm up to get to the bedroom, sharing a sexy snack can help set the mood. Be prepared with sexy foods like grapes, strawberries, cheese and crackers, or chocolate. Avoid eating anything greasy or fried that can give you gas, which will definitely not be a turn on.
Something to clean up with. If you plan on doing the deed, have a clean towel and fresh soap for your girl, so you don't turn her off by giving her a wet, moldy towel.

, Work as hard as you can to have a home that will turn the ladies on immediately. Your home should be presentable so your girl wants to venture into the bedroom. Here's how:


Be clean. This is the most important part of setting the mood. Hide your dirty laundry, clean all surfaces in your home, and absolutely make sure you don't have a grimy bathroom. Your girl should be as comfortable as possible before she can be ready for action.
Be fashionable. Your home doesn't have to be worth a million dollars to turn a lady on. Have classy wooden or leather furniture, a few nice paintings, and a good stereo system to show your girl that you care about your surroundings. Avoid lots of photos of you and your ex-girlfriends.
Have a sexy bed. Clean your sheets and covers, have nice, fluffy pillows, and a clean night table. This is the time to put your pictures of you and your mom as far away as possible. Your girl should feel comfortable snuggling up in your covers to be ready for your body.

Start finding good guys.",How to Approach a Guy Anywhere," The best place to start if you want to begin talking with guys successfully is to just get better at talking to strangers. Talk to the clerk at the grocery store, strike up a conversation with the old lady in the park, talk to that guy in the sci-fi aisle at the book store....you get the idea. If you want to approach a guy in a way that comes across as normal, you have to do it the same way you'd approach anyone else, so practicing with normal people is the best way to get yourself prepared.;
, This is not to say that you have to look like a model, but you definitely shouldn't look like you just escaped the local insane asylum. Practice good hygiene and wear clean clothes that fit and flatter your body. You should also smell good for the same reason. Just shower and use deodorant. A little perfume can be nice, just don't overdo it.

, Don't just immediately rush over to a hot guy. Take a minute to look him over. You'll need to use what you see to make some guesses about what he might like to talk about and whether he'll be receptive. Look at their behavior and how they're interacting with the people around them. You should also look at what they're wearing. Wedding rings, no go. Items that look sentimental (like a hand knit hat), probably has a girlfriend. Do keep an eye out for things that can start a conversation though.

, Chatting up guys in some locations can be a bit off-putting. If he's clearly out with a business partner or boss, leave him alone. Public transportation is also a bad idea, since usually someone is tired or busy while taking public transit.

, Do talk to them where there are other people around though. This can not only give you an excuse to talk, but it removes the feeling like you might be after something.

, Try to catch him when he's alone, but also avoid using a wing woman/man. This makes you seem too much like those pickup artist guys. A wing buddy shows that you do this a lot or in a calculated way, which sends the absolute wrong message to a guy.

, When you're looking for an excuse to start a conversation with a guy, start with something that's going on around you. For example, you can comment on an event flier you see nearby (""Hey, do you live in this neighborhood? I see that there's a farmer's market but I've never been. Is it any good?""). You could also comment on another person, if you see someone doing something nice (""Did you see that? It's a shame you don't see that more often."").

, If you see that he's wearing something interesting, like a shirt with an event logo or university, you can ask him about it (""Have you actually gone to Burning Man? I've always want to go.""). You can also ask him about an item you see him holding, like a book (""Is that book any good? I'm looking to add to my reading list for this summer."").

, Look at what he's wearing. If he's wearing something nice, he's probably pretty proud of it and paying him a compliment will be a great way to grab his attention. Especially if he's wearing nice shoes. Watches, ties, and cuff links are also often sources of pride.

, Everyone likes to feel like they have a purpose, so help him feel like your hero in order to break the ice. Ask him if he'll help you reach something nearby. Ask him to hold your place in line while you grab something really quick (run and grab the nearest item around the corner). Ask him for directions. These can be great ways to start a conversation., Catch his eye and let him see you looking at him with a confused expression. Then, go up to him and say something like, ""I'm really sorry to bother you, but I'm sure we've met before. I can't remember where but...I didn't want to be rude and make you feel like I was ignoring you."" Then do a quick game of trying to figure out where you've met before. (Where do you work? Do you volunteer? etc...)

, Once you've broken that initial ice, it's a good idea to give a basic introduction. Just your first name will do. Anything more will seem overly personal.

, This is the classic move but it is best avoided. Asking a guy what he does for a living right off the bat (unless it is relevant to the conversation) gives him the impression that you're just a gold digger. Not the best way to start getting to know someone!

, It's no fun to have a conversation with someone who's obviously just interested in talking about themselves, so give him information about you but take every opportunity to turn the conversation back around to him. So, for example, if he asks you a question about yourself, ask the same in turn of him.

, When you ask him questions, try to shoot for a healthy helping of open ended questions. These are questions that cannot be answered with a basic yes or no answer, helping to keep the conversation moving in an interesting direction. Open ended questions usually start with words like ""why"" or ""how"". ""When"" and ""who"" questions aren't likely to get you a long answer.

, Ask him questions and try to tease out some things you have in common. It doesn't have to be much but it can help you bond and certainly keeps the conversation going. Ask him about his likes within the context of the conversation you're having. If his don't match up with yours, that's fine: just ask him why he feels the way he does with politeness and curiosity.

, If he seems off-put, just back off. You're not going to get anywhere. Look for a closed body posture or him slightly backing away from you. Listen for how he responds when you talk. Is he giving the shortest answer possible and trying to close the conversation? These are bad signs. But if he's moving closer, giving long answers, or flirting a bit, you're in the gold.

, If he seems open and responsive, however, you can give him your number! Don't give him a business card, in case he turns out to be a weirdo (you don't want him to show up at your office). Just a quick scribble on a spare piece of paper will do fine. We wish you the best of luck in your ventures!

, Confidence will not only make guys more attracted to you (and attract the right kind of guys!), it will also make it easier for you to approach guys in the first place. Gaining confidence isn't so hard! Give yourself the opportunity to do things you're proud of and embrace the idea that you don't need to be perfect.

, Flirting like a pro will make it way easier to make an impression and communicate your intentions to your Handsome Stranger. Just be careful not to be creepy!

, It can be hard to learn how to have fun, comfortable conversations with strangers, but you can learn with some help and some practice.

, You'll also want to get better at just talking to guys. While they can sometimes be a little harder to have a conversation with than a girl, it's mostly just about learning the right rhythms and what they like to talk about. You can do it!

, Being coy and hoping that he asks to see more of you will, more often than not, get you nowhere. Sometimes you just have to take the initiative! Don't feel bad: this only says good things about you to the right kind of guys.

, If meeting strangers only ends with you meeting guys who aren't actually all that great, you might want to consider trying to focus on finding good guys (rather than just attractive or interesting ones).

Recognize that you are being seen as easy.,
Change your focus.,
Be consistent and strong.,
Get a makeover.",How to Avoid Being Seen As Easy2," Consider why you are getting the negative attention from men and women. Is the attention stemming from comments you make, the way you look, or how you act around members of the opposite sex? Some may confuse sexual exploits with popularity or love. Sleeping with many people can be damaging to your reputation.


Ask the why behind your behavior and attitude. What caused you to be this way? What is causing others to see you as easy?
Use a journal to reflect on what's going on inside your mind. Write down what you're thinking and how you want to change.

, Make practical goals for yourself. Prioritize first things first. Ask yourself what is most important in your life. Choose to put yourself, your friends, and your family members before any sexual relationships. Do things that will make you happy. Optimistic people tend to live healthier lives.Focus on getting good grades in school or earning a promotion at work.
Try picking up a hobby like hiking, playing games, painting, or blogging.

, Know that it's okay to say no. You've already taken the first step in improving the way other people view you. Do not be a pushover and allow people to walk all over your thoughts and feelings.


If someone is asking you to do something you'll feel uncomfortable doing, respond that you don't have time or that you've made prior arrangements.If someone will not stop bothering you, avoid meeting or talking to that person completely.

, Look in the mirror, and ask yourself what you'd like to see. Do you want to be perceived as professional, classy, smart, or refined? Dress for the role or job you want, and consider the legacy you'd like to leave. Your clothes shouldn't be too tight, short, or revealing. It's not a crime to cover up. Wear whatever you're comfortable, confident, and feeling good about, but ensure that you're out to protect yourself from any future harmful behaviors.


Avoid wearing risque clothing such as fishnets, thigh-high boots, or things that promote sexual innuendos.

Make her feel comfortable.,
Touch her in sexy ways.,
Kiss with passion.,
Start taking off your clothes.",How to Arouse Girls2," Once you've set the right mood, you should begin to turn your girl on by making her feel at home. If she's relaxed, she's more likely to hook up. Here's how to do it:


Hang up her coat and have her take off her shoes. She'll feel more at ease once she does.
Offer her a drink. Don't force her to drink, but pour her a glass of wine if she wants one. If she's drinking, you should drink too so she doesn't feel self-conscious.
Compliment her. Make your woman feel good by letting her know how much you like her. Tell her how great she looks, what an amazing time you're having, or how much you love the way she laughs.

, When your lady is relaxed, she'll want you to come closer to her. Don't be shy! Get next to her and begin touching her in subtle ways to initiate foreplay. Here's how to do it:


Sit next to her and let your legs touch. Put your arm around her. If she's really into it, start playing with her hair.
If she's wearing dangly earrings, gently hold one in your hand and say how much you like it while your fingers brush against her earlobes.
Let your hands graze, and even hold her hand and caress her fingers if she wants you to.
Give her a sexy massage. Massage her shoulders, her lower back, or even her biceps. This will surely turn her on and help her let loose.

, Kissing is the first big move you'll make, and you have to get it right if you want to take your night to the next level. To be the perfect kisser, you need to find an irresistible kissing style. Here's how to do it:


Be gentle. Kiss her gently at first, without using too much tongue. Lightly graze your lips, and slowly touch the tip of your tongue to hers. If she's receptive, move your tongue deeper into her mouth, but take it slowly.
Leave her wanting more. Take breaks from kissing to lock eyes, brush back her hair, or to start kissing her gently on the nape of her neck or her shoulders. Don't just kiss without stopping for hours on end. She'll either get bored or will just be exhausted.
Be more aggressive with your touches. While you're kissing her, move your hands down her body to gently touch her waist, her breasts, or her inner thighs. Make sure she's comfortable with your new moves.

, Once your kissing is getting hot and heavy, it's time to start removing your clothes so you can get it on. To set the tone for hot sex, you have to take your clothes off in the right way. Here's how:


Take your girl's shirt off first. Gently put your hands under her shirt and slip it off over her head. If it's a button-down shirt, slowly unbutton it and throw it aside.
Next, take off your own shirt. Do not take off all of your clothes first. This may freak a girl out and will make her think you're being too aggressive. Take your time.
Once your shirts are off, continue kissing, but take off the girl's bra after a while. Note if the clasp is in the front or the back, and try to be smooth about taking it off. Don't be awkward and make jokes about how you haven't done this in a while, or how impossible it is to take off her bra. This will just turn her off and will make you look inexperienced.
Gently touch the girl over her underwear. This will make her want you to take off her skirt or pants. If she's wearing pants, slowly pull them down. If it's a skirt, slide it down over her legs.
Take off your pants, or wait for her to take them off if she's comfortable with it. Now that you're both down to your underwear, if you're both willing, it's time to start preparing for sex.

Be clear about having sex.,
Turn your girl on as much as you can before sex.,
Find your sexual style.,
Finish strong.,
Leave her wanting more.",How to Arouse Girls3," Though you may want to jump to conclusions once you're both in your underwear, it's important to make it clear that you'll be having sex so things aren't awkward and there are no misunderstandings. Here's how to move past that hurdle:


Say, ""Are you ready?"" or ""Do you want to?"" Make it clear that you want to take it to the next level.
If she agrees, be prepared with a condom. Be smooth about putting it on, and try to be as efficient as possible so you don't kill the mood.

, Men are often ready for sex before women, and even if you've had some great foreplay, you need to spend more time on your girl's body before you start getting it on. Here's what to do:


Caress and kiss her body--all over. Kiss her neck, her shoulders, her breasts, her belly, and the insides of her thighs.
Tell her how much you like her. Whisper a few lines about how sexy her body is, or how much you love a certain part of her.
Touch her genitals gently. You can tease her a little bit by touching her and then moving your hand somewhere else for a little while--this will leave her wanting more. Once she's ready for intercourse, you should go for it.

, There are dozens of ways to have great sex, and once you start, you need to feel out your woman to see what she's comfortable with and what she's into. Here's how to get a feel for your sexual style with your new partner:


Try different positions. Start by being on top and see if she likes being on top or even having sex in a more adventurous way. Don't try anything too crazy at first--get a good rhythm going before you get creative.
See if she likes to be gentle or aggressive. Try some light biting or some intense touches to see if she reciprocates. Some women like to be fun and aggressive but are waiting for you to make the move. But if she likes to be gentle, then take your time, and hold her lightly.
Try dirty talk. Dirty talk is not for everyone, but if your lady is into it, it can go a long way in turning her on. Tell her what you're doing to her, what you'd like to do to her, and compliment her body. If she doesn't reciprocate, tone it down.

, Both partners should feel satisfied after your time together, and before you finish, you should make sure your lady has a good time. Here are some ways to finish strong in the bedroom:


Remember that many women don't orgasm from sex, so if she doesn't orgasm, touch her until she does.
After you finish, don't immediately run out of the room or hop in the shower. Take some time to stay in bed and caress your lady and tell her how great it was.
Don't be disappointed. If your lady didn't reach her climax, or if you orgasm prematurely, don't be discouraged. This happens more often than you think, and handling it with calm will show her that you're confident in who you are.

, Once you've wrapped things up in the bedroom, there are a few things to do so your girl wants to sleep with you again, whether it's later that night, or later that week. Here's how to end things on a good note:


Offer to shower together to clean off. If she's game, kiss her gently while you're showering.
Don't be reserved after you have sex. You should give your lady some space, but show that you're the same funny, amazing guy she was making out with hours ago.
Tell her you had a great time and want to do it again soon. When she leaves, walk her out like a true gentleman. Put your coat on her, drive her home or call her a cab, and kiss her at the door.
Play it cool. Don't say, ""When can we hook up again?"" Instead, just tell her you had a great time and that you'll call her soon.
Make her think about hooking up with you. Once she's away, the occasional sexy text will remind her of the hot time she had in the bedroom. If you're smooth about these gentle reminders, she'll be wanting more faster than you can restock on your incense and candles.

Be true to yourself.,
Present yourself at your best.,
Use scent.,
Be a morale booster.,
Be aware of your body language.,
Don't be around all the time and stay the same confident person you are.,
Keep it fun.",How to Stay on His Mind," When you spend time around this guy, let him see and know the real you. There is nothing more alluring and memorable than a person who is confident, knows their own mind and has presence.
Obviously, this doesn't mean being self-absorbed, bossy or a poor listener; it does mean making it clear that you think for yourself, enjoy life and don't expect to be dependent on anyone.
Be considerate but also be forthright, charming and show that you're well-informed about the subjects you discuss together. Making it clear from the outset that you're no clingy type is truly sexy.


If this guy shows signs of preferring you to be other than who you are, it's not worth embedding yourself in his memory!;
, It doesn't matter what you decide to wear, whether it's casual, professional, evening or nightwear, just so long as it's neat, clean and suits your body shape as well as possible.
Any woman can look glamorous and beautiful, provided she heeds the simple rules of dressing to suit her appearance and figure rather than being swept away by current fads.
If it's a special occasion, splurge a little and wear something that you know really wows on you. Give him an image to remember!


Always be well groomed and keep your hair in good shape. A good haircut and a well-made up face can go a long way to creating a favorable first impression. Ensure that your clothes are ironed and clean too, as when they're not, they suggest that you can't be bothered with anything or anyone. That's not likely to make a lasting impression; at least not for a good reason!






Be charming. The inner glow is the part that will shine forth most in your well-presented self and it is charm that will be long remembered after your physical presence has departed the room.







, Scent evokes memories like nothing else can. It is scent that ensures that a person remembers events, people and places, even if unable to quite place the when, where and the who.
Of course, for it to be of benefit to you, he must be able to place the who and a signature scent can do this for you. But hold on! Don't overdo this aspect – a girl who reeks of perfume can be remembered for all the wrong reasons.
When aiming to use scent to provoke memory in your guy's mind, be aware of the following:


The scent must be one that works for you. Not all perfumes work well with each person and you need to learn which scents work best for you through trial and error. Moreover, they change as women age, so be sure to keep up-to-date By the time you meet the current Mr. Right, be sure to have this aspect well and truly sorted out.
If you are allergic to scent, or the man you're interested in is allergic to scents, skip this step entirely. Just be clean and have your natural scent. Your own body odor is very pleasant and attractive in a low subliminal way, especially at the middle of your monthly cycle while ovulating. If you track your body rhythms, you may want to schedule memorable dates for mid-cycle so that subliminal pheromone effect hits him hard in the instincts.
If you haven't had much luck with finding the ""right"" scent that sums up you, consider seeing a bespoke perfumer. This is a person who will ask you specific questions about your preferences and your lifestyle and will help you to choose the right notes to make up a perfume tailored just to you.
It costs a bit more but once you get this mix right, you'll easily be remembered by your own signature scent, which can be very hard for anyone else to match.

, Everyone loves hearing praise about themselves and how much they're valued. Of course, there is absolutely no need to overdo it or to gush thoughtlessly but expressing your genuine like of the great things you've spotted in this guy is a sure winner when it comes to being remembered.
It's fairly hard to dismiss someone who notices the best about you, so be sure to point out the finer points of this guy as you see them. You'll find this works well for life in general.



Be a good listener. Wait to hear all he has to say and don't interrupt. Use the opportunity to talk as an opportunity for him to tell you more about himself, not as one for your own stories.
For yourself, don't reveal too much too soon, as a sense of mystery will definitely leave you on his mind, wanting to know more.







Say his name throughout your conversation together. It will make him feel special and appreciated by you and it creates a link between both of you that is much more certain than if you just said ""hey, you"" or failed to mention him by name.







Be complimentary about his considerate nature, his caring ways, his thoughtfulness. You want more of this, so it never hurts to praise it!






Notice when he says or does things that mean a lot to you and remark upon them casually to show you're impressed. Repeat information he has shared with you at some point in your conversation to show that you took notice and found it worthy of remembering.






Be interested in what he's interested in and reflect this in what you say back to him. This is something that does get remembered because it matters to him and engages his attention.
For example, you may not know much about the sport he likes but reflecting his enthusiasm for a team win or a goal shows that you are at least capable of being interested.






Even when you disagree with his points of view, do so respectfully and also point out how you appreciate and acknowledge his viewpoint even where you differ.







, It has its own way of lingering in a person's mind, for better or for worse. Good eye contact can help you to connect, while mirroring his actions can create a sense of harmony between the two of you.
Mirroring is an excellent way to inveigle your way into his subconscious mind because it will cause him to think that you're attuned to one another, thereby creating a strengthening connection.
Be conscious of the power of gentle touch. Touch, like scent, can be a pathway to being remembered because it awakens a sense of warmth and friendliness. From the time we're infants, gentle touch is a form of lasting connection and care from others, and light, caring touch can invoke affectionate and trusting feelings in the recipient. Of course, don't overdo it or get too effusive and slap the poor guy!


More than anything else, wear your confidence and belief in your value with a warm smile. That warm smile will linger in his mind longer than anything else.

, Being elusive and busy will actually help to impress you upon his memory a lot more than being available the moment he texts or calls. In fact, leave gaps between instant communications methods to help increase the impression you've got a life to lead.
When you do respond, be kind and thoughtful but never come across as desperate, stalker-like or sloppy and disinterested. Never contact him when you're drunk or you risk saying things that won't be remembered for the right reasons!


Keep your interesting life's pursuits going regular as clockwork. Don't be bothered that he'd rather see you; let him know he can see you on the night you're actually free, for real. He'll be enthralled and as curious as can be...

, When getting to know a guy, keep things uncomplicated – if you want to make it more intense or complicated, then you're going to give him reason to erase you from memory pretty quickly. Keep your interactions fun, simple and enjoyable, especially while you're still unsure.
The deep and meaningful stuff comes later when it turns into something called engagement and marriage and that sure is a long way off, if at all... So keep it light and breezy, so that remembering you is easy!


Be sure to thank him for time spent together, just before you part. It's nice and it's thoughtful to show gratitude for a fun time spent together. Keep it simple, with something like ""Thank you for a really enjoyable day; I had fun."" He'll remember that you had fun with him, and you had the presence of mind to let him know it.

It's important that you feel confident and attractive when trying to gain the interest of a man. In other words, do not try to be something you're not. Be yourself and be upfront about your interests and passions.This goes for online dating as well. While a cute profile picture might get a man to click on your profile, he won't end up messaging you if you have generic information included in your ""About Me"" section. Let your personality show in your online dating presence as well.;
, When first meeting someone, most people assess them visually. If you're trying to seduce a man, make sure you dress in a flattering fashion to get his attention.


Remember, confidence is key. If you don't feel sexy, you won't appear that way to a man. If you're more comfortable in jeans and tees than dresses, try picking a flattering, sexy casual outfit rather than forcing yourself into a evening gown.If you're unsure how to dress in a flattering way, try asking a stylist at a department store to help you pick outfits that work for your figure or frame.

, When trying to get a man's interest, eye contact is important. Men often gauge sexual or romantic interest based on a woman's eyes and facial expression. Some studies propose this is because women are less likely to show interest with their bodies. Maintaining eye contact for the night can show a man you're interested., Do not be afraid to use your body to flirt. This can help a man see you are interested in him sexually.


Sit up straight and do not lower your chin. This makes you look confident about your body.Do not be afraid to use gentle, light touches. Touch his arm or shoulder. Place your hand on his knee. Tug at his hair., You should always find ways to flirt when first meeting a man. A little flirtation can go a long way in getting him interested.


If you're at a bar, offer to buy him a drink. Be nice to the bartender and respectful to any friends he's with. Try to engage with him by being flirtatious but also being yourself. Use your own unique sense of humor and perspective to impress him.Come up with an activity to do together. Challenge him to a game of pool or trivia and use this as a chance to chat him up and get to know him better., Men tend to prefer directness about sexual desire. If you're interested in getting physical with a man, try to work that into the opening conversation. Coyly suggest he might want to come back to your place. Ask him flirtatious questions about his body. Men respond sexually to blunt suggestions, so don't be shy about expressing what you want., When you're trying to get a man in the mood after initial introductions, try playing a game together. Go to a tennis court and play a round. Play a card or board game. Try competitive video games. Competition can spike testosterone levels in both men and women, leading to higher sexual arousal., Pomegranate juice has been shown to boost men's sex drives in a few studies. If you're interested in seducing a man, try offering him a cocktail using pomegranate juice. If he doesn't drink, offer him plain pomegranate juice as a beverage., If you're trying to set a romantic or sexual scene, consider a new hairstyle. Men might not notice right away that you've changed your hair, but they will notice you're looking more put together. This can be attractive.


Much like planning an outfit, pick something you feel good about rather than catering explicitly to a man's interests. While a guy might say he prefers long, layered hair, if you feel sexiest with a short bob that will be conveyed in how you act with your new style.Talk to a hair stylist about what style and color would be most flattering for you.

, Talk to one another about sexual fantasies. These do not have to be fantasies you intend to engage in, but just sharing secret desires can enhance both of your sex drives.


Talk about scenes from movies or television shows you found arousing. You can even try watching some of these films together to get you both in the mood.
A fun game to play can be ""Never Have I Ever,"" but a sexy version. In this game, you both take turns say something sexual you've never done but have always been curious about. This can be a fun predecessor to physical contact.

, If you're unsure how to initiate physical contact, try offering a massage. Massaging a man's scalp, back, shoulders, or feet can get him in the mood. It also sends the message that you're ready to get more physical., Men have erogenous zones at various parts of their bodies. These are areas that respond sexually when touched, kissed, licked, etc.


The earlobes and neck are areas of the body that, for both men and women, tend to respond sexually to being touched, licked, kissed, bit, and other forms of sexual play. Try focusing on these areas when you first start making out.The scalp is also a highly sexually charged area for men. Try offering a scalp massage and see if this gets him in the mood., Men respond well to visual stimuli. Try wearing lingerie. This can help get a man in the mood.


Once again, pick something you feel most confident in. If you don't feel sexy, you won't come off that way.
If you feel uncomfortable shopping for lingerie alone, take a friend with you. You can also purchase items online but the downside is you cannot try items on beforehand. If you purchase something online, make sure there is a return option.
Many lingerie stores have highly helpful staff who are trained to help people pick items out. While it may feel awkward, asking a staff member for help can be a great way to assure you pick something flattering that makes you feel confident., Women sometimes feel they should hold back sexually as not to scare a man off. However, many men are turned on when their girlfriends or wives take the lead sexually. Do not be afraid to be dominate in the situation. Initiate sexual contact. Try to have the man follow your lead sexually. Many men find this arousing and enjoy sex more with women who display sexual confidence."

It’s ok to treat yourself to a cookie here or there, but the healthier you eat, the more energy you have. This energy will support you to exude a confident sexiness when speaking to someone.

, Try something new, show spontaneity, and do so with a smile on your face. Even if it’s something entirely new, be confident in who you are while doing it. For example, join a new class—trying something new is a great way to show off your confidence.


Try something totally new. Vulnerability can be scary, but approach it with confidence and you’ll turn heads just as much as you would if you were an expert.

Know the occasion.,
Be yourself.,
Put the phone away.,
Know when to say goodnight.",How to Act Sexy2," Some dates are more formal than others. Be sure to show some more skin than you would in the work place and keep a giant smile. Staying confident will help win their heart.


Dressing for the occasion. Don’t wear a ball gown to go horseback riding and don’t wear a bikini to ice skate. Just because you look sexy, that will all go away if you can’t participate in the date. Be sure to dress for the date.
Don’t overdo it. Just because you’re going on a date, don’t be overly sexy. Too much make-up or clothes that are too revealing will have the opposite affect and make you look less than desirable. Stay comfortable so that you can show off your confidence instead of fidgeting in clothes that don’t fit. , There shouldn’t be any stress on a date. Be comfortable and confident in your skin, and you’ll become alluring.


Be comfortable in your body language. Interact with your date by offering to share foods or lending them a jacket if they’re cold.
If you’re trying to force yourself to be someone you aren’t, it comes off as confusing instead of confident. You can be quiet sexy, as long as you are sure of who you are.

, It’s tough nowadays but turning your phone off for a couple hours will go much further on a date than you could imagine.


Keeps you engaged. There is no need to spend more time on your phone than with your significant other. In order to turn the romance up, turn your cell phone off. Helps portray confidence. If you’re looking at your phone consistently instead of at your date, there’s a problem. They will feel underappreciated and unengaged. Looking at them instead shows that you’re confident and will help them feel at ease.

, All-nighters aren’t typically a good idea for a date. It makes it harder to focus and stay engaged. If you’re tired, it is ok to say so. Make a point to tell them if you had a good time and then leave. Make them miss you. Keep it classy. All the work you put in to have sex appeal throughout the date can be trashed in seconds if you don’t say goodbye. When something is sexually appealing, the chase is part of the fun, so say goodnight and go home.
Ensure your date that you had a good time. Even if the date wasn’t a home run, be sure to stay engaging all the way to the end.
Set a next date. If you had a good time, pick a day that works for you and ask them to meet you again. Being up front about it at the end of the date is much sexier than a next-day text.

Be powerful.,
Have a direction with your work.,
Use eye contact.,
Dress the part.,
Have a voice.",How to Act Sexy3," Power is sexy. If you have power, people are attracted to you. They admire it, and if possible try to get into bed with power. This is because it creates a way of owning power without having to take responsibility for it and most people crave this. Speak highly of yourself. Don’t downplay your accomplishments, jobs, or lifestyle. A touch of modesty will go a long way, but be sure to show self-assurance.

, Getting stuck in a dead-end job is bad for your morale, and worse for you sex life. You might not be in your dream job, location, or situation now, but show that you’re working toward it.


Getting stuck in a dead end job shows that you have no interest in your goals. Think more highly of yourself, gain confidence, and exude sex appeal. , Don’t stare, but keep eye contact because it shows confidence and comfort.


Direct eye contact doesn’t mean stare. If you catch yourself doing so, look away sheepishly. Have eye contact when words are being spoken but don’t scare someone off by eyeing them nonstop.
Even make eye contact as you walk through the room. Glance around and catch the gaze of your peers.

, To show your power at work, dress in a way that demands all eyes turn to you.


”Fit” is everything. If your work requires you to wear a suit, be sure to get one that fits. It should hug your body, but not squeeze it. All jackets should be able to button closed, and you should be able to sit easily in all of your skirts or pants. Keep it appropriate. The best way to access this is to look around at your peers. Notice what they’re wearing and keep it as covered as they do. Women, if your bra or panty line is showing at work, it is inappropriate. Men, if you can’t sit without getting a “plumber’s crack,” go get some new pants.
Throw in a pop of color. Although work environments are often filled with black and gray suits, if you like color, show it off! Keep the black suit but throw on a bright top. This will help get you noticed. Stick to one brightly colored piece, it can be overwhelming and unprofessional if you dress in a loud outfit.

, Having a voice will get you noticed. Whether you’re putting on a presentation, or simply getting involved in an office meeting, talk in a direct fashion.


Put yourself out there. An office meeting containing the entire staff is a great time to ask questions. Asking a question here puts you in the spotlight—if only for a moment—which makes coworkers notice you. Getting them to first notice you is more than half of the battle in appearing sexy.
Stay involved. Go to work parties. They might seem like a drag, but this is a great place to intermingle with coworkers. Portraying confidence outside of the workplace is only going to help you appear sexy. "

Be spontaneous.,
Show that you like to learn.,
Get to the gym.,
Make as many friends as you can.",How to Act Sexy4," Confidence is the backbone of being sexy and appealing. Have confidence in everything that you do. It shows a high level of self-esteem and demands a certain level of respect from onlookers.


Don’t be quiet. If you’re a quiet person, you don’t have to lose yourself and become an extreme extrovert. But don’t let being quiet dull your shine. Gain sex appeal by staying engaged in conversation, even if it’s only a couple words at a time.
Always dress for the occasion. Even if you’re running errands, put on an outfit that makes you feel great. The better you feel about yourself, the sexier you appear.

, Try something new, meet new people, and continue to grow. All of these experiences will teach you what you like and don’t like and make your more comfortable with yourself and that makes it easier to be confident.


Having sex appeal means you have a fun, delightful, delicious manner about yourself. Add some surprise into this and you’ll have ultimate irresistibility. , Knowledge is power; power is sexy. If you’re always staying engaged, you’re always going to be learning. The more you know, the more confident you’ll be—about yourself, your job, your hobbies, or anything else.


Always ask questions. This can get you noticed. Whether it’s in a work meeting, group outing, or new class, attention will be on you if you ask a question confidently.
Don’t get complacent. This stands for every aspect of your life. If you stop challenging yourself, you’ll stop growing. Someone continually moving forward with life attracts other people who are doing the same.

, Not only is working out going to make you look better, but it will make you feel better immediately. Even if you’re tired, working out will give you more energy, so get to the gym as often as you can.


Have a good body image. A good body image portrays confidence. You don’t have to be a model to be sexy. Know that your body is healthy, take care of it, and own it.
Endorphins keep you engaged. Endorphins are released when you exercise, they give you more energy and high energy is contagious. It helps your confidence stay up when you have the energy to constantly stay engaged in what you’re doing and who you’re talking to.

, Friends play an extraordinary role in your life. They help build your confidence, define your priorities, and support you. People are attracted to people who have a reputation for being friendly. You won’t always meet quality friends, but the more people you meet, the easier it will be to see who is compatible with your personality. Those that are compatible will help your confidence stay high (not to mention, they’ll speak highly of you) and help you look appealing.
They’ll keep you in check. If you’re stuck fishing for compliments, friends will let you know. On the other side of the spectrum, if you’re too confident and appearing egotistical, they’ll be sure to keep you grounded. If you have this in-between of self-realization, you’ll be comfortable in your skin and sexy as ever.
They help your success. Friendship helps sharpen your mind, which has shown to make you happier. They help you learn yourself better, inspire you, and keep your best interest in mind. All of these things lead to a more confident, healthy life. This portrays sexiness to everyone you run into. "

Get close to him.,
Make excuses to spend time alone with him.,
Flirt on social media.,
Return flirtatious gestures.,
Be yourself.",How to Act Around a Guy You Think Likes You1," If a guy is giving you signals, return them by getting a little snuggly on your end. Try to sit close to him at social events. When talking to him between classes or during lunch, stand a little closer to him than you normally would. This sends the signal you like him back and enjoy being near him., Solo time with your crush can help you assess if he likes you. It can also send the message you're interested in him as well. Try to find ways to get him alone so the two of you can have a chance to make your feelings clear.For example, text him something like, ""I'm really craving a burger. Want to run and get a snack after class?""

, Paying a guy you think likes you extra attention on social media can let him know you like him back. Try leaving comments on his pictures and posts on sites like Instagram and Facebook. Respond to his tweets on Twitter and re-tweet the ones you find interesting.Work in some mild flirtation with your comments. For example, ""Cute pic! Blue is a great color on you.""

, If he flirts with you, flirt back. Common flirting tactics include making eye contact, flashing a smile, flashing your eyebrows, and casual touching.If these gestures are coming your way, return them.


For example, if your crush brushes your arm, wait a few moments. Then, do something like tussle his hair or place your hand on his knee.

, Remember, if a guy already likes you, you don't need to change. Be your unique self around him and don't be afraid to let your inhibitions down. Feel free to get a little goofy or wild around him, as this is likely to endear you to him more.For example, if you're a fan of a certain musical artist that's a little obscure, don't be afraid to talk about this in front of the guy. If you like a unique type of movie, invite him to watch these movies with you.

Give her a unique compliment.,
Ask her questions about herself.,
Ask for her opinion.,
Take the time to really listen to her.,
Be a gentleman.,
Take an interest in her hobbies that she likes.,
Make eye contact to her.",How to Sweep a Girl off Her Feet1," If you want to make the girl feel special right away and get closer to sweeping her off her feet, then you have to make her see that you don't just see her as any ordinary person. Let her know that you think she's special by complimenting her when you see her. Remember not to say something that might creep her out. Tell her she has amazing hair, a quirky sense of humor, a fantastic laugh, or the most incredible sense of style you've ever seen.


Don't tell her she's beautiful or gorgeous quite yet. Though this is a nice compliment, if you tell her too early, she may feel like you're coming on too strong or being insincere.
In your very first or second conversation, try to sneak in a subtle compliment that makes her see that you really see her as an individual, not just as any other girl.
You can compliment aspects of her personality, too. Like strong sense of responsibility, strength of character, morals, etc.;
, Generally people love to talk about themselves when they are given the chance. If you want to make the girl feel special, and like you really care, then you have to ask her a few questions about her life and her ideas. Don't give her the third degree or make her feel like she's in an interview. Just asking some slightly personal but not intrusive questions can really make her see that you're interested. Here are some topics to ask about:


If she has any pets -- if she does, what breed or what kind of cat or dog does she have?
If she has siblings, what are their names, gender, what do they do etc.?
What her favorite movies, bands, books are?
What her hobbies are and what she likes about her hobbies?
What her job or classes are like for her?

, If you want the girl to feel special and like you really care about her, then you have to show that her opinions really matter to you. Ask her what she thinks about a variety of topics, from your new shoes to her taste in music. Don't ask any questions that could start a fight right away -- steer away from politics or any other sensitive topics. But asking what she thinks from time to time will make her see that you really care about her instead of just seeing her as a plaything.


If you take her out to a movie, ask her what she actually wants to see. When you walk out, you should ask her what she thought of the movie.
If you pick her up and are listening to music, ask, ""What CD's do you have in your car?""
If you're making a life decision and are close enough for her opinion to matter, don't make it without asking what she thinks first.

, This is different from nodding your head and saying, uh, yeah, every few minutes when she asks if you're listening. Pay attention to the little details, from what she really thinks of her friend, to her favorite types of sweaters. Sure, you may drift off from time to time, but you'll rack up major points the next time her friend Stephanie comes up or you find yourself sweater shopping together; if you mention something she previously said, she'll be really impressed that you care.


Really listening to her will also make her see that you're interested in her mind just as much as you care about her body.
Listening to her carefully can also help you get a sense of what she likes and doesn't like, so you can get her the perfect thoughtful gift when the time comes.

, If you want to sweep a girl off her feet, then you absolutely have to be a gentleman. You don't have to go over the top or try to do something that really doesn't fit with your personality, but if you want her to feel special, you have to make her feel like a lady. To be a gentleman, you have to treat the girl with respect, be kind and affectionate, and make her feel like all of your attention is on her, whether you're out at a fancy date or just grabbing coffee. Here are some other things you can do:


When you pick her up, don't just wait in your car and honk your horn. Get your butt out and knock on her door. When she does get in your car, open the door for her.
Open doors for her and pull out her chair for her. Always let her walk in front of you.
Ask her if she's comfortable from time to time. Is she too cold or too hot? Offer her your jacket or hang up her coat.
Always start off a date with a compliment to her. She made an effort, so tell her she looks beautiful, stunning, pretty, or both beautiful and stunning.

, This doesn't mean you should become obsessed with Power Yoga or trail her to the Farmer's Market every Saturday like a little dog for her. It does mean that you should show an interest in some of the things she loves to do, and to ask about her passion for them without being too intrusive. If she loves to write poems or paint, ask if you could see some of her verses and canvasses. If she's going to a book reading one night and asks if you'd like to come along, say yes.


This doesn't mean that you should start doing a whole bunch of things that seem completely boring to you. It does mean that you should show that you care about the girl's interests and that you'll support her as much as you can.

, Seriously. This is one of the most underrated tricks to making a girl feel really special and kind to you. When she's talking to you, look into her eyes. This may sound completely obvious, but you'd be surprised by the number of guys who barely look into a girl's eyes either because they're too shy, or too busy looking at their cell phones to really pay attention to their girl's eyes.


This doesn't mean you have to be creepy and gaze into the girl's eyes 100% of the time, but when she's talking to you and you're really listening, take a look into her eyes to show that you care about her.
Making eye contact will also make it easier for you to be really attuned to your girl's feelings. If you look away from her face, you may not see that she's really upset or agitated until it's way too late for you to do it.

It is ideal if the person is sitting across from you.Try to get an idea of how the person is feeling about you and feeling in general before initiating contact. If the person is smiling at you and acting flirtatiously, then it is probably okay to initiate contact with this person. If the person is not responsive to you in conversation, then it is not the best idea to play footsie with them.;
, Footsie is no fun if everyone knows what you're doing. It is best if you are at a table that has a long tablecloth. Make sure you can reach the other person's feet without tripping over the toes of unwanted spectators. Then, quietly slip one of your shoes off (using your other foot to slide the shoe off if necessary).It’s easier to play footsie if you’re wearing shoes that can be easily slipped off, like ballerina flats or loafers.

Make friends with women.",How to Find a Girlfriend1," Think about the things that you definitely want in a girlfriend. Perhaps you want to find someone who shares your religious views, or someone who definitely wants children. Identify your “must-haves” in a potential girlfriend.


Think about both major and minor criteria. Someone with the same life views as you is probably important. But you might also think about whether you want someone who will run marathons with you, or someone who will binge-watch TV with you, or someone who works in the same industry as you.
While you may want a girlfriend who you think is extremely physically attractive, avoid putting this at the top of your list. Your relationship should be based on something less superficial than good looks.;
, Chances are, you’re not going to meet anyone if you stay holed up in your house. Get out of your usual routines and hang out in public places where you might meet new people.Think about visiting these types of places frequently:


Grocery store
Bookstore or library
Coffee shop
Park
Hiking trail
Music shop

, If you’re having trouble finding potential women to date, you may need to try something new to open up your circle of acquaintances. Try a new hobby or join a club, such as skiing or hiking.


Try to have some level of interest in the activity. Don’t just pretend to like an activity because there are lots of girls doing it too. Otherwise, you will start off a potential relationship with falseness.
If you are in school, try taking a different type of class than what you normally take. Even if you don’t feel like you’re a creative person, you might take art or drama class. You can get to know this girl in one of her favorite classes.

, You may have a very particular idea about what kind of woman you’re attracted to. But there are all types of people with whom you can become very good friends and potentially romantic partners. Try not to judge a book by its cover.

, Many people are casually touchy with their friends. You may hug friends hello or goodbye or casually pat friends on the shoulder during conversation. If you think a guy likes you, refrain from engaging in these rituals with him. This can easily send the wrong message., It's normal to compliment your friends. However, you don't want to go overboard complimenting a guy you think likes you. This may make him think you're interested when you're not.For example, say he's wearing a shirt you like. Saying something like, ""You look nice today"" could come off as flirtatious.
Instead, find a less flirty comment. Say something like, ""Nice shirt!"" You could also forego commenting altogether, just to be safe.

, If the guy starts flirting with you, try your best to ignore it. Responding to flirtation could be read the wrong way. If the guy, say, grins at you from across the room, return his gaze with a curt nod rather than smiling back.


If a guy is persistently flirting with you in ways that make you feel uncomfortable, say something. For example, ""I really don't like you touching me all the time.""

Choose a good time and place to talk.,
Confess your feelings directly.,
Be honest, but kind, if you're not interested.,
Respond appropriately if he does not have feelings for you.",How to Act Around a Guy You Think Likes You3," When having a conversation about something delicate, like your feelings for someone, it's important you have the time and space to talk. Find a time when you're both free and there are no external limits on time. Pick a private area, like a quiet bench in a local park., If you're letting the guy know you like him, be direct. There's no sense in beating around the bush and dropping hints. Get directly to the point by saying something like, ""I have feelings for you. Sometimes, I get the sense you also have feelings for me. Am I right about that?"", If you're not interested, let the guy down easy. Tell him you appreciate his friendship, but you're not interested in him in a romantic sense. There's no need to be brutal, but you should make it clear a relationship is not happening.Say something that clearly indicates you don't feel the same way. For example, ""I'm not interested in you romantically.""
If you want to give a reason, that's okay, but be kind about it. For example, if you're not attracted to him, don't say, ""I'm not attracted to you."" Say something like, ""I just see you as friend.""

, If you misinterpreted a situation, this can be embarrassing. Whether the feelings were returned or not, it can be awkward if you thought someone had feelings for if they didn't. Make sure you have a plan to respond in this case.


Accept his response gracefully. In either scenario, you can say something like, ""Oh, I guess I misread the signs. Thanks for being honest with me.""
It's okay to be sad if you were rejected by someone you thought liked you. Take some time to vent to friends and do something nice for yourself, like go see a movie or order take out."

Show affection to her.,
Support her.,
Give her unexpected kisses.,
Make time for romance.,
Let her know that you're thinking about her when you're apart.,
Do little things for her.",How to Sweep a Girl off Her Feet2," Though you may think that your girl must know how you feel because you are shy to tell her from time to time, physical affection can go a long way in sweeping her off her feet. You don't have to have your arm around her all the time or hold her hand 24/7 , but you should give her a loving touch or gesture when you're together often enough to make her feel loved to you. Here are some things you can do:


If you're at the movies or walking around, hold her hand for at least a part of it -- if she wants you to hold her hand.
If you're on the couch together, don't forget to snuggle or cuddle with her to make her feel special and loved.
When taking photographs, you can put an arm around her to make her feel close to you for the photo
If you're talking and she's upset, put a hand on her knee, stroke her arm, or hold her hand to let her know you care about her.
When you greet her and kiss her, run your hands through her hair or touch the back of her head slightly but not too much.
Don't forget to touch her playfully. Picking her up, or just playfully swatting each other is a great way to show affection to each other.

, If you really want to make her feel loved, then you have to go beyond complimenting and touching her. You have to support her, whether it's by watching her soccer game or being there for her after the death of her grandmother or her mother. Love isn't always just fun and games and affection, and to really sweep her off her feet, you have to be part of the complete package and be there for her when she needs you with her.


If she's really into sports, be there to watch her games when you can, or at least don't forget to ask how it went for her sports games like baseball game,basketball game.
If she has a tough exam coming up, help her study, or support her by bringing her lunch or offering to do small favors for her while she studies for her exam.
If she's having a stressful week at work, take it easy on her. Help her relax by planning a stress-free night in and don't bring up any big questions right then and there.

, Sure, kissing her in the middle of a hot hook-up session will make her feel good, but it's the unexpected kisses that count the most. If you're just chatting in the middle of a date or having a nice stroll through a park, give her a kiss and say, ""I just had to kiss you right now. You look so pretty or beautiful right now."" That will really impress her and she will want to kiss you too.


And once you're kissing, make sure you give her a kiss every time you see her without making her feel neglected or a nobody.
Not every kiss has to be a full-on French kiss. A gentle kiss on the lips is a great way to show you care about her and to mix things up right away.

, If you really want your girl to feel loved, then you have to make sure to plan dates and to stick to them. If you want to sweep her off her feet, then you can't just be Casanova for the first three weeks and then tell her that ""Sunday is sports day"" until the end of time. Make sure you have a weekly date night, no matter how stressed and tired you both are, and you'll continue to make your girl feel loved and cared about.


Romance doesn't have to mean chocolate. It just means making time to show each other that you care about each other.

, If you want to make her feel loved, then you have to let her see that she's on your mind even if you're not together. Shoot her a text once a day to let her know you're thinking of her or about her,or send her an email from work with a link that made you think about her. Don't check in eight times a day unless you want to seem overbearing about it, but if you're started seriously dating, don't let a day go by without a quick phone call or a text.


Though it's important to let her see how much you care when you're together, it's equally important for her to see that she's on your mind when you're apart.

, Though the big, grand gestures, like life-sized teddy bears or a diamond necklace can show her that you really care about her, all of the little things can add up, too. Though it may not be as glamorous to pick up a few groceries for her when she's in a pinch, to fix the broken table leg in her living room, or to go to the vet with her when her kitty is sick, these are the things that will make her think that wow, you really must care about her.


Of course, she should do the little things for you, too. You don't have to become her errand boy to make her see that you really care about her.

Be spontaneous.,
Be adventurous.,
Charm her friends and family.,
Maintain your independence.,
Don't take her for granted.",How to Sweep a Girl off Her Feet3," Though having a routine, from date night to movie night, can help establish the patterns that make a relationship meaningful and healthy, that doesn't mean that a routine is always fun. Mix things up from time to time by being completely spontaneous. Make an effort to not do the expected and ordinary thing all the time, and the girl will love hanging out with you even more.


Take a random weekend trip to a place you've never been before. Try food from a country you've never even heard of. Do a cartwheel in the middle of the street.
And don't underestimate the spontaneous hug, kiss, or compliment.

, If you want to sweep a girl off her feet, then you have to bring adventure and excitement to her life. This doesn't mean you have to go sky diving or climb Mount Everest, but it does mean that you should go out of your way to keep things exciting, pushing each other out of your comfort zones, and doing the things that you never thought you would do. Whatever you do that feels new, it will keep the girl's adrenaline pumping, and will keep making her excited about the relationship.


This could mean running a marathon together, learning to scuba dive, or even learning a new language.
When a new task is presented, have the ""say yes"" mentality, instead of saying ""no"" and thinking of all the reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea.

, You may ask, ""What do her friends and family have to do with her?"" Well, the short answer is -- everything. While you can start off a steamy and exciting romance without ever meeting her friends and family, if you want to be in it for the long haul, then you have to make the effort to get to know her friends and to be polite and kind when it comes to meeting her family.


Even if you don't quite hit it off with her friends right away, give them a chance. If you stick with the girl, it's likely they'll be a part of your life forever.
Sure, family events aren't always the most fun, but don't complain about it. If you really care about her, then you have to really care about her family -- even if you'd rather be watching the big game than hanging out at her uncle's birthday party.

, Though you may not think that maintaining your independence has anything to do with sweeping a girl off her feet, the opposite is true. If you want her to feel like you really care about her and that you can take her breath away, then you have to show it by letting her be her own person, and by doing your own thing from time to time. She will be wowed that you're not possessive or jealous enough to want to be around all of the time, and she'll like you even more for it.


If you both have your separate friends and interests and have parts of your relationship that don't intersect, your relationship will be stronger when you do spend time together.

, Once you've swept the girl off her feet, you've gotta keep ""sweeping""'. You may be feeling like everything is going great and like there's no need to keep making your girl feel loved and special to her-- and you'd be dead wrong about it. You have to keep things fresh if you don't want the girl to lose interest. Bring her flowers, continue to compliment her every day, and find new activities that you can do together, like hiking or learning to cook to keep things excited and not boring.


If you already reached the ""I love you"" phase, make sure to say it at least once a day to keep showing that you care about her.

Catch the guy’s attention.,
Get caught looking at him for a second.,
Make the first move.,
Believe in your own theories for how to pick up men.",How to Pick Up Men2," Position yourself somewhere where you are near him, and look approachable. If you can get him to come over to you, all the better. Look for a seat where he can see you or a spot where you can stand or sit that is a little bit out of the way but still in his line of sight. Then if he is looking at you, you can tell that is what he is doing. Play with your hair, glance his direction, or talk to someone near him to get his attention.


Don’t go overboard with the hair touching or eye contact- that could make you seem desperate for his attention.

, Then find something that keeps you a little bit busy. You can look at your phone once in awhile, flip through a menu, or chat casually with someone near you, but don’t appear as though you are unavailable. And then make a point of returning his gaze when he looks over at you. Hold eye contact for a second or two longer than usual, blink softly, and then flash him a little smile and look away.This might prompt him to come over and say hello to you first.

, If he doesn’t approach you, that is fine. Don’t be afraid to take a chance- guys like girls who are willing to make the first move. You should walk up to him, initiate eye contact, and say a friendly ""Hello."" Then ask him a question, or give him a compliment. Don't be afraid to smile -- chances are, he is probably nervous too. Then, go ahead and introduce yourself.


You can keep the question simple and let the conversation go from there. For example, you could ask him, “What drink would you recommend here?”
Try complimenting him on his hair, facial features (e.g. eyes), or sense of style. For example, you could say something like, “Nice watch, I like your sense of style.” Keep it casual and understated, but make it clear that you are interested in him.

, Some guys like girls who are more subtle and aloof while others like the complete opposite. You are your own person on top of all of this, and you have strengths that you may be able to employ better using your own theories. If you have any impulses for how you should make your moves, go with your gut. Every environment is different and you will be the best judge of the situation. Once you have done it a couple of times, think about what has worked and hasn’t worked, and keep trying with your improved techniques.

Be playful and show your sense of humor to him.,
Flirt with him using your body language.,
Act open and genuinely interested in him.,
Act appropriately, and don’t get sloppy.,
End the conversation and ask for his number.",How to Pick Up Men3," Don’t act like you are strangers, instead, be friendly, warm and comfortable with him. Pretend like he is your friend and start a conversation casually. Guys like girls who seem relaxed and fun because it puts them at ease. Talk at your normal speed and tone that you use to talk to your friends. When you talk to your friends, listen to how you sound, and look for the kinds of gestures you make when you are talking naturally. Try to do the same thing around him.


Don’t be overly fascinated by everything that he says and keep your cool. Guys like girls who have their own thing going on. If you can stay engaged with him while showing that you are your own person, this confidence will attract him to you more. Try not to make eye contact where your eyes are really wide open while you are talking with him. This may make you appear desperate or clingy.
Because you are getting to know him for the first time, don’t worry about telling him everything about you in the first night. You want to concentrate on the fluency of the conversation and not the accuracy of everything you are saying. You want to tell him some interesting and cool things about you, but the main point of the conversation is to keep things between you lively and interesting.

, Find something in your environment that you can make a funny comment about. For example, if you have waited a long time for your drinks you can say something silly like, “So do you think we should just ditch this place?"" Simple remarks like this can keep the conversation light hearted, and that is good for picking up a guy. Guys find playfulness attractive in women, and it will give you something to bond over. This playfulness can help make the conversation low pressure for the guy.
Even if you don’t think of yourself as a funny person, you can still be playful by exaggerating in conversation.
Practice being funny with your friends, and make little humorous remarks on your environment or what is going on with you.

, Guys find it attractive when women touch their neck and hair while they talk. You can tilt your head to the side and make eye contact while you smile to show him you are interested. Women also flirt by positioning their bodies when they laugh so that they show off their best features. Another way to flirt and show your sexual interest is if you look at him with your upper eyelids partly lowered and smile, the classic Marilyn Monroe look. This look is particularly seductive to guys.As the night goes on, maintain your eye contact longer, stay close by his side, and let your hands touch if you are walking side by side.


If you want to break the initial touch barrier, you can lightly touch his forearm when you are talking.

, Use active listening in your conversation with him. Maintain eye contact, smile and nod along to the things he says. Then ask questions related to what he is saying, and paraphrase the important things to show him that you are interested in the things he is talking about. People like it when they feel like you really care about the things they say and think. At the same time, be transparent with your intentions if you are just looking for a fling, and let him know that before you go too far that you are interested in a casual hook-up. Keep your interests in others as well. Don’t become completely absorbed into him. Check in with your friends, and any people you were engaged with before.
Read what kind of guy he is. When you are actively listening, you can pick up on his vibes. Does he seem to like to lead the conversation or does he seem to like to listen? Depending on what kind of guy he is, you may want to let him talk more, or you can talk more.

, If you find yourself liking him a lot, don’t drink too much or become too excited by your conversation. You might regret some of the things you say or do if you don’t take a break and cool down. For example, if you find yourself laughing an unnatural amount or drinking too fast, leave for a bathroom break. Try to calm down by splashing water on your face, talking to yourself, or texting a friend.


You might want to make a clean break so as to not regret anything later. So make a plan for how much longer you want the conversation to go and how much more you can drink, and then stick to it.

, After you have made good connections with him by listening to him attentively, joking with him, and talking to him like a friend, leave the conversation before the conversation naturally wears out. Tell him positive things about your time talking, and then ask for his contact information. Say something like, “I really liked talking to you- can I have your number? I would love to keep talking more.”


Send him a text message in the next couple of days and see where it goes.
If he doesn’t want to keep talking, don’t worry. Making the first move and talking to a guy you like is good experience, and it will help your conversational and flirting skills so that you are even better the next time you chat with a guy you like.

, One important part of being funny is being playful. You can do this through light teasing or always looking for the fun or humorous angle in a situation. Leave the serious stuff for serious times and watch the object of your affection become closer to you.If you're feeling temporarily down, try and keep the negativity to yourself. You may also want to reschedule seeing your girl until you're feeling more upbeat. A lasting impression of you being down or negative is not the foot on which to start a meaningful relationship.You can be playful with your girl by teasing her nicely or tickling her if she is open to it.
Other ways you can be playful are by engaging her in lighthearted and spirited conversations.

, Whether humor comes naturally to you or not, you can always work on your comedic skills. By thinking of things or situations that are funny, you can work on developing your funny side, which may make a girl attracted to you.


Don't force being funny, which usually doesn’t work. Instead, try to see the humor in things, and use those situations as a takeoff for a joke or anecdote.For example, if you see a large dog dragging a lady down the street, you can talk about the dog taking the lady for a walk instead and build on the story from there.
Remember to be natural. Being funny can be innate, if you have enough confidence to let your humor shine through.
The more often that you practice making jokes, the more refined and second-nature they will be when you want to impress a girl.

Avoid telling any sexist, ethnic, or religious jokes or ones on topics that push the boundaries. This may help strengthen your relationship.Avoid making jokes about women, her friends, her family, or other female matters. Also try and avoid jokes about weight, appearance, or dress size.It doesn't matter how funny you may think an inappropriate humor is, there is a lot of room for a woman to misinterpret your joke. While it’s ok to tease, making personal jokes is dangerous ground.Nastiness may also have your girl wondering if you'll turn on her next.

, Don’t place any pressure on your girl or to laugh. Laughter should be spontaneous and arise from humorous situations. Trust your instincts on when to make your girl—and you—laugh.Trying to be funny when you don't feel funny, or when it just isn't clicking for you, may cause distress and can detract from the enjoyment of spending time with this girl. Remember to not try too hard!
Laughter can come easily if both of you are relaxed and enjoying each other's company., Respecting a girl's individuality and special qualities is an essential part of earning her trust. Trust makes it easy to enjoy one another's company, which in turn encourages her to laugh.Every girl has a different personality and sense of humor. Understand that what might make one girl laugh won't necessarily with another. Get to know her to help ensure that you can make her laugh.Make sure to not say anything she may find offensive. For example, saying “mmm, battered women sounds delicious,” probably won’t elicit laughs from most women. In addition, you don’t know if she or someone close to her past trauma related to such sensitive subjects.
If your girl doesn't seem to find anything funny, that's may be a sign that you may not be compatible. It could also mean that she's going through a rough patch and doesn't find much of anything happy. See how she reacts around other people. If she laughs at their jokes but doesn't find yours very humorous, move along.

, Listening intently to your significant other is an important part of creating humor. Good comedians usually observe the details of situations around them and from here reflect back by shining a light on an aspect that others might not have considered.


By listening carefully, you'll learn her cares, worries, and interests, all of which are important observations in making her laugh. This can give you material with which to play and keep conversation flowing.
Use the comedic callback, which is a reference to an event that took place earlier in another conversation or event.This may make her laugh and also strengthen your relationship by showing her that you pay attention to her.
For example, if you are crossing a stream and she tells you to be careful you can jokingly say “like you were the last time we were hiking and fell in the water?”

, Laughter is infectious and enjoying a humorous situation together can help cement your bond or make her more attracted to you. You can enjoy situations spontaneously or even put yourself in places that you know both of you can laugh openly.


Mimicking her sense of humor is one way to laugh together. If it's risqué, for example, use off-color humor, too. Keep it natural if you can: if your humor is naturally sunny and gentle, adopting a dark, sarcastic style could come across as forced.
Only follow her lead once you're sure of her style of humor. Forgive nervous silliness on her behalf if she seems unsure of how to react.
Ask about her favorite comedians, funny movies, or sitcoms. Watch or reference them when you are together to help stimulate a relaxed and funny atmosphere.

, If you have a close and intimate relationship, you can tickle a girl to elicit laughs. Tickling is a good way to break down both laughter and physical barriers. You can playfully ask her if she is ticklish and then try it out while smiling.For example, ask her if her feet are ticklish. Whatever her answer, ask if you can test this out. If she lets you, remove her footwear and start tickling her feet. You could then aim higher by tickling her sides her neck.
Give her the opportunity to tickle you back.
If she asks you to stop or seems uncomfortable, stop right away so that you don’t upset her.

, Fun activities can help invoke laughs. By doing something together that both of you like, you may create a humorous environment that can strengthen your bond.


Decide together on something fun and adventurous that you might like to do. You could ride a tandem bike or motorcycle, take a helicopter tour, go water sliding or visit a local theme park; or even just see a funny movie.
You can go alone or with a larger group. Making yourself stand out as funny in a crowd may make your girl feel greater attraction to you.

, When the two of you are not together, have a collection of funny material that you can send her. Whether by text or email, funny anecdotes, articles or videos can help strengthen your bond by giving you conversation pieces and reminding her that you are thinking of her.


Find a website that specializes in sweet pictures of animals doing funny things, such as kittens sitting in a shoe or piglets in boots. Send her some of the photos to make her laugh, which can be a great tactic if you know she is having a bad day.
Send her funny jokes about things you know will make her laugh. You can search online or write a joke you think she’ll like yourself.
Send her funny photos of yourself, from baby photos to more current snaps.
Share the links with her to funny sites that you enjoy.

While work presents many opportunities to communicate with girls, always be cautious when getting involved with a co-worker. If things go bad between the two of you, it could make for an awkward work environment.

Choose words that aren't too suggestive or flirtatious.,
Prefer open-ended questions to those with simple one-word answers.,
Mind your spelling and grammar.,
Avoid overtly-sexual humor.,
Don't blow up your love interest's phone.,
Make eye contact.,
Start an easy conversation.,
Know when to back off.",How to Flirt Without Being Annoying," Aim to be polite and respectful of the other person, showing that you're keen to get to know him or her better. For instance, you could use common references to start a conversation: instead of saying ""Hi, how are you,"" you could say it like Joey from Friends, ""How you doin'?"" This shows you have a sense of humor and are on the same wavelength as the other person;
, You want to keep the conversation going, and the best way to do that is to keep the other person talking. However, don't get too personal during your initial conversations. Doing so will make you appear creepy. Examples of suitable things to ask include:


""How was your day?""
""So, what are your favorite hobbies?""
""Where do you like to go on the weekends?""

, This isn't 2005 when you were texting your friends in the code designed for your flip-phone's numeric keypad. You probably have a smartphone now, or at least a slider with a full keyboard. Type out full words and use proper punctuation. Disregarding grammar and using chat-speak makes you look childish.


Another faux-pas is using too many emoticons. Use those smiley faces and winks sparingly.

, A little innuendo is fine and even desirable in some cases. However, draw the line at any joke that makes outright references to sexual acts, especially in the context of your love-interest.


Of course, racial and ethnic jokes are never okay.
Also, do we even have to say it? No nude pictures, please.

, If you haven't heard from your love-interest in a few minutes to a few hours, don't send him or her text after text asking if he or she received your message. Behavior such as this is a big red flag for someone who is desperate, has no life, or worse, is a creepy stalker waiting to happen. Not to mention, it is very annoying to the other person.

, Eye contact is very important in human-to-human interaction, but it has an added element when it comes to partner selection. When you meet your crush's eyes, you are demonstratingthat you're into him or her without being obvious about it. Here are some ways not to do it:


Avoid staring at the other person's body. It can be considered as ""sexing"", which isn't really comfortable for some people. A lingering glance is okay, though.
Avoid staring into the eyes without a break. That's plain creepy!

, It doesn't need to be long at first, and it definitely shouldn't be complicated or make your partner feel uncomfortable. Here are some tips:


Don't make ""you"" the main topic of conversation. Your partner will think that you're arrogant and just a bit boring.
Get him or her talking about him or herself. Not only will you learn about the other person, he or she will also enjoy the conversation and want to continue talking.
Avoid talking about personal or touchy things, especially money, faith, and politics. Money is a general turn-off (especially boasting or acting desperate) while beliefs can be navigated a little later on, when you're both feeling a little more certain about one another.

, Nothing is more annoying that having someone that you're not interested in keep pursuing you. Watch the other person's body language for clues on how he or she is feeling about you. Some signals are deliberate while others are done instinctively, almost without the other person knowing it.


If the person you're flirting with is a woman and she puts her pursebetween you and her or grips it tightly, she's sending you a signal that she's not interested in you.
Another signal is the direction of the body. If his or her body faces away from you, even if it's just the angle of his or her legs, it's time to move on.
He or she may also come right out and tell you that he or she is not interested. If this happens, then politely leave.

Open up the conversation.,
Send a flirty compliment.,
Try sending texts at night.,
Be yourself.,
Play up your fun side.,
Don't be afraid to tease.,
Give him a cute nickname.,
Break up the boredom.,
Let him know you're thinking about him.,
Keep the conversation going.,
Wait to get sexy.,
Skip the graphic pics altogether.",How to Flirt with a Guy over Text1," If you're trying to flirt with a guy who you're not romantic with yet, try to give him an opening to something romantic. That way, he'll get the idea, and if he's interested, try to steer the conversation that way.For instance, opening with ""I had a dream about you last night!"" is a subtle way to be flirtatious. It implies you maybe had a flirty or sexual dream about him, and if he takes it that way, you can get a more flirty conversation going.
If he ignores the subtext, you'll know he's probably not that interested.;
, Everyone likes to hear nice things about themselves, and compliments are a great way to flirt. If you're trying to start a flirty conversation, try including a flirty comment to help get the ball rolling.


For instance, if you're going out with someone on the basketball team, you could write, ""The gym sure heated up when you came on the court today!""
Be genuine and specific. You don't have to stick to looks, but make it something specific. For instance, instead of saying, ""You're cute,"" you could say, ""You have a beautiful smile.""

, Now, you probably don't want to start sending texts at 2 in the morning unless you know he's already up. Texting at night, though, can be more intimate and invite flirting.Something about the nighttime will invite you both to let loose a little. Try waiting until gets dark before you send a text.
You could write, ""I'm all snuggled up in my bed. What are you doing?""

, In a text, you may be tempted to present yourself as sillier, poutier, or more sexualized than you are in person. You really don't need to do that, especially since, if that's all he knows about you, he's going to expect a different person if you do meet.For example, you don't need to use a million exclamation marks to show how excited you are if you really aren't that excitable in real life.

, While you don't want to make yourself out to be something you're not, it is okay to play up your fun side in texts. Texting lends itself to shorter, lighter conversations, so bringing that side out will make him want to get to know you more.For instance, say you're spending the night home in your pajamas. Instead of texting about that, tell him about the fun night you had out last night, such as ""Went out and had fun with the girls last night, but I kept wishing you were there.""

, Teasing can help create intimacy, as long as the guy has a sense of humor. One thing you can tease him about is a mistake he let through on one of his texts, such as a goofy autocorrect.For instance, if he sends a text that says, ""I think your nets are sexy"" when he probably meant ""eyes,"" you can tease him about it. You could say, ""Oh, so you think my nets are sexy huh? What part of body is my nets?""

, Giving him a nickname may seem silly, but it does let him know that you like him. You stick to something more manly or go over the top with something cutesy and silly. Either way, try dropping it in a text to help him know how you feel.For instance, you could use ""hunk"" or ""Thor"" as more manly reference.
For something more cutesy, you could use ""sugar pie"" or ""babe.""

, Sending the same text every day at about the same time can get boring. Try breaking up your routine by sending texts at different times of day or by changing up the message so he'll stay interested.For instance, a friendly, ""Good morning, babe!"" is a nice way to say hello in the morning, but you wouldn't want to send that text every morning.
Change it up little with texts like, ""Wake up, sunshine!"" or ""Can't wait to see you at school!""

, If you see something that reminds you of him, snap a picture. Send it his way with a side note, telling him that the pic made you think about him, which will make him smile.Stick to pics of things he's interested in or inside you jokes you have.
Skip anything to serious, such as wedding rings or cakes.

, If you're texting back and forth, you need to hold up your end of the conversation. Just giving him one-word replies doesn't help out the conversation. Instead, contribute to what's being said, ask a question, or introduce a new topic if you have nothing to say.For instance, if he says, ""So, do you like movies?"" don't just say, ""yes."" Instead, give him room to keep going, by saying something like, ""Yes, especially when I'm seeing them with cuties like you! When are we going?""
Alternatively, ask him a question about himself, such as ""So what's your favorite type of food?""

, You may be tempted to start out with sexualized texts, but it's a good idea to wait a little while. In fact, it's probably a good idea to be in a relationship before you start sending sexy texts.Flirting is obviously fine, such as telling him you like his eyes.
What you may want to avoid is overtly sexual texts where you start talking about genitalia and trying to engage him in sexual chat. Of course, how you text is up to you, but you may catch him off guard by sending these kinds of texts up front.

, Even when you're in a relationship, consider skipping the sexy pics. Once those pictures are out in the world, you can't take them back, and you have no guarantee that the other person won't release them.While sending flirtatious pictures is fine, such as you blowing him a kiss, avoid anything that you wouldn't want your grandma to see if it got out on the internet--because it can get out and she could see it.

Don't be boring and predictable.,
Get personal.,
Pay her a compliment.,
Be mysterious.,
Tease her a little.,
Be suggestive.,
Keep your messages short and sweet.,
Send an equal number of messages.,
Be careful with spelling and grammar.,
Don't let the conversation drag on.,
Don't use text flirting instead of actual flirting.",How to Flirt with a Girl over Text," The worst text flirting crime you can commit is to be boring and predictable. Your text messages should be fun and interesting. If you can't think of anything fun or interesting to say, then you probably shouldn't text her at all.


For example, you shouldn't start a text conversation with messages as boring as ""Hey :)"" or ""How is your day going?"" Total snore fest. She probably gets those kinds of messages from every guy she meets, so do something to make yourself stand out.
Try something a little more unique, something which gives her an incentive to reply, like ""you totally cheated at football last night. I call for a rematch."";
, Text messages can feel a little impersonal at times, so do your best to make them as personal as possible, when you can. This will create more of a rapport between the two of you.


Use her name in a message -- girls get a real thrill from seeing their name in a message, there's something much more intimate about it.
Alternatively, you could use the special nickname you've christened her with, this makes it feel like the two of you are sharing an inside joke.
Use the terms ""us"" and ""we"" in your messages -- this creates a ""me and you against the world"" vibe that girls love.

, Try for example ""Wow, love your hair today, you look so gorgeous."" It's pretty simple -- girls like to be complimented, it makes them feel special and appreciated. So if you can work a few good compliments into your messages, go for it.


Try a classic (yet effective) compliment like ""I can't stop thinking about you in that black and blue dress"" or go for something a little more unconventional like ""you have the weirdest sense of humor -- but I like it.""
Make sure the compliment is genuine -- don't say something you don't mean just to get on her good side. Girls can smell a fake from a mile away.

, There's no harm in being somewhat mysterious in your text messages -- you want her to feel like she's chasing you, not the other way around, so try being a little vague or aloof at times, just not as much so she gets suspicious of your behavior.


If she asks you how your day was, for instance, you shouldn't write back a lengthy message chronicling every boring detail (see Step 1). Try something like ""It was pretty bizarre actually. People never cease to amaze me."" Hopefully, she'll be intrigued and press you for more details in her next message.
Or if she asks what your plans are for the weekend, don't be too forthcoming (unless you have genuinely exciting plans). Telling her you're probably just going to spend the weekend working on a paper you have due isn't going to interest her. Tell her you're off to slay a dragon or something equally outlandish -- it doesn't have to be true as long as it's interesting.

, Teasing is a great flirting method -- it creates a kind of intimacy between you without getting too serious.


As mentioned before, calling your girl by a cute nickname (one which is only used by you) is a good way to make fun of her without being offensive. Something like ""freckles"" or ""little miss perfect"" are good examples.
Tease her about something she said or did the last time you hung out together. For example, if she tells you she's grabbing a Coke you could say something like ""just don't squirt it out your nose like you did last time ;) "". This is an example of call-back humor, which draws attention to a time when the two of you had fun together, making her think positively about your relationship.
Just make sure you don't cross the line into being mean or offensive, or your texting relationship will die a quick death.

, Of course, no text flirting relationship would be complete without a little naughty suggestiveness to keep things interesting.


You could go down the classic route of asking her what she's wearing, or telling her something like ""I loved you in that dress, but I think I'd love what's beneath it even more"".
Another good technique is to take an innocent comment of hers and deliberately misinterpret it as something sexual. For instance, if she says something like ""I can't believe how long it is!"" (referring to a movie or something equally innocuous) you could reply with a simple ""that's what she said"".
If you're a little nervous about going down the sexting route, you could try casually mentioning that you just got out of the shower. This puts the ball in her court, if she responds in a sexually flirtatious way (like ""dang, I'd like to see that"") you'll know that she's open to it.

, Long text messages are boring and will make you seem over-eager.


Therefore, you should always try to keep your messages short and sweet -- no more than two or three sentences.
Try to make to make every message either funny, clever or sweet -- flirting should never involve small talk about the weather.

, There should be a certain amount of equality in every texting relationship -- one person should not be sending a substantially larger number of texts than the other.


Sending too many texts will make you seem over-eager and a little too available. She'll feel like you're coming on too strong -- which will either freak her out or cause her to lose interest.
Not sending enough texts, on the other hand, might make you seem disinterested or lead her to believe that you're texting multiple girls at once. If this is the case, she may decide to give you up as a lost cause.
Therefore you need to find a balance by sending a roughly equal number of text messages, with the balance tipped slightly in her direction if possible.
Also pay attention to who's initiating and ending each text conversation -- you want to alternate if possible.

, You want to give the impression of being witty and intelligent in your text messages, which can be very difficult if you're ""txtin lyk dis"". Teenagers may be able to get away with it, but anyone over the age of 18 should pay a little more attention to spelling and grammar.


You don't need to go looking up big words in the dictionary just to seem intelligent, just do a quick scan of every text before you send it to make sure there are no glaring typos or misspellings.
Punctuation can have a huge impact on how your text is interpreted. For example, if your girl sends you a picture of herself in a new outfit, ""wow!"" sounds a lot more enthusiastic than plain ""wow"", while ""I like it..."" is a lot more flirty and suggestive than ""I like it"".
Just don't overdo it on the exclamation points, questions marks, smiley faces, winky faces and other emoticons -- they can be very effective in the right context, but can seem juvenile if overused.

, One of the most important texting skills to learn is the ability to end a dying conversation.


If you let texting sessions drag on for too long, you will run out of interesting things to say and the conversation will quickly become awkward and boring.
The trick is to end the conversation before you reach that point, so you can always leave her wanting more.
Try to end with something cute and flirty like ""gotta go, babe, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Don't get into too much trouble without me!"" or ""Time for bed - need to get my beauty sleep. See you in your dreams!""

, Texting should only be used as a stop-gap flirting method between actual real-life flirting sessions.


While texting is great and all (and you can sometimes say things that you'd be embarrassed to say in person), nothing can beat the sparks that fly when you flirt in person.
Use your text sessions to organize a date or plan your next casual hang-out. This gives your texting a purpose and is something you can both look forward to.
Remember that things like prolonged eye contact, a dazzling smile and a well-timed brush of the arm beat a bunch of words on a screen any day.

Just have fun.",How to Date a Guy," Everyone deserves to show off their best features all the time. If you see your date everyday (i.e. work, school, the gym...etc) you can increase the man's interest by showing off your best features. If you look your best you will feel more comfortable and confident. Everyone should show off and flaunt their body type!


There are about five different body types: Hourglass, pear, apple, triangle and rectangle.
Each body type has their own best feature and you can dress to enhance yours!Hourglass: Curves. Wear blouses and dresses that enhance your voluptuous curves. Clothing should be tight around waist and form fitting below.
Pear: Shoulders and stomach. Wear tank tops and tight shirts to show off your thin stomach and awesome shoulders.
Apple: Legs. Dresses and skirts. Not too short though, you don't want to be too revealing!
Triangle: Legs.
Rectangle: Arms. Wear t-shirts and tanks.

;
, Keep him wanting more. Don't give too much away in small conversations before the date. Instead, answer his questions with something that could lead to a deeper conversation later.


For example: If he asks a question along the lines of ""What do you like to do for fun?"" answer with something vague, such as ""Well... I love adventures."" By leaving the answer open-ended he will want to continue asking these questions and get to know more about you.

, Dating will be a lot easier and more fun if you get to know his interests before the date. This will open up an endless amount of conversations for your date and it will also be helpful if you find interests you have in common.


People enjoy talking about themselves so you can prepare by getting some questions ready to ask during the date. For example: You could say, ""I noticed you have a basketball at your desk, do you like to play?""
If you find a mutual interest, don't be afraid to recommend participating in the interest together at some point. For example: If you find that you both enjoy hiking you could say, ""I know this great trail not too far from here, let me know if you are interested in hiking it someday!""
There is room for compromise, but don't change yourself for the sake of the guy's interests and don't expect him to always do what interests you.

, It's the best known tool for getting a man's attention. Men enjoy being flirted with as it boosts their confidence level and initiates a playful demeanor for both parties.Although flirting is a fun game, remember to keep the initial flirtation low as you don't want to seem too brash.


A fun way of being flirtatious is to tease. Remember, teasing is not meant to insult, but instead, meant to bait in a flattering or sensual way.
Don't be afraid to touch his arm or hand and laugh in light conversations for emphasis. For example: If he happens to make a quick joke in passing by, lightly touch is upper arm and turn your head up laughing while saying something like, ""oh, you're so funny!"", It is very important to dress appropriately for the date so you do not look or feel uncomfortable in the selected environment. Dates can range from fancy restaurants, to casual dive bars, to movies...etc. You wouldn't want to go to a movie theatre in a cocktail dress!


If you are going to a restaurant you have never been to, look it up on the internet to get the feel of how casual or fancy it is.
Don't be afraid to accessorize! If you are going to a casual place wearing jeans and a simple top, accessorize with a bright colored necklace or earrings. These bright accessories will also enhance your facial features and make your outfit (and yourself) look more interesting while staying casual and simple.

, You don't want to go on your first date with a mask of makeup on. You will want your natural beauty to shine so there are no surprises for later. Stick to the basics and avoid heavy layers and bright eyeshadows.


A good way to add some fun to natural makeup is to add a brighter colored lipstick or gloss.

, Avoid getting flustered and nervous. If you become over-excited or overwhelmed you will increase your blood pressure and your body will react with anxiety by becoming sweaty and/or shaky and you may even become sick to your stomach.Remember to relax by telling yourself this is just another normal night of fun.


When getting ready, there are a couple things you can try to calm your nerves before your date arrives. Try drinking tonic water or ginger ale, listening to relaxing music or watching a funny show or reading a book or playing a puzzle to keep your mind occupied.

, Declarations of undying love in the early stages are terrifying for most people, as they suggest an undesirable clinginess. Keep conversations fun and exciting without leaning towards talks of romance and extended future plans. Keep in mind you are still learning about each other so instead of professing your love, keep him intrigued by your charm and confident character.


Love should take time; if it's based on looks, it's time to rethink your relationship.
Try friendship as a first step. It can't hurt to get to know one another better, especially when you're not sure of his interest or intentions.

, Give subtle hints to show you want this new relationship to continue. Let him know how much you are enjoying getting to know him and you are having a great time on the date(s).


Be careful with your words. As stated before, you don't want to seem too clingy but you also don't want to seem distant or uninterested. If he asks you if you would like to meet again this week respond with ""I would really like that"" (avoid the word ""love"") or a more flirtatious ""I suppose I could squeeze you in"" (add a little wink or a cute smile).
Don't make yourself seem so readily available, this could potentially make your date think you are waiting around for him to keep asking you out. If he asks ""When can you go out again"" don't respond with ""any day works for me"", instead ask ""Hm, what days work for you and I will see if those are also open for me!""

, If your first dates are going well and there seems to be more on their way don't hesitate to suggest a new place or a new fun idea. It can be very beneficial to get out of the same scene and get to know the person better in a different environment.


Suggest something that you found you have a mutual interest in or something that he has never tried before. Some examples of new and interesting dates include: Going on a hike, going to a sporting event, the zoo or a museum, or taking a cooking class.

, If your dates have been going exceptionally well and you see many more in your future you should suggest going on a double date with your friends. This is a great way to start transitioning your relationship into something more. By having your friends around you you can see how his personality changes or doesn't change and it is a great way of deciding if you want to continue the relationship with him or if he just doesn't fit in for you and you might need to re-think you seeing each other.


This is also true for his friends as well. If you happen to meet them or go on a double date with his friends you can see if he is the same guy he has been portraying or if he is someone different than what you expected.

, If you believe it is time to discuss furthering your relationship then feel free to be open about wanting to make it a steady thing. After a few weeks, say you would like it if the two of you could see one another regularly. This will give you a good indication of the worth or risk of continuing before you get in too deep and get your hopes up too high.


Avoid using intimidating conversation starters such as, ""we need to talk"" or ""can I ask you something"". You want to approach the situation as casually as possible. A good alternative would be ""I have really enjoyed my time with you and I wanted to see if our feelings are mutual.""

, This doesn't mean he wants anything to end. This just means he might not be as ready for a solid relationship as you are. But, that doesn't necessarily mean it won't happen. Everyone has a different dating history and his could result in him just needing to take time in gaining trust. Your reaction could be the ultimatum if he does want to continue or if he decides maybe it's time to end it.


If he says that he is not ready for a relationship yet but still wants to see you, you shouldn't feel rejected and instead reply with ""That is great and I would really like to keep getting to know you as well!"" Your confidence will be reassuring and help him relax and get comfortable to continue with your date.

, The next level is where you start to spend more time together and really begin to understand each other in greater detail. Remember, this is still the beginning and you don't want to make it more than what it really is.

, The most important thing in relationships is to continue having fun. Nothing needs to be really serious until it is time. But, until then, continue to make things fun, new and exciting. Do all those intriguing and flirtatious things you did when you first starting dating, don't stop just because you are in the next level of your relationship.


Keep things exciting with new ideas or weekly events. Plan a day of the week to be reserved specifically for an exciting date, no matter what it is.

Approach a girl indirectly.,
Compliment her, and really mean it.,
Be nice to her friends.,
Tease her.,
Tell her you’re busy.,
Give her some space.,
Take a wingman.",How to Get Girls2," This will allow you to engage her in a conversation without making it too obvious you are interested. There are so many opportunities to strike up a conversation if you just pay attention. If you notice she has a watch, you can ask her for the time. If you are at a mall, you can ask her where a certain store is. Then seize your chance to strike up a conversation with her. Since she is not expecting to get hit on, you will probably be able to talk more casually and she will too.

, Her hair, outfit and shoes are perfect choices, because she will have put a lot of effort into deciding these things. She will appreciate when a man notices her efforts to look nice, especially a man she is interested in.


Try telling her that her beautiful skin makes her glow or that you love the shade of her hair.
Tell her that her outfit looks great, or that you love how she paired her shoes with her outfit.
Try to avoid doing anything like suggesting that she is the best-looking woman in her group of friends. She may take this as an insult to her friends, rather than a compliment to herself.

, If she is with a friend and you exclude the friend while chatting her up, she will feel guilty. She may leave you to go hang out with her friend, so be polite to her friends too and include them in the conversation.


For example, if you ask the girl you like if she would like a drink, turn to her friend after asking her and ask ""Would you like anything too?” You will not only seem generous, but also considerate.

, This didn’t stop working just because grade school is over. A little light-hearted teasing can liven up the conversation and add some humor. If she likes the wrong sports team, or listens to an artist you don’t like, tease her about it a little. The key is knowing when to quit. If she isn’t laughing and smiling along with you, it’s better to stop.


For example, if you notice she has a Patriots keychain, you can let her know you have an air pump at home and can swing by and inflate some footballs if she wants to trade numbers.

, During your conversation, let her know you’d love to take her out but you’re just so busy lately.This will make you seem in demand, unavailable, and thus more desirable. Instead of playing hard to get, she will then have to work to be worthy of your time.

, You struck up a conversation and it's going well, and now you need to know when to quit. Excuse yourself to use the restroom, or go visit another friend or acquaintance if any are around. Just be sure to let her know you'll be back so she doesn't feel abandoned. Show her the whole night doesn't hinge on whether you talk with her or not. This will also give her enough time to arrange for her friends to find something or someone else to do.

, When you head out to get girls, your buddy can help keep your target's friends busy. You may need back up if the girl you are trying to get is being advised by her friends to move along.


Choose your crew carefully. Take a close look at your friends. They don't need to be Ryan Gosling to hang with you, but they should be pleasant to be around.

Be confident.,
Be a gentleman.,
Talk yourself up on the sly.,
Be cautious when making the first move.,
Be honest with whatever you're saying to her.,
Let her know exactly what you're looking for.",How to Get Girls3," You want to be confident, not cocky. The best ways to do this are with your body language. Body language will tell a girl a lot of things about you, so pay attention to how you present yourself.


Speak clearly and stand up straight.
Make eye contact when you are having a conversation.
Smile.
Be approachable. Don't appear preoccupied with your phone, or act disinterested in what is going on around you.

, Open doors for her, and pull out chairs to let her sit down. Saying please and thank you are basic manners. Failing to display basic manners is neither sexy or cute. Knowing how to display common courtesy shows that you had either had a good upbringing or have improved yourself. Either could be seen as attractive to some women.

, If you sing, go rock climbing, or speak a foreign language, you should slip that detail into a conversation nonchalantly.The key is picking the right moment.


Ask her questions about herself. If you want to find an opportunity to slip in information about your musical talents, start by asking her what kind of music she likes. Then comment on her response from a musician's perspective. For example, if she says she likes a certain band you can say their guitarist is great and he inspired you to learn to play yourself.
Bragging, boastful behavior can be a big turn off, so avoid going over the top. Avoid talking about money or how many girls you've slept with. Most women aren't going to be impressed.

, Don’t just go in for a kiss. This can be your third or fourth move, but it is not a first move.


Seize an opportunity to gently brush her hair from her face. This shows your soft, caring side.
You could also tell her how pretty she looks, or how beautiful her eyes are.
A kiss on the forehead is sweet and, not too sensual.
Touch her in non-sexual places. The upper back and hands are usually okay places.

, Telling lies scores no points at all. You might have to tell her something and forget. If she brings it up on another date and you don't remember, you will look really bad.

, Tell her if you want a serious relationship, an open relationship, or just some fun dates. Don't get her hopes up falsely. If you are just looking for a fling, let her know. Don't be selfish and break her heart, and always be prepared to be let down yourself.

If you don't feel like you can ask him outright for a date, you can go about it in a roundabout way. For instance, you can say what you're up to this weekend and see if he takes the bait.You could text, ""What are your plans for the weekend? I'm going to the movies. U?""
If you tell him what you're doing, you're opening the door for him to invite himself along.

, If you want to go a more direct route, you can go ahead and ask him out over text. Just keep it casual. That way, you give him a chance to back out if he isn't actually interested in you like you hoped.Try something like ""It's been a long week. I could use some fun this weekend. How about it?""
You could also be more straightforward: ""I'd love to go out sometime. Do you want to have coffee this weekend?""

, Texting can help build anticipation for a date, so try texting him the day before or the day of the date. Just let him know you're excited about it, or that you're looking forward to seeing him.For instance, you could write a simple, ""I can't wait to see you tonight!""
You could also make it a bit flirtatious by adding in a compliment: ""I'm looking forward to seeing you tonight, especially in those tight jeans you always wear.""

, If your date was amazing, a text is a good way to tell him that. Of course, a call says even more, but if you don't have the time to call him the next day, sending a text can help reassure him that you had a good time, too.A simple ""Last night was amazing!"" is all you need.
However, getting more specific doesn't hurt, either. ""I loved that you took me to a sushi place last night. It was delicious! And I loved sharing the night with you.""

Keep it short and sweet.,
Watch your tone.,
Don't wait too long.,
Don't send too many.,
Skip the alcohol.,
Try not to read into everything.,
Look over your texts before sending.",How to Flirt with a Guy over Text3," While you don't have the texting limitations of the days of old, you do still want to keep your interactions short. Long texts can be a turn off, as your guy has to wade through all that text just to figure out what you're saying.In other words, don't write him a novel.
Shortcuts are fine, as long as the person you're texting is a fan of them, such as LOL (Laugh Out Loud) or BRB (Be Right Back).
However, you don't want to overuse shortcuts, especially ones that are more obscure.These shortcuts, along with a emojis, can be a turn off for some people., Sarcasm is hard to portray over a text message, especially if you don't know the other person that well. Try to skip the sarcasm when flirting with a guy, at least until you both get to know each other better and are better at interpreting each other's tone., Sometimes, you may feel like you need to play games with the person that you like by waiting to respond. It's a type of power struggle. However, in the world of texting, not texting him back in at least a day says you don't like him much.So if you do like him, make sure to text him back fairly quickly.
Really, in the texting world, an hour can seem like a long time.

, If you're sending twenty messages a day, that may be too many, especially if he's not responding to every single one. Keep your count lower, in the 3 to 5 range per day. That way, he has a chance to miss you between the times you're texting.Also, skip the ""Did you get my text?"" messages, as they can come off as being too desperate. If he's not responding, he's likely just busy.

, Texting while drunk means you may text something you regret later. You may flirt a little more than you mean to, or you may turn the guy off because you're saying crazy things. While it may not be easy to stop yourself when you're in the situation, try to avoid it if possible., If you're an overanalyzer, text messages can be your worst nightmare. It gives you just enough text to analyze but not enough so that you can really glean more information from it. If you have this tendency, try not to read too much into what each text is saying. Sometimes, a ""Hi."" is just a hello, not him saying he's not into you because he didn't use an exclamation point., You know autocorrect is sometimes not your friend. Read your text to make sure it makes sense before you send it. That way, you won't get a ""huh?"" back from him.Also, while you don't need perfect grammar to send a text, watching your grammar doesn't hurt. Not everyone is offended by imperfect grammar, but few people while hate on you for having good grammar.

Ask her out!",How to Approach Women Anywhere," There is no great mystery to talking to women. Women are just people and the most comfortable way for you to talk to them, as well as the way that makes them the most receptive, is for you to talk to them the same way you'd talk to anyone else. By just practicing and learning to talk to strangers in general, you'll build up pretty much all of the skills that you need to approach and talk to women successfully. The more you talk to random strangers, the less anxiety you will experience and soon you will realize ""Hey, it's not a big deal!""


A lot of guys (and even some women) will make it out that you need to use particular phrases, tricks, or manipulative behaviors in order to talk to and get women, but what they're prescribing only gets the attention of weird women that you don't want to deal with anyway.;
, You don't have to be or make yourself 'traditionally attractive'. The thing is, when you wear clothes that look bad on you when you don't shower or wear deodorant, when you don't take care of your body, you communicate to other people (women especially!) that you don't think you're worth taking care of or putting effort into. If you don't think you're worth loving, then why should she, you know?


Smell is especially important. A guy that smells off can quickly take on a creeper vibe. Wear good deodorant, clean clothes, and a very mild cologne or body spray.

, If you want to increase your chances of talking to her successfully, it's a good idea to watch her for a little while and use some careful analysis to figure out how you should and shouldn't talk to her. See what you can figure out about her by looking at her.


Is she wearing a particularly nice item or one that looks handmade? It might make a good source for a compliment. Is she dressed very conservatively? She may be trying to reduce the chances of a guy flirting with her, so be more subtle in your approach.
Once she notices you looking, you’re either going to be “confident” or “creepy,” so be confident and approach her or find a way to buy yourself time without building your creep factor. If she sees you but you're not ready to go over, give her a smile (maybe a wink), and look away bashfully. She'll know you think she's cute, but she won't think you're weird.







, Certain situations just won't be conducive to getting a woman interested in you (serious settings, like business meetings). Others will get you treated as a creeper by default (public transport). Go for areas which are in public and as open as possible. If a lady is too busy feeling cornered and trapped, she's just not going to be open to how charming you really are.

, Few things shout, ""I pick up any woman I can"" quite like a wing man. If a woman feels like you're just taking any fish that will bite, she won't be interested because she won't feel special. Go in alone. This act of bravery shows that you are interested enough in her specifically to tough it out.


Don't be intimidated by a woman that's out with her friends. Being nice and chatty with her friends but clearly interested in her will be flattering. You want to date a woman with good friends, and good friends will always want to see their friend get with a nice guy.

, Probably the most natural way to start a conversation with a woman is to comment on something that's happening around you. See someone do something nice for someone else? ""Man, you don't see enough of that these days."" Someone out on the dance floor making a fool of himself? ""See, that's exactly why I'm not out there dancing."" Be friendly and be casual. It's as simple as that.

, Another good way to break into a conversation with a woman is to ask her a question. Avoid the cliché ""Do you know what time it is?"" because they'll know what you're really after and it makes you seem sleazy. Again, approach it just like starting a conversation with anyone else.


If you're at a restaurant: ""I just can't decide what to eat tonight so I'm leaving it up to fate: what do you recommend for dinner?""
If you're out where there's music: ""Do you know what song this is? I don't normally listen to this kind of music, but I really like this song.""
If you're at school: ""Do you know where the ______ building is?""

, If she's even remotely attractive, she probably has a guy hitting on at least every time she goes out. You're just going to be one more weirdo to avoid unless you set yourself apart. Don't compliment her appearance. Instead, compliment her on something she doesn't expect but will appreciate.


If she has buttons on her bag, an item that's clearly hand made, or a book you read and enjoyed, these are better sources for compliments because you're complimenting something that's uniquely her instead of what might as well be just about any woman's hair or eyes.

, Let her catch you looking at her with a confused expression. After a minute or so, go up to her and say something like, ""I'm really sorry, but I just can't remember your name. I know I've met you before, but I can't figure out where. I didn't want to be rude and have you think I was ignoring you."" Play it off that you just wanted to come over for a quick hello, maybe play a short game of figuring out where you've met before, and then seem about ready to excuse yourself. Use the opportunity to break into another conversation (something about the environment around you would be easiest).

, There is a certain merit in simply walking up to her and saying, in a frank tone, ""You're probably used to this but I'm new to it, so here it goes: I don't know you, but I'd like to. I think you're beautiful...and who doesn't want more of that in their life?"" Some women will appreciate the honesty.

, Introducing yourself is simply the polite thing to do. Do it without the handshake or other physical greetings though, and try to avoid making her feel like she has to do the same. Give your name and quickly move the conversation on to something else. This makes her feel like she has the upper hand, which will make her more comfortable.

, As said above, if a woman is even remotely nice looking, she probably has guys telling her so every day. There are probably plenty of guys that flirt with her. If you want to be successful when you approach her, you need to set yourself apart. The best way to do this is to act natural and flirt as little as possible. Talk about something interesting, not about what her boobs look like in that dress.


Be “social” not a “shark.” The guy who walks into a bar, circles around a few times, and then gets the courage to approach women one by one may be going home alone. Most women are familiar with this type. Talk socially to everyone and have fun – you’re not a starving hunter desperate for a meal.

, Give her some personal space when you go up to her. Never stand in a way that blocks her exit from the area. Don't touch her. Maybe even act a little bashful. When a woman feels threatened, it doesn't matter how awesome you actually are. She's going to be too focused on her own safety to enjoy talking to you.

, Boasting, bragging, and talking a lot about yourself doesn't impress women: it just tells them that you're self-centered and would probably be terrible to be in a relationship with. Instead, be humble when you talk to them and don't act like you're entitled to their company. Earn the right to be talking to them. Focus the conversation on them and not you.

, You don't want her to think that you're lying to her through your actions, so try to be as genuine and sincere as possible. Don't try to act like some guy that you're not. Just be yourself and be honest about what you think.

, Ending by asking her out, even if you took the straightforward approach, is a bad idea. When you ask a woman out without getting to know her, you're generally telling her that you're only interested in her looks. If you don't know her as a person yet, how can you really be interested in anything more? So instead, in order to build her trust in you, invite her to visit an event you attend regularly (dance club at your school, Sunday volunteer at the local soup kitchen, same day same time at the location you're currently at, etc.) so that you can see each other again. You can also ask for her phone number or, even better, her email. Just give her the feeling of choice and the sense that you really do want to get to know her better, not just sleep with her as soon as possible.

, Look for an open vs closed body posture. If she's squirming in her seat and angling herself away from you, she's creeped out. However, if she's relaxed and keeping her body posture open and facing you, she's probably a bit receptive.

, If she's keeping eye contact or making flirty eyes, she's probably receptive. However, if you see her occasionally looking towards the door, clock, or crowds of people, she's probably feeling trapped and looking for an escape. Break the tension by apologizing for bothering her and give her some space. She might very well relax enough to reenter the conversation.

, If she's giving short answers and seems to be trying to end the conversation then she's uncomfortable and you're probably not going to get anywhere. However, if she's giving longer answers or even asking you questions, then she's probably open to having a good conversation.

, If you see her flexing her hands, she's probably mad or offended that you're talking to her. If she's clutching her hands to her body or holding her purse tightly, she's at least uncomfortable. However, if her hands are relaxed and she's casually using them to talk, then she's more receptive to conversation.

, Sometimes a woman that seems receptive, friendly, or even flirty may quickly become closed and unsure. This is a natural emotional reaction to the course of the conversation and her own analysis of your interactions. If she's becoming uncomfortable, ease up. And remember: no matter how friendly or interested she seemed, it doesn't obligate her to give you her number or go on a date with you. Don't get angry if she says no.

, Confidence vs arrogance is very important. You need to show her that you like you and think you're worthwhile as a person, but you don't want to come across as that guy that's just in love with yourself. Build your confidence by taking on challenges and giving yourself the opportunity to do things that you can be proud of.

, Flirting can be tough, especially if you're inexperienced and she's gorgeous and gets flirted with all the time. If you learn to compliment her on the right things, break from the player transcript, and focus on her, though, you'll be getting a date before you know it.

, Starting conversations with people you don't know can be difficult. Don't worry, though: like a lot of things, it's a learned skill. You don't have to come by it naturally.

, Dating strangers doesn't have the best likelihood of introducing you to a fulfilling experience with a woman. If you're tired of relationships that are unsatisfying, try meeting someone who's really right for you.

, When you are finally ready to ask her out, make sure you do it right. You don't want to say something offensive, rude, or creepy and ruin all that hard work you put in!

Respect your date’s love for dogs.,
Be honest but tactful about how your feel about dogs.,
Set boundaries if you are not a huge dog fan.,
Prepare yourself for the initial meeting.,
Conduct some research to gain insight into your date’s passion.,
Determine if you can find common ground.",How to Date a Dog Lover," Maybe dogs aren’t your thing, but instead of focusing on his/her affection for dogs, learn to respect and admire his/her commitment to another living being.


View how your date cares for his/her dog to be a preview of how this person may be in a parental role. If you find a happy, healthy dog you can make an assumption that he/she could possibly be a present, positive parental role model. Of course being a good dog parent doesn’t mean that your date will certainly make for a good mother or father, however the fact that your date can consistently care for another living being is a positive quality.
Consider your date’s commitment to dogs to be an admirable quality. If you are looking to date someone who has passions and goals, a dog lover could certainly fit the bill.
Try to gain some of your date’s love for dogs. Perhaps you never really considered the topic of dog ownership or rescue, but dating someone who feels passionate about the topic may open the door to a new interest for you.;
, Not everyone is a dog (or animal) lover. So if you really don’t like dogs or any animal for that matter, let your date know, but in a very tactful, positive way.


Explain how much you admire his/her affinity for dogs. Start with a positive in order to set the tone for the conversation. Regardless of whether you like dogs or not, you can certainly admire your date’s passion.
Talk about an incident you experienced in the past with a dog. If you had a bad experience with a pooch in the past, communicate what happened with your date. Whether you were attacked or felt nervous in a dog’s presence let your date know so you can make adjustments to how and when you meet his/her pup.
Tell your date what kind of environment would make you most comfortable. If it means that you wait several months before meeting Fido, let your date know. You want your relationship to work and in order for you to get past your feelings about dogs you need to solidify the connection between the humans.
Be open to changing your mind. Don’t tell your date that you will never, ever like dogs or be open to being around dogs. As your relationship grows and deepens you may open up to at least tolerating or even liking his/her pooch. So don’t close the door on any possibilities.

, If you like dogs but are not as enthusiastic about them, you may need to set some boundaries that both you and your honey can follow.


Set boundaries for when and where the dog can coexist. Whether you sleep over or are having dinner at his/her house, communicate what you can handle and what you can’t. For example you may not mind the dog hopping on the couch with you while you watch TV but may draw the line at bedtime (insist the dog sleep in his/her own bed instead of with you).
Keep the relationship human-centric. If your date seems to want to talk about dogs or his/her dog during the majority of your dates, ask that other topics be discussed instead. Politely point out that you spend over half of your dates talking about Skippy and that you’d love to learn more about your date’s job or family instead.
Maintain flexible, fluid rules. Nothing has to be set in stone. As you get to know your date’s dog better you may develop the same level of affection and want to change a few rules.

, Meeting your date’s dog is a big deal, which can be compared to meeting someone’s children for the first time. Being fully prepared can put you're in a better position to keep your cool during that initial meeting, plus score points with your date.


Ask questions about the dog. In order to ascertain how you should approach the dog, ask your date about how the dog will be most comfortable. In some cases you should not look the dog in the eyes, pat him/her on top of the head or get in the dog’s face. Every dog has a different temperament so knowing how your date’s dog reacts to new people will allow you to prepare your introduction.
Bring a gift. You’ll score points with both your date and the dog if you bring a cute dog toy or treat (find out if the dog is allergic or cannot eat certain foods).
Follow your date’s doggy introduction instructions to the letter for a successful initial meeting. Even if the dog is super adorable and you have the urge to snuggle him/her do exactly what your date has instructed. This initial meeting will show your date that you respect how he/she wants you to meet the dog and will most likely set you up for a calm, positive introduction.

, Wondering why your date is in love with dogs? Doing a little research may unearth some answers and lend insight into why some folks are “dog people.”


Read about your date’s dog breed. If your date has a Pit bull Terrier you may want to read about this type of breed and it’s nature. Although Pit bulls have notoriously received bad press for being aggressive, this breed is actually very gentle when raised by a responsible owner.
Learn from dog and medical experts about the benefits of owning and appreciating an animal. From easing blood pressure to helping couples meet, dog ownership provides numerous positive health benefits. In fact, researcher Judith Siegel, PhD says that dog owning patients suffering from AIDS experience less depression than those who do not own a pet.
Research service dog organizations that train and supply special therapy and service dogs to people suffering from physical and mental disabilities. Seeing how dogs can help people may provide you with insight and appreciation for these animals.

, If you are both voracious dog lovers you may have found a match made in heaven. However, if your appreciation for your date’s four legged, furry family member is not as strong, determine if you can look past his/her dedication or not.


Is your date willing to compromise? Does your date want to see you halfway or has it turned into a situation where you feel that it’s “me or the dog?”
Are there certain habits that you can’t overlook? From kissing his/her pooch on the lips to talking incessantly about the dog 24/7, are there things that you just cannot live with no matter what?
Can you see yourself in this relationship long term--you, him/her and the dog? This maybe a “threesome” so you need to decide if you can accept your date’s dog as part of the package.

If you're only looking to date casually yourself, this may not be an issue for you. However, if you're hoping for a more serious romance, make sure the man in question is ready to commit to a romantic relationship.


If someone is recently divorced, they may have hesitations regarding commitment. A divorced man may enjoy your company at first, but become nervous if things get serious. He may be afraid of repeating old patterns or mistakes. Going into the relationship, keep in mind emotional intimacy may be an issue.Think about what you want out of the relationship. Are you looking for a potential longterm partner? If so, someone with commitment issues may not be the best choice for you. However, if you're at a time in your life that you're uninterested in a serious romance, the question of commitment may not be as important. You may be fine pursuing something casual.;
, When dating a divorced man, the relationship may progress slower than usual. Normal relationship milestones, such as meeting the parents and giving things an official label, may happen at a slower pace. Even amicable divorces are painful, and a divorced man may proceed with hesitance.Understand what your partner is going through. In addition to the pain of a divorce, there may be added scrutiny from family members. His parents or siblings may, for example, be distrusting of a new partner.
It's not uncommon for a divorced man to want to take things slow. Try to be patient during this process. If you really like this person, it will eventually be worth the wait. If you get frustrated, try to think of all the reasons you're continuing with the relationship. Remind yourself why you were initially drawn to this person.

, Navigating a new romantic relationship is always tough. Divorce, however, adds another layer of complication. Do not go into the relationship with specific expectations of how things will progress. A divorced man may be somewhat hesitant or non-comittal at first.There are certain things you could reasonably expect from most boyfriends that may be difficult if your partner is divorced. He may be unable to bring you to family events right away, as family members may not be ready to see him dating again. If he has children, they will take priority. You may not be able to see him certain days of the week or certain weekends, as he will be busy with his kids.
Spontaneity may not be an option with a divorced partner. He may have his guard up more in regards to romantic gestures, for one, and children from a previous marriage can add a complication. He may not be able to whisk you off for a romantic weekend away, for example, if he has children to care for.

, Divorce can be very expensive. Between paying for lawyers, and things like alimony and child support, it can take a few years for divorced people to find financial stability. Do not expect a divorced man to be able to spend a lot of money on you. You may have to plan affordable dates much of the time, especially if your boyfriend is recently divorced.Remember, you don't have to splurge to have fun. If money is still a major issue for your boyfriend, try to plan cheap dates. You could have a beach day, for example, or make dinner at home and watch a movie.
If you feel comfortable doing so, you can also offer to pay once in awhile. You do not want to feel like you're being taken advantage of, but it can be a nice gesture to occasionally pay for a nice dinner if money is an issue for your boyfriend.

, A divorced man may have hesitations about advertising the relationship right away. Divorce is complicated. Children, family members, or mutual friends may have loyalty to the previous partner. Before you do something like, say, updating your Facebook relationship status, have a talk with the man you're dating.Strive to be understanding here. Do not take it personally if your boyfriend would rather keep things somewhat discreet for the time being.
Dating again after a divorce can cause tension. Your boyfriend may simply want to keep things between the two of you uncomplicated for now. He's not necessarily keeping your relationship discreet because he wants to hide you.

, While you want to have patience, a relationship cannot be all give. If a divorced man is not ready to meet your needs, you cannot have a healthy relationship. At some point, think about what you need and whether you feel this man is capable of providing that.Think about you feel fulfilled and cared for. Is this person making you feel that way? Why or why not?
Consider whether there's anything you're agreeing to do that you would rather not do. Is there any way your boyfriend pushes your boundaries?
Is there anything you would like to do in the relationship that is not currently an option?

, If you ever feel your needs are not being met, it's important to communicate as much. You will need to sit down with your boyfriend and talk things out. While his feelings regarding the divorce are importing, your feeling as his current partner also matter.Focus in the present moment. Try not to bring things up from the past. Be direct. If something is bothering you, say so outright. For example, ""I know you're nervous about introducing me to your family, but it's been six months and I really feel it's time.""
Listen to your boyfriend's responses. Give him a chance to explain and respond. The two of you may be able to figure out a way to patch things up and move forward.

, Many people get nervous when they realize they're similar to their boyfriend's ex-husband or wife. Everyone has a type of person they're attracted to, and you may very well have things in common with a previous spouse.There's a good chance you will resemble the ex-spouse physically. Your boyfriend may have specific taste. He may be drawn to a certain hair color, eye color, or body type, for example. There may also be similarities in your personality. Your boyfriend may have a tendency to date people with similar interests or personalities.
Try not to buy too much into similarities between yourself and an ex-spouse. Chances are, you have a type as well. Even if you're not aware of it, there are probably similarities between your current boyfriend and your ex-partners.

, It can be tempting to talk badly about the ex-spouse. This is especially true if your boyfriend's ex has been hostile to you at any point during the relationship. However, it's a bad idea to complain to your boyfriend about his ex. You do not want to come off as jealous or bitter. Also, your boyfriend may harbor negative feelings about his ex that are difficult to process. You do not want to negatively affect his mood by fanning the flames.There may be times when you need to vent about the ex. This is understandable, especially if the ex has not been nice to you. However, if you need to do so, call a friend or family member.
Never let your boyfriend overhear you complaining about his ex. Wait until he's out of the house to call a friend and vent.

, If you're beginning to get serious, you may want to know about the divorce. How and why a divorce happened says a lot about your boyfriend. It can help you better understand how he approaches a relationship in the present.Avoid asking too much at first. This is especially true if it's uncertain how serious the relationship will be. You may not need to know a lot about the divorce, and the circumstances surrounding it,
However, if you're getting serious, it's appropriate to ask. This is especially true if you think this person could become your life partner. You can try to introduce the topic carefully. Say something like, ""If you feel comfortable, I'd like to know a little about your divorce. It obviously had a huge impact on your life, and I'd like to know you more as a person.""

, There are many little things that may feel like a snub or a rebuff when dating a divorced man. You may, for example, not be invited to certain family dinners or outings with mutual friends of your partner's spouse. Try to remember these things are not personal. It can be very awkward navigating the dating world coming out of a divorce. Your boyfriend is probably not trying to hurt your feelings. Certain situations may simply be difficult or awkward. Keep in mind it rarely has anything to do with you personally., In the beginning of your relationship with him, your boyfriend may opt not to introduce you to his children. Your boyfriend may want to wait to introduce you until your relationship is serious. The kids have already been through a lot with the divorce, so there isn’t any sense in letting them get to know a woman who may not be a permanent fixture.Do not compete for his time, especially if he occasionally needs to spend time with his kids.


Even after you've been integrated into the family, your boyfriend may still need alone time with his kids. Try to be understanding of this fact. Remember, they will always be the priority.

, Children may be distrustful or hostile to a new romantic partner for their parent. They probably have loyalty to your partner's ex. Understand this going in, and strive to keep interactions positive even if there is tension.Plan to meet in a neutral, public setting at first. Try to plan something fun, and appropriate for the children's ages. You can plan to meet at a kid-friendly restaurant or plan a trip to somewhere like the zoo.
Ask about the kids. Ask about their hobbies, interests, favorite movies, favorite TV shows, and so on. You want to show your boyfriend, and his kids, you're making an honest effort to get to know them.
When appropriate, share a little about yourself. This can help the kids get to know you better. For example, you can interject something like, ""Oh, I loved that movie when I was your age too.""

, You will probably not be accepted by the family right away. This is especially true with children. If your boyfriend has gone through a divorce, there may be a lot of skepticism of a new partner. Going into social interactions, keep this is in mind.Remind yourself it's normal not to be best friends with everyone right away. Try to put yourself in your boyfriend's family's shoes. It's understandable they'll have reservations about a new partner, especially if your boyfriend's divorce was difficult or unexpected.

, Never push your boyfriend to introduce you to his family before he is ready, especially his children. There are many reasons your boyfriend may want to hold off on the introductions, and they are usually not personal. Allow him to go at his own pace and be respectful of when and how he chooses to make introductions."

Join a club.,
Visit campus hangouts.,
Go to parties.",How to Date a College Girl1," If you’re a college student yourself, you’ll spend a good part of your day in classes too, so it only makes sense to look around and see if there are any interesting girls among your classmates. You’re probably have the best luck in a class in your favorite subject because there’s a chance that you’ll share some common interests.If you’re uncomfortable approaching girls, meeting in class can help take some of the nerves out of the experience because you’ll have a conversation starter ready to go -- ask for help with an assignment or commiserate about the professor.
Take advantage of group projects that might come up in classes. It’s a good way to get to know a girl without the pressure of having to approach her.;
, Working while you’re a student isn’t just a great way to ensure that you have some extra cash; it can be a great opportunity to meet new people. You may find a girl who you like among your co-workers or your customers if you’re working somewhere like the bookstore or snack bar. Just as with meeting someone in class, getting to know someone on the job can take some of the pressure off because you’ll already have something in common.If you’re not a student yourself, it may be difficult to get a job on campus. Instead, try to find a position at a business near campus that’s frequented by students, such as a coffee house or sandwich shop.
You don’t necessarily have to look for a paying job. Volunteer positions and internships can also offer opportunities to meet girls.

, Relationships usually work best when you share interests with your partner, so it’s a good idea to look for a girl who you have something in common with. Whether you get involved with the school newspaper, environmental club, or an intramural sport, you’ll meet plenty of new people who are interested in the same thing you are -- and you can really get to know someone well when you’re working toward a common goal.If you can’t find a club on campus that suits your interests, consider starting your own organization.

, It only makes sense that you’ll meet plenty of college girls at spots where students congregate, so spend time at the dining hall, student union, and even the library. If there aren’t popular hangouts on campus or you’re not a student, try off-campus locales that students frequent, such as coffee shops, bars, clubs, and restaurants., Meeting a girl when she’s in a social mood may improve your chances of getting a date, so a party is usually a great opportunity to get to know someone. Frat parties, house parties, and even school dances can provide a fun setting to meet a girl.If you’re not the partying type, it’s best not to force yourself to go a party. You’ll likely feel uncomfortable, and only wind up meeting someone who has different interests from yours.

"
"
Make a good first impression.,
Ask about her.,
Call or text her after first meeting.,
Ask her out.,
Plan a relaxed first date.",How to Date a College Girl2," It probably goes without saying because the goal is always to make your first meeting with a new person positive, but it’s especially important with college girls, who probably have plenty of date options on campus. That’s why you want to take care with your appearance and be polite and attentive when you first make contact.If you’re talking to a girl at party, make sure you haven’t had too much to drink. While liquid courage may make it easier to approach her, she probably isn’t going to be impressed if you’re slurring your words and having trouble staying on your feet.

, To show that you have genuine interest in a girl, you should want to learn more about her. Asking open-ended questions, rather than simple yes-no inquiries, usually works best because it gives her a chance to really share her experiences, feelings, and opinions with you.Be more creative than simply asking her what her major is or which dorm she lives in. She probably hears those questions a lot. Instead, try to build off of what she says. For example, if she tells you that she loves traveling, ask her what her favorite trip was and why., If you want a girl to take your interest in her seriously, it helps to show that you’re still thinking about her when you’re not together. Phone calls or texts can help establish a rapport that makes her feel comfortable with you, so she’s more willing to say yes when you ask for a date.If you’re not sure what to stay in your phone call or text, ask a follow-up question to your last conversation, share an inside joke about the last time you saw her, or tell her that you saw something that reminded you of her.
Don’t just call or text late at night -- she might get the wrong idea.

, Once you feel like you’ve gotten to know her, there’s nothing left to do but ask her out. You don’t have to be formal, though. Ask her if she’d like to hang out sometime, and if she says yes, suggest a day and time.It’s normal to be nervous before you ask a girl out. Give yourself a little pep talk before you do it, reminding yourself of all your positive qualities.

, You don’t have to take her out for a candlelit dinner right out of the gate. In fact, it’s usually best to make your first outing a low pressure situation, such as grabbing a cup of coffee or having lunch at the student union. However, you should choose a venue that allows for quality conversation, so a movie or noisy bar probably isn’t the best option. Once you’ve gone on a few casual dates, you can progress to more typical outings, such as dinner at a nice restaurant.


When you’re in college, you usually don’t have too much money. That doesn’t mean you can’t take a girl on memorable dates. Some inexpensive date ideas include a school sporting event, a picnic in a local park, or a movie marathon at home."
"
Establish trust.,
Manage your time.,
Give her space sometimes.,
Discuss the future.",How to Date a College Girl3," It’s a key component in any relationship, but when you’re in college, there are so many opportunities to meet new people. Your girlfriend should know what she can trust you, and you should be able to trust her in return. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts to building trust, so you need to put in the time. Being consistently considerate, supportive, loyal, and affectionate is the best way to get your girlfriend to trust you.It will be easier to trust one another if you establish a commitment from the start. Make sure you both know exactly what you expect from one another.

, Between classes, work, extracurricular activities, and friends, college students have a lot of demands on their schedule, but in order for your relationship to thrive, you have to make an effort to see your girlfriend on a regular basis. Even committing to seeing each other only two or three times a week can make a big difference into making your relationship work.If you’re very busy, get creative about finding time to spend with your girlfriend. For example, if you’re both swamped with midterms, study together. You can take turns quizzing each other or meet up to have a late night snack.

, While it's natural to want to spend all your time with someone that you care about, healthy relationships allow for both parties to grow as people. Allow her to cultivate interests that are separate from yours, while you do the same.While she's doing her own thing, it's still important to be supportive. For example, if she takes up a new hobby that you don't participate in, such as the intramural volleyball team, show up for games and events to cheer her on.

, College is a transitional period for many people, and that can make it difficult to keep a relationship going. If you’re serious about your girlfriend, you should have an honest conversation with her about what’s going to happen down the road and where you both expect the relationship to go. For example, if she’s planning to go to graduate school in New York after college and you’re moving to Seattle for medical school, you may decide that you don’t want to get too invested."
"
Understand that she could say ""no."",
Try to psych yourself up to ask her.,
Try sending a friend to talk to her and gauge her interest.,
Understand that asking for her number is not a marriage proposal.,
Go up to her and start a conversation.,
Bring up the idea of contacting her outside of school, work, etc.,
Ask for her number.,
Send a text.,
You don't need to ask her to go on a date right away.,
Avoid talking about anything too controversial or heavy right away.,
When the time feels right, and if you want to, ask her to go on a date.",How to Ask for a Girl's Phone Number," The girl is not obligated to give you her number just because you ask for it. There may be many reasons why she does not want to give you a way to contact her.


This can also give you confidence, though. Her saying ""no"" is the worst thing that can happen when you ask for her number. It is easy to build up all the things that could go wrong, but in reality, her saying ""no"" is the worst it could be.
Be prepared for rejection. Rejection is difficult, but once you accept it, the whole ordeal will feel much less intimidating and scary.;
, In addition to being an attractive trait, confidence will make you feel more comfortable while asking her. Read our article on how to be confident for some ideas.


A good way to be confident in this situation is to keep everything in perspective. Asking for her number may seem like a big deal at the time, but you will likely forget how afraid you were in a year's time.
Remember that rejection can be overcome, but don't assume it will necessarily be the outcome.
While it may sound silly, try standing in a Superman pose for a few minutes before you ask her. Some experts do believe it really can help increase your confidence.

, If you are feeling very doubtful that the girl even thinks of you, ask a friend to talk to her about you. Unless she adamantly says that she is completely not attracted to you, do not let her answer influence your decision too much. She may not think of you too much because you have never been confident enough to talk to her.


Be sure that it is a friend you can trust. You do not want your friend to ruin your chances with the girl by making you sound creepy or invasive. The friend should be able to subtly bring you up in a conversation in order to gauge her opinion of you.
The girl may respect this less than you simply asking for her number. It can help you gain confidence, but it also adds unnecessary stress to this fairly small situation.

, Just because you have a girl's number, it does not mean that you are going out with the girl. Asking for her number is merely a way to stay in closer contact with her to hopefully build a relationship in the future.


This should also help give you confidence and decrease the intimidation factor of asking for a girl's number. While the implication is that you are interested, it does not need to mean anything more than that right away.

, Do not simply run up and ask for her number. Try to weave it into a conversation. Try talking to her about a movie or show you have both recently seen. Ask her how her day was. The conversation can be about anything, but try to keep it light.


Having a conversation will also help you gauge her interest. If all her responses are short, she may not be interested in you. If she gives long answers and asks you questions in return, she likely is interested.
If she laughs at many of your jokes (even ones you know aren't funny), she is definitely interested and likely wants you to ask for her number.

, Bring up something which would require outside contact. If you go to school together, mention how you sometimes struggle with homework and would like to work together. If you work together, mention how you would like to grab dinner or coffee sometime.


Again, pay attention to how she responds to seeing you outside of the normal environment. Pay attention to things like a smile, a light in her eye, or her brushing her hair. These are all signs that she is flattered.

, Do not dance around the topic for too long or you will appear unsure. It really is as simple as asking ""can I get your number?"" People tend to build it up because of the implication of a possible relationship, but it can be simple if you are straightforward.


Much of the stress behind asking for a number can be avoided by simply diving in and asking outright. It is better to ask her outright rather than trying any tricks like getting it from a friend or from a group project.
Speak clearly when you ask for her number. As this question is the point of the entire conversation, be confident and articulate when asking. Don't make her have to ask you to repeat the question.

, Texting is more accepted nowadays then calling out of the blue. It is also much less intimidating. Text her about the conversation you had earlier or start a new conversation.


Do not just text ""hey."" Be engaging and offer a line which can be made into a conversation. The responsibility is on you to start the conversation.
Try to be funny, keep things light, and be yourself when you first start texting her. You don't want to get into a place where you have to keep on pretending to be someone else.

, Remember that just because the girl gave you her number, it does not mean that she is necessarily romantically interested. She may have just not wanted to reject you or she may see you more as a friend.


Text with her for a while to try to gauge her opinion of you. In addition to continuing conversation with her at school or work, try to continue frequent conversation over text or on a phone call.

, Until you get to know her better, try to keep the conversation fairly neutral. Some good things to talk about include:


TV Shows
Movies
Family
Future dreams
Funny stories

, You likely asked her for her number because you are romantically interested in her. Do not wait too long before asking her to go on a date. It could be the first step in a relationship.

Dress well and groom your face and body.,
Speak slowly and avoid rambling.,
Smile often.,
Keep steady eye contact.,
Try not to over-think your actions.,
Remember to breathe.,
Watch your posture.",How to Appear Confident to Women,"


Wear clothing that is both comfortable and classy. Pick a style and stick with it from your tie to your shoes. Add flair to your outfit by including a personal touch. This can be a funky tie, a unique watch or an interesting belt. Showcasing your personality exhibits the confidence you have in your own self.
Trim your beard, mustache, goatee, etc. so that it appears clean and put together. Having a clean face and facial hair can make you feel fresh and give you more confidence than if you just rolled out of bed.
Cut your fingernails, trim the hairs in your ears and nose, and wash your hair. If you style your hair regularly, do so. Avoid trying radical new hairstyles when trying to impress a woman. The uncertainty of the new style might make you lose confidence.;
,


Try to slow your speech down by at least 50 percent. When you're nervous, your voice tends to raise an octave and you begin speaking faster.
Focus on being calm when speaking. If you think about each word before you say it, you will slow down automatically. This can also prevent you from misspeaking and having to put your foot in your mouth during conversation.
Stay on topic with the conversation. Say only as much as the conversation requires. Once you answer a question, do not continue to speak to fill a silence.

,


Practice a genuine smile in the mirror. A genuine smile is not too cheesy or large. It feels comfortable when you do it and doesn't come off as creepy to others. A genuine smile shows confidence; and a genuine laugh is even better.

,


Look at the woman whom you are talking to or listening to for as long as you or she is speaking. Men who aren't confident tend to have wandering or shifty eyes. When a woman speaks directly to a man with little confidence, the man usually has a hard time returning a strong gaze. This shouts nervousness.

,


Understand the meaning of your words, but do not go over every conversation in your head after or during.
Try not to over-think an action such as pouring a drink or lifting a glass to your mouth. Over-thinking these basic actions puts an emphasis on them, and the extra pressure you exert on the situation can cause you to mess up when you otherwise wouldn't have.

,


Speak at a natural pace and breathe often. When people get nervous, they sometimes forget to breathe. When they finally do breathe, it causes them to blurt out their words.

,


Stand up as straight as you can. Pull your shoulders back and lift your head up. If you do one thing when trying to appear confident, it should be maintaining perfect posture.
People who slouch appear sloppy, unkempt and timid. You will feel more confident immediately once your posture is straight.

, You want him to get to know you well, so tell him about your dreams, hopes and interests. Tell him about your friends, school, even what you want to buy at the mall on Friday. They want to hear it because they like knowing what is on their girlfriend's mind. Just don't blab about it and go on and on!

, Listen to him when he talks, and respond. Otherwise, he might think you're ignoring him or just interested in yourself.


Don't just talk about yourself. Ask him what he likes to do for fun and what his dreams and hopes are too.

, If you don't like something, tell him! Don't lie just to agree with him. Guys like partners who have their own opinions.

, Guys don't like when partners are all over them. Sure they want their partner to be crazy about them, but that doesn't mean you have to be clingy. Give him some space. What's sexy to a guy is when a partner is independent. They have a life outside of his. But it is okay to text or IM him when you're not with him. Just be sure not to nag him.

, Do things that both of you find interesting. While it's good to compromise some of the time and do things that the other person likes, it's also important to find things you like to do in common, so that you can be together and have fun at the same time.

, Don't just do and say the same things everyday. If you always do the same things, there's a risk he'll grow bored. He should learn something new about you each time you talk.

Put on the brakes.,
Take off the rose-tinted glasses.,
Practice quid pro quo (a Latin phrase for ""this for that"").,
Don't be suffocating.,
Recognize signs that the other person is no longer interested.,
Respect the other person's wishes.,
See if your needs are being met.",How to Stop Being Needy1," Every relationship develops at its own pace, and there's no need to fast forward to being ""soul mates"" or ""best friends forever"" just because things feel great. Cherish the novelty of it all and the excitement of having something new, because it'll never be new again. It can be nerve-wracking not knowing how a certain connection is going to unfold, but it's also exciting! Be patient and learn to savor that excitement. Don't try to push the connection into a stage that it's not ready for, or you'll miss the fun and create stress.


If you had a blast when you went out on Friday night, you probably can't wait to replicate the experience as soon as possible. However, instead of calling up your friend first thing Saturday morning to make more plans, give it a few days. Savor the fun time you had and give your friend the chance to savor it, too. When it's time to hang out again, you'll both have had the chance to actually look forward to seeing each other, making your time together all the sweeter.;
, Part of the reason people get disproportionately excited sometimes is because we tend to idealize others in the very beginning of a relationship. When you first meet someone with whom you have a connection, it's so easy to get lost in fantasies of how awesome your friendship or relationship might be. However, with those fantasies come high expectations, and sometimes those expectations are unrealistic! Right now you might think you want to spend all of your time with the person, but you're setting yourself up to be let down.


Make it a point to remind yourself that this new person in your life is human, which means they're not perfect. They will make mistakes, and you need to be ready to cope and forgive, rather than act shocked that the person dares to be anything but perfect.

, Imagine your interaction with this person is like a tennis or volleyball game. Every time you initiate contact, you throw the ball to their side of the court. Then, you have to wait for them to send it back. You don't toss a whole bunch more just to make sure he or she is still interested in playing. If you're a little on the needy side, you probably get nervous and worried while you're waiting. When this happens, take a deep breath. If you've already gotten in touch with someone (you sent them an e-mail or text message, or you gave them a call and left a voice message) there's no need to do it again. Whenever you do get the urge to contact them again, remember that there are only a few possibilities here:


They haven't gotten the message yet.
They've been too busy or preoccupied to get back to you. If you trust this person, then you have to give him or her the benefit of the doubt and assume this is the case.
They aren't interested in hanging out at the moment.

, No matter how close you are to another person, spending all your time with him or her is going to get overwhelming. Even if the person loves you, he or she is not going to want to be with you at every waking (and maybe sleeping) moment. If you find it difficult to be away from the person for even a few minutes, you're almost definitely creating a situation that will eventually blow up in your face. As hard as it might be, force yourself to back off and give the person some space. Spend a few nights away, do activities you like to do, and don't call or text for a bit. Your relationship will definitely improve, because the old adage that ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" is true.

, It happens sometimes for a variety of reasons, but one thing is for sure--showering the person with more attention will never change their mind. Persistence is not the answer! Pulling away may be the person's way of jumping ship without confronting you. Any prodding from you won't change the way they feel, and deep down inside, you know that. If someone doesn't have the decency to respond, they're not worth your time. You deserve better than that.


Think about whether the person is acting fickle. Some people just aren't good about maintaining a friendship or relationship, and sometimes they're lazy, or forgetful. More often, though, if someone isn't responsive, it's not because they forgot to call you back - it's because they made a choice not to.
It might be that the other person just needs some time to focus on other things for awhile. It doesn't have to mean the end of your relationship.

, Getting ignored or iced out can feel like rejection - well, it is rejection, and that really hurts. But once someone has decided they're ready to move on, there's nothing you can do to force the issue. Do your best to move on and resist the urge to be pushy. Lashing out or trying to hurt the other person in return will only make the person grow even more distant.

, If the person on your mind doesn't flat-out reject you, but he or she demonstrates flaky behavior and seems to be leading you on, think about whether you really want this person in your life. Just because you want to spend time with your friend or significant other doesn't make you ""needy."" All relationships require some time and effort to maintain. If the person is making you feel like you're asking for too much, but you know you're not being excessively needy, then maybe it's the other person who has a problem.


Decide how much time and attention you want to give the relationship, and figure out how much you expect in return. If your expectations are reasonable, but you're always feeling let down or neglected, it might be time to find a new friend or significant other who makes you feel valued and cared for.
Relationships aren't easy to balance - it often seems like one person is putting in more effort. It's normal to have phases where one person is often busy and the other one seems to be calling and texting more. However, if this is a constant pattern in your relationship, and you don't think it's going to change, get out of the relationship before it hurts your self-esteem.

A huge part of warming her up, of course, is making her feel comfortable and safe. You're going to see a lot of steps below about respecting her, seeking consent, and otherwise doing things that you might not think of as ""turn-ons"". Don't neglect them, they're important. Sex is very mental for many girls and women and if you help them by making it so that they don't have to worry, then that's half the battle.;
, You know that warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you find out that someone thinks you're good looking? That's what you want to create for her. The fact that you think she's lovely to look at is a significant turn-on. Here's how to communicate it without going overboard:


Say ""Hey, pretty lady"" or ""Hello, beautiful"" when you greet her. It's simple and short, but direct (and potentially patronising - use with caution).
Pay her a compliment. Lower the volume and tone of your voice slightly, and say something like ""You look amazing today"" or ""I love your eyes.""

, Be the person who's honestly kind, a person who respects her and thinks she's more beautiful than the most picturesque sunset. Be the person who works hard and makes it easier for her to work hard, by helping to shoulder her burdens. This will all mostly keep you from turning her off!

, Some girls like a guy who is nervous and even klutzy around her, but don't overdo it. If the girl is shy, be confident; if the girl is confident, feel free to act somewhat shy. Keep your shoulders straight and your chin high, and don't be afraid to look her in the eyes. You're communicating through your body language that you're strong, brave, and worthy of her attention.

, Shower, put on deodorant, shave, brush your teeth and wear clean clothes. If you're feeling up to it, you can also do your hair and put on a light spray of cologne. Knowing that you're at your physical best will help you act confident and in-charge.

, Save the dirty jokes and discussions of bodily functions for your guy friends. When you're with the girl you like, be polite. Use good table manners, hold the door open for her, and say please and thank you. Good manners aren't necessarily attractive, but bad manners are definitely unattractive, so play it safe.

, You can do these in passing, at the end of a date, while you're watching a movie, whenever — the point is that they don't have to be saved for when you're already making out. They can, however, indicate that you're interested in doing a little more.

, Ears are an erogenous zone for both sexes, and the light pressure of your breath will probably feel good. Saying the right things will also turn her on. Try something like: ""I couldn't stop thinking about you today"".

, Lightly brush the back of your fingers over the side of her face. Bonus points if you can lock eyes with her at the same time.

, You can gently run your thumb over her hairline if your arm is already around her shoulders, or offer to give her a neck rub. Keep your motions slow and light.

, Always be confident to make the first move; hold her hand. If you're holding hands, lightly stroke the inside of her wrist or her palm. A few slow kisses on the inside of the wrist could work, too.

, The scalp is a sensitive area for most people, and the light (repeat: light, not hard) tugging that comes from you playing with her hair will feel nice. Run your fingers through it, twirl it, or stroke it.

, If you're fairly sure it won't be unwelcome, try laying a hand on the top of her thigh. This works best if you're both sitting down. Let it rest there lightly. If she seems receptive, you can try slowly moving your thumb back and forth over her leg, keeping the rest of your hand where it is.

, If it's done right, a kiss can be the most effective way of turning a girl on. Keep your breath fresh with some gum or mouthwash and keep your lips loose. Tight, puckered lips is how you kiss your grandma! You should also keep the tongue action delicate (at first). The motions should be light, soft and alternate between fast and slow.


Know where to put your hands. The back of her neck, the sides of her face, or around her waist are all good areas for your hands to rest during a kiss.

, If you touch a girl in certain areas without her consent, it is sexual assault. A simple ""Is this OK?"" is enough. If she says yes, you're all clear; if she says no, stop immediately.

, Many girls are way more sexual than you, potentially. Give them credit for that and there's nothing wrong with telling them how much you want them (once you've gotten your foot in the door a bit). This actually turns them on! Think about it: you feel turned on when you feel desirable too. Don't be really gross about it but don't be afraid to tell them how sexy you think they are and how you can't wait to get them in bed.

, If you tried some of the suggestions above and she seemed receptive, here are some more intimate areas you can work with, using light touches and soft, slow kisses.


Neck, throat, collarbones and shoulders
Feet and ankles
The small of her back (toward the bottom of the spine)
Back of the knees
Inner thighs
Ears
The inside of her upper arm

, If you find an area where she likes to be touched, don't overuse it. Instead, back away from it for a while and slowly make your way back, touching everything around and up to it. The anticipation will make it more intense when you finally do touch her.

, Leaving before the other person gets bored is a good rule for most social interactions, but it's particularly important here. If you break off contact while she's still interested, you'll be on her mind constantly.

, Because many girls take longer to warm up, repeated...friction can cause skin to become sensitive or even painful. Consider getting a quality, water-soluble lubricant to keep everything slick and sexy-feeling if you plan on some prolonged fun times, but, for most girls additional lubrication shouldn't be required if they are turned on. Don't forget that a lack of natural lubrication can be a sign that your girl isn't turned on-at all! This goes for your lips too!

, Take your finger and run it very lightly around the edge of your lips. Do you feel that? There's some very sensitive skin around the edge of the mouth. Kiss her just at the corner of the mouth and deny her a proper kiss for a few minutes (no matter how much she tries). You'll drive her crazy.

, The neck and inner thighs tend to be the obvious spots. So obvious, in fact, that we forget how sensitive other parts of the body are. If you want to get her writhing, trail some kisses along the side of her ribs (that spot that's so easy to tickle), the curve of her stomach just past where her abs are, and the protruding bit of her hip bone (usually found just above or just below the waistband).

, Don't undress her too fast and when you do undress her, make it a part of the experience, rather than just a hurdle. Girls spend a lot of time making themselves look nice. When you just rip everything off without appreciating it, it's like you got handed a pristinely wrapped present and didn't even care.

, You don't have to go wild, but a blindfold or tying her hands back with a silk scarf can force her to focus on what she's feeling. Just make sure she consents!

, If you really want to get serious, one of the better ways to really physically turn her on is to make use of her anatomy. Get a good primer on female anatomy and start experimenting. The clitoris is your friend. Find it. Master it. But don't neglect all of the other sensitive areas around it! Good luck

Try starting over.,
Be open-minded.,
Do something really nice for your date.,
Be laid back.,
Find the humor in the situation.,
End it early.,
Flirt with other people.,
Boost your own self-esteem.",How to Survive a Bad Date," If you're botching up left and right, ask your date if you can start over. If you're willing to show your human side and to acknowledge that you've mucked up, it can be a genuine moment of vulnerability that endears you to your date. At least give it a go, as doing so will probably relieve your date, as well, who was probably getting worried that you're naturally like this!


Say something like: ""I'm sorry, I'm really nervous, and I'm not being myself. Can I have a do-over?"" Then take a deep breath and forget whatever you did that made you feel embarrassed, and start over.;
, If your date isn't what - or who - you expected, that's not necessarily bad. Are you irritated that he showed up wearing sweatpants and took you to Taco Bell? Maybe he's saving up to buy a house, and maybe he has an amazing sense of humor. Maybe she's gloriously unpretentious. Are you turned off by hi constant chattering? Maybe she's just nervous, possibly because she genuinely likes you. Does your date seem a little creepy or awkward? Who knows? Maybe your date is autistic, nervous, shy, or simply clueless about what to do on a date. In other words, unless your date is being outright rude, don't be too quick to write them off.


Try using open-ended questions to get them to talk about themselves more, especially where they seem nervous about talking. Listen attentively and smile a lot.






Keep in mind that it might be something you've said that your date is too polite to point out. For example, if you've aired strong opinions about sensitive issues (really a no-no for first dates), you might have unwittingly insulted his or her own beliefs without realizing. Tread with care!







, Instead of focusing on how bad you're feeling, target your fears or worries into trying to ensure that your date is having a good time, even if you're doing it for selfish reasons. It'll take the focus off you and your negative thinking, and who knows, it might even brighten up the outlook for future dates.


Rush out and buy or pick a bunch a flowers. Excuse yourself by saying you need a bit of fresh air or a bathroom break. Naturally, you'll need a florist handy; even better if the two of you happen to be walking by one as you can just do this on on the spur of the moment.






Offer to do something for your date if he or she has just spent most of the date complaining about it. For example, if your date keeps going on about having to care for a sibling or has a broken car, offer to babysit or repair the car for them. That will take away the reason for complaining and could even steer the rest of the dating conversation in a whole new direction.






Hold open doors, lay your coat down over the mud for her to walk on, let your date pick the best seat or the movie, etc. You get the drift...







, So you're on a bad date. It's not the end of the world. It's probably just a few hours out of your life. Why not try just relaxing, and going with the flow? Whatever it is that you're doing, try to enjoy it. If you're eating, for example, focus on the food, instead of on how annoying your date is. Even though every bone in your body is telling you that this person isn't the one, see it as a situation where at least the two of you had a chance to meet and exchange views and relish the reality that it isn't for long.

, It helps to maintain a sense of perspective and humor, as famously summed up by Groucho Marx when he once announced: I've had a wonderful evening - but this wasn't it. And perhaps being funny can lighten the tension that has been causing everything to go wrong so far; try a few laughs on for size.


Pay attention to every detail of what is going wrong in your date, so you can tell your friends and you can all laugh over the date escapades tomorrow. Come up with amusing metaphors for how dreadful, tiring, cheap, etc., the date situation is turning out to be (focus on finding the humor in the situation, rather than at the expense of your fellow human being). Imagine you're a stand-up comedian, relating the awfulness of the situation to an audience.






Remember your karma. It's all very well to be condescending about your date but usually it's just a case that the two of you are not made for one another. It doesn't mean he or she is any less a person than you. It just means that you're incompatible, so keep your sense of humor light-hearted and compassionate, and focus it on the date itself and not on judging the person whom you barely know anyway. The purpose of sensing incompatibility is to ensure you don't make a daft choice for your lifelong mate, not for making a laughingstock out of him or her.







, If, for whatever reason, you know you're not interested in dating this person anymore, the best thing to do is to end it. It may feel uncomfortable or cruel, but it's not kind to give someone a pity date, either (especially if they're paying). Say something like ""Look, I'm really sorry, but I don't want to waste your time. For some reason, this isn't clicking for me. Do you mind if we cut this short?"" Or, you can lie and pretend you feel sick, or have an emergency to tend to. If you don't have the courage to bail, though...


If your date is being rude, lewd, or even harassing you, don't stand for it. Be assertive and inform your date that their attitude is not acceptable. Let your date know that you're not someone who will put up with such behavior, and leave.






If you're feeling really chicken, ring your friend from the bathroom. Tell him or her that your date is going really badly and ask your friend to get you out, fast. There are several possible scenarios here:






Have your friend drop by, ""accidentally"".Your friend can either turn up pretending to already be drunk, or can quickly pretend to get drunk once with the two of you. Once he or she is seriously pretend drunk, your friend can confess to a terrible recent upset that has your friend losing the plot and needing to be taken home by you, your friend's knight or dame in shining armor. This one tends to work best between females!
Have your friend call you back in a few minutes with a ""family emergency"" that you just must attend to immediately.
Have your friend arrive and simply take over the conversation, boring your date to death while you listen rapt. Your date will soon make motions to go home and you can say simply ""Oh I'd love to stay a little longer with X. I can call you a taxi if you'd like.""



, You don't have to wait for this date to end before you start shopping for a new one! And who knows? Maybe someone you cross paths with while on this date will end up being ""the one"" and you'll have an interesting story to tell when people ask how you met!


Realize that flirting in front of your date is pretty mean and devastating. It's the ultimate ego-blow. Unless you're feeling really mean or you're feeling unsafe or vulnerable around your date, at least try to wait until he or she has left the scene before you start flirting.







, No matter whose fault it was that the date went badly, don't take it out on yourself. What has happened has passed and it's a lesson about dating, not a reflection on your own worthiness.


Think things such as ""Well, at least I... .
Congratulate yourself on being a good judge of character for not allowing yourself to get entangled with someone who isn't right for you. Early exits leave the least debris.
Congratulate yourself for not being a people pleaser. Congratulate yourself twice for not succumbing to sleeping with them on a first date to ""try to make things right"".
Things will look brighter in the morning. And a month or year from now, it'll be but a memory. And most importantly, you're still free to look for Mr or Ms Right now...

Get busy doing other things.,
Call other people once in a while.,
Know that it's OK to be single.,
Work on your self esteem.,
Learn to trust.,
Reap the benefits of being independent.,
Understand that the human mind is inherently needy.",How to Stop Being Needy2," People who are busy simply don't have enough time to be needy; they're always preoccupied with other things, and guess what? Those other things are what make people more interesting friends and romantic partners. If you have nothing better to do than to wait for someone to call or write back, then you're probably bored (and you know what they say - if you're bored, you're boring). What are you waiting for?


Widen your scope. Go volunteer. Learn to dance. Go for a run. Learn to oil paint. Join a club. Put yourself out there, apply yourself, and have fun! All your worries will fall away, and if and when the person gets in touch, it'll be a delightful surprise, not a frantic relief!

, Focusing your life around just one person isn't good for your mental health or self-esteem. Call other people in your group of friends instead of pouring all your energy into one person! Get some people together to go to a movie or out to dinner, and don't spend the whole time worrying about that person. Enjoy all the other personalities that fill your life - you have room for more than one friend.

, Many people remain single and still enjoy their life to the fullest. They have freedom and fun, and in many cases they are just as happy as people in a relationship. The deeper truth is that having a relationship is a want, not a need. The problem comes when you make it a need and start believing that you can't survive without it.


Try this exercise: when a needy thought comes into your head, repeat a mantra to yourself. Say ""I am strong,"" or ""I have everything I need."" Repeat something in your head that helps you feel like a whole person who doesn't need anyone else to live.
Listening to music and watching movies about freedom and strength can also help.

, Odds are, if you struggle with neediness, you're probably a little lacking in the self-esteem department. You might be looking for someone to make you feel better about yourself, but the fact is that you are the only person who can really do that. You shouldn't base your happiness on someone else. Sure, it's okay for someone to make you happy, but if they're your only source of happiness, you might become angry or sad whenever they're not around, and that can be very demanding for the other person! It makes them feel guilty, obligated and eventually, resentful towards you.


One way to get rid of neediness is to prove to yourself that you don't need anyone by doing things by yourself, or being single, for an extended period of time, until you feel confident. Act like you want a best friend or significant other, but you definitely don't need them.
Try not to seek out a new relationship until you're sure you won't fall into the same old patterns.

, Once you sort out what's going on inside, you can deal with any issues you might have relating to other people. Neediness is often associated with a shortage of trust, and sometimes a fear of abandonment. When you find yourself doubting someone's feelings for you, or their loyalty, ask yourself why you don't trust them. Is it because they did something questionable? Or is it because someone in your past hurt you, and now you think this new person is going to do the same thing?


If it's the latter, then remind yourself that it's not really fair to judge one person by another person's actions, is it?
If you really care for this person, and they've earned your trust, give it to them.

, Being secure and non-needy makes you more attractive. It's like a trick: the more secure and non-needy you genuinely are, the more attractive you become. Once you're really independent, you'll know it. You'll be confident enough to handle relationships without worrying excessively about what the other person thinks. You'll cherish your alone time as much as your time with the person you love.

, Our mind is pretty hyperactive as it always wants to do or acquire something and when you don't have something to do that's when you feel needy or bored or frustrated. It is therefore a pragmatic practice to channel that neediness/hyperactivity into activities that you enjoy, such as seeking new activities, following your passions, relationships etc, help in dealing with neediness, but temporarily. People who seem non-needy are simply acting out their mind's activeness constructively and/or creatively in other areas of life; or they have their want or need satisfied through another person. Consequently, when you meet them, they seem non-needy and attractive.


For example: People who have good friends don't seem to be needy, especially when it comes to making new friends, because they already have that aspect of 'want' satisfied. Another example would be that people who enjoy their job come across as non-needy, especially while on the job because they are channeling their mind's hyperactivity through their job. Similarly, if a guy is in a good relationship, he doesn't feel needy in front of other girls because he's already getting that 'want' satisfied from another person. As a result, he seems pretty non-needy and that's the reason other people feel attracted to him. It's a researched fact that guys who are already in a relationship are attractive to others.
What's the commonality in all of the above? They are all fleeting external factors. Which means remove that 'external factor' and the mind will become needy again, at least in that aspect. For example: moving to another city away from your friends, losing your job, breaking up with your partner etc.
This does not mean not to seek activities, go out with friends, have a relationship etc. In fact, these are pragmatic ways to channel the mind's hyperactivity/neediness, and can be part of the journey to become truly non-needy; but ultimately, each person has their own journey.
True non-neediness comes when you stop seeking fulfillment externally because you realize that none of the fleeting external factors can satisfy you. You may continue to follow your passions, hang out with friends, relationships etc, just because you enjoy them; but you won't seek fulfillment in them. You become simple and humble, like an ocean. ""All streams flow to the sea because its lower than they are, humility gives it its power"". Tao Te Ching.
If you are feeling uncertain, congratulations.

Forget everything you think you know about cougars.,

Be “young.” If you are trying to attract an older woman, don’t get stuck on the idea that you need to act like a man their age might act.,
Be honest about who you are.,
Be reliable and uncomplicated.",How to Know if a Woman is a Cougar," In fact, forget the term all together. If you are interested in dating and/or having a romantic encounter with an older woman, you’ll need to treat her like a human being — not some sexist stereotype of how a sexually active older woman looks and behaves.;
, The generally accepted age group for cougars is 40-plus; however, some people go as low as 35 in their definition. With new creams and procedures available, many men and women are able to look much younger than they are. Some things you can look for, which apply to both sexes:Dry, dull and/or thinning hair: both men and women experience a decrease in the quality of their hair as they get older. You might notice that an older woman has brittle-looking hair that lacks the shine and fullness of younger people. Her hair might also be dyed to cover grey hairs.Sparse eyebrows and eyelashes: as we age, our hormones drop and hair growth slows, which can make our eyebrows and eyelashes less lush. Some women might opt for pencilled or tattooed eyebrows, and eyelash extensions — so it still might be difficult to judge their age based on these factors alone.
Thinner lips and eroded tooth enamel: our lips wrinkle and thin with age, and our teeth wear down and erode. You might notice thin lines around an older woman’s mouth, thinner lips (maybe partly hidden with lipliner), and duller or translucent teeth.
Thin skin: as men and women get older, the smooth skin on their necks gain ridges and wrinkles — unless they use Botox or have a face-lifts, that is. Thin skin will also be apparent on the hands, making veins, knuckles, and tendons more visible.
Dry and saggy knees and elbows: with age the skin around our knees and elbows begins to dry and sag around the joints. The skin around the elbows in particular can become darker and much drier than the surrounding skin.

, Evolutionary psychology has shown that when evaluating women’s desirability, physical attractiveness is a more important factor than it is in evaluating men’s desirability.This means that while less attractive men might still be desirable based on their intelligence, humor, income, etc., women are still largely judged on how they look. For this reason, it makes sense that with age, a woman might amp up her makeup routine to try to hide the signs of aging that will make her less desirable.


You might notice an older woman wearing more foundation and structuring creams and shades to help give her face a smooth, contoured look.
She might also be more likely to wear lipliner to make her lips look fuller, a brow pencil to fill in her eyebrows, and blush to make her cheeks look more youthful and rosy.

Contouring is a popular makeup technique right now, used by women in all age groups, from their teens upward.

, The comical cougar stereotype is of a woman wearing clothes that are much too young, and often too tight, for her — usually in tacky fabrics such as animal print. The reality is that women of any age can dress in a tasteless and unflattering manner.


How a woman dresses — regardless of her age — depends largely upon her own personal sense of style.
While women of all ages wear push-up bras, older women may find them even more useful as their breasts will sag with age.

, In general, the older a woman gets, the better she knows herself and what she likes, and the more confident she becomes. Some signs that she is confident:Good posture: whether sitting or standing, a person with good self-confidence will likely have a straight back and a head that is well-balanced on the neck, with the chin pointed neither too high nor too low.
Relaxed: a person with good self-confidence will likely seem relaxed in most situations, perhaps looking around the room with an easy smile, or just seeming generally calm and at peace with herself. She won’t be very fidgety.
Eye contact: confident people make eye contact and maintain it in social interactions. That said, there's a difference between maintaining eye contact and staring intimidatingly at someone: looking someone in the eye roughly 60% of the time you are talking to them is a good rule of thumb.

, Whether it’s just sex or a long-term relationship, knowing what you want will help you figure out your best course of action to get it. It’s also important to be honest with the woman about what you want — don’t act like you want a relationship if all you want is sex. Women enjoy sex too; she might be fine with some no-strings-attached fun.


Some questions to consider: Is it sexual — a checkmark on your bucket list? Or, are you interested in something long-term, with someone who is more mature than your previous partners? Perhaps you have someone specific in mind already, and are wondering how you can get her to notice you.
If you just want sex with an older woman, for example, your best bet might be dating sites geared specifically toward older women seeking younger men, and vice versa. There are even cruises devoted to connecting older women with younger men.Dating sites are also a good option if you are seeking a longer-term relationship with an older woman. Again, just be clear about your intentions from the beginning.
Women in and over the age of 40 have lives too; this means that you can meet them literally anywhere — from the gym to a boating club, to an acting class, or even in your local grocery store. Spaces are shared interest are great for meeting people in general, no matter your age.

, Sure, some older women might fit the traditional “cougar” stereotype, but just as many — if not more — will not. As with all people, desires and behaviour differ depending on the individual. When approaching an older woman for romantic purposes, you’ll do well to forget the “cougar” stereotype and simply treat her with the same respect and consideration that you would treat anyone else.


Some websites would have you believe that there are specific types of cougar: the moneyed cougar (or sugar mama), the angry cougar, the sweet cougar; alpha versus beta cougars.While there is often some truth in stereotypes, you’re better off getting to know the individual woman rather than trying to lock her into some predefined, narrow-minded, and generally unflattering idea of how a mature woman behaves.

, If you’re interested in a mature woman, let her know. How you show you’re interested will vary depending on your own situation — including where you meet the woman and how well you already know her.


If you meet a woman at the bar, you might show your interest by smiling at her and seeing if she smiles back. Wait to see if she keeps looking back at you; if she does, this might be a sign that she’s interested. You could then approach her and ask to buy her a drink.
If you are interested in a woman who is in the same running club as you, your tactic would be different. You might gauge her interest by starting a conversation with her after the run — it doesn’t have to be anything too serious; small talk about the weather and the run will do to begin with.

, If you approach a mature woman and she rejects you, don’t be a jerk about it. It’s okay to be disappointed and to even express your disappointment in a polite or witty manner; it’s not okay to call her names or threaten her.


Do: “I’m devastated, but if you change your mind, I’ll be over there!”
Don’t: “Are you kidding me? You’re lucky to have a young guy like me show interest in you!”

, Many women in their 40s admit to seeking younger men because they are more open-minded, adventurous, and romantic.


When going out on dates, be adventurous and willing to try new things. Share your interests with her, and learn about her interests too. As with any relationship, take pleasure in learning and growing together.
You’ll also benefit from being adventurous and open-minded in the bedroom. Chances are, she’ll be clear about what she likes, so it’s important that you’re willing to listen and possibly follow instructions.

, If a mature woman says that her last relationship ended because her partner was an unromantic, stubborn workaholic, and you know that you’re approaching a critical time in your career where you will need to prioritize work over everything else, it might not be the best time to get into a relationship with this woman.

, Most older women (and men) have had enough relationships to know what works and what doesn’t; they’re not interested in playing games. Cancelling plans at the last minute and “forgetting” to call for days to weeks might have been tolerated by younger women, but more mature women will likely not put up with this behaviour."

If you're shy or sly, combine the arm sneak with another movement, so that it all appears seamless.,

Have courage but don't go over the top.",How to Sneak Your Arm Around Your Date1," While putting your arm around your date isn’t an overly invasive gesture, it usually signals that you're interested in a romantic, more deeply connected relationship. Before sneaking your arm around, be totally sure that you're ready to send out these signals! If it's your first date, it might move things too quickly, especially if you're serious about getting to know one another properly. And if you feel that you don't have romantic feelings toward your date after all, but would like to stay in the ""friend zone"", avoid the arm sneak altogether, as it'll send out the wrong signals and isn't fair to your date.;
, Are you getting signals that your date wants to hold hands or get cozy? If you can read your date, you may see your date's own strong signals that he or she wouldn’t mind you getting closer for an intimate snuggle. This can help you pluck up the courage needed!

, There are wrong times (such as when he's slurping his linguine with clam sauce or she's trying on a pair of shoes) and there are right times to sneak your arm around your date. Choose an intimate moment and exercise patience––the right time will present itself in due course. Perfect arm-sneaking times include:


At the movies during a romantic, sad or scary point in the film. This classic arm-sneaking territory is so well used precisely because it contains all the necessary elements––darkness, close proximity, potential need for comfort during a scary or hairy moment in a film, comfortableness of the seating, and general inability to look at each other, something that could otherwise break the arm hold spell. Just be careful not to send out the wrong signal (such as sneaking an arm around during an explicit sex scene) or spoiling the climax of an action scene with a distracting arm sneak. Emotional scenes or scary scenes are usually good bets.
Walking down the street. If you're walking closely together and talking, this can serve as an ideal moment to sneak an arm around your date. Time it to coincide with a meaningful or caring discussion; avoid any moment that's too mundane or involves a heated discussion about politics. A good moment is when you're both expressing awe at the beauty of the day or the prettiness of the flowers along the path.
When seated together at drinks or a party. Depending on where you're sitting, a dirty martini or a plate of tapas might just present the ideal moment for sliding your arm around your honey. Another opportunity might be during special announcements or when making a toast––after speaking, slide your arm behind your date's back or shoulders in a friendly gesture of celebration.

, Arm sneaking isn't about struggling, strangling or finding yourself dangling! Make sure you're in a comfortable spot and close enough to your partner. Avoid any arm sneaking if there's a risk you might become unbalanced and end up using your date as support! The best position is to be side by side, so aim for some shoulder to shoulder closeness.

, For example, offer your jacket to your date if it's cold and then simply leave your arm there after placing the jacket on. Or talk and move at the same time, such as saying ""You know that I find you so adorable"", while sliding your arm around his or her back at the same time. Or go window shopping together and as your date is peering at something closely, sidle up and mention how interesting the items in the window appear, while at the same time sneaking your arm around your date's back.

, Try this on for size: Ask your date ""If you were a pirate, would you have a parrot on this shoulder (point to the shoulder closest to you), or this shoulder (point the shoulder furthest from you)?"" When your hand reaches the shoulder furthest from you, casually just leave your hand there, with the arm draped around your date's back. Done!


This can get even more intimate… Try asking: ""If you were Casanova, would you kiss someone on this cheek, or on this cheek…"" You get the drift!

, If you're certain that it's the right time and place, then go with your instinct and trust that your date is ready for the arm sneak. On the other hand, if your date shrinks back, asks that you kindly remove your arm or looks horrified, then it's either too soon or it's never going to happen. Be polite and remove your arm with a short apology and simply move on by suggesting that the two of you do something else. The implications of the response may be something you need to reflect on, and you may even need to discuss the future of your relationship after some reflection.

Face-to-face is ideal for difficult conversations. Humans evolved to pick up on non-verbal cues and signals that are reassuring during difficult conversations. An impromptu pat on the shoulder, for example, can reassure someone he or she is essentially lovable even if this one relationship did not work out. A look of sadness on your face can help your partner see you truly care about his or her feelings, despite the fact you feel the relationship should end.If possible, choose to have the talk at a place where your significant other feels comfortable. Choose to stop by his or her apartment to talk, for example. It may feel uncomfortable for you but giving someone a slight sense of power during a difficult conversation can help him or her digest bad news.If you anticipate a long conversation, try to choose a time where the conversation will not be cut short by external factors. Do not, for example, break up with your longterm boyfriend an hour before he has to leave for work. Instead, choose to stop by his place shortly after dinner on a weeknight. This will allow any lingering loose threads to be addressed.;
, If you're letting someone down easy, you need to take full responsibility for your decision. Oftentimes, people feel it will be easier if their partner initiates the breakup. However, you are the one whose feelings have changed. It's your responsibility to start the breakup conversation. Trying to lead your partner to the conclusion, that you want to break up, through subtle cues is not only dishonest it can be confusing. Your partner may not get the message and begin to question him or herself as you subtly pull away.For example, if you become less physically affectionate in order to show your partner you're losing interest your partner might question his or her own attractiveness. If you want to let someone down easy, you need to take full responsibility of your decision.

, It's best to be honest when letting someone down. While you do not have to go over every single reason you want out, it's important to be direct about your expectations. Make it clear you want to end the relationship and give your partner a brief explanation as to why.


The essential message that most breakups boil down to is, ""You're not what I'm looking for."" It's perfectly okay to express this. This will allow the recipient to have a sense of closure as he or she will understand your reasoning. It's okay to gently say something like, ""I'm sorry, but I'm not in love with you anymore. I need something different right now and I think we should go our separate ways."" If it's a less serious relationship, you can keep the statement briefer. Something like, ""Sorry, but I'm not feeling a significant spark between us. I think we would be better off friends.""Honesty is important, but it does not have to be brutal. It's not a good idea to go over your partner's past mistakes or current pitfalls. If you're leaving because you're no longer attracted to your partner, for example, this might be best unsaid. If you have lingering feelings of resentment over past arguments, it may feel cathartic to let this out. However, this is painful for your partner to hear. If you want to let someone down easy, keep your statements for ending the relationship general and do not go into excessive details about your partner's flaws or drawbacks as a match., Once again, while it's great to be honest you should also be direct. You are not doing your partner any good by beating around the bush and avoiding the subject at hand. Start the conversation off with a direct declaration of what you want, something like, ""I wanted to talk to you because I don't feel this relationship is working out."" From there, try to keep the conversation brief.


Letting someone down can be difficult but remaining calm and collected is important. This way, you'll be able to get your words out in a concise manner. Becoming overly emotional can result in confusing rambling, obscuring the message at hand. Try to spend some time emotionally preparing for the conversation by running over a script in your head.You could write down some of what you plan to say. While memorizing a speech may not be the best route, this can make you come off as cold, having some idea of what you can to say can help you focus. Practice your words a few times before the confrontation., Offering some kind of consolation at the end of a relationship can help reduce the sting of the blow. If possible, offer friendship to your ex. Say something like, ""I hope we can stay friends."" However, keep in mind many people struggle staying friends, especially in the direct wake of a breakup. If you do not think you can reasonably remain friends with someone, do not make the offer., When letting someone down easy, it's important to avoid anything your ex might find patronizing or insulting. Cliches, such as ""It's not you, it's me,"" can feel dishonest. Instead, express yourself directly and abandon cliche language. Speaking to your own personal experience is best when letting someone down easy., You may feel some anger and resentment if you're choosing to end a relationship. It can tempting to attribute blame to your ex, especially if he or she hurt you. However, if you want to let your ex down easy playing the blame game is not a good idea.


Avoiding negativity of any kind is one of the best ways to spare someone's feelings. Going over past mistakes or resentments can spur an argument, resulting in an unclean and unpleasant breakup.If you suspect your partner may not take the breakup well, keep in mind he or she may try to blame you. Avoid being sucked into a negative conversation. If your partner tries to put you down for your actions, counter with something like, ""I'm sorry you feel that way but it doesn't change my decision."", Social media can be particularly toxic in the wake of a breakup. If you want to let your ex down easy, avoid positing about the breakup online. Even accounts you think he or she might not access to could potentially discovered. While many find social media cathartic when coping with a breakup, keep in mind your ex's feelings may be hurt by what you choose to post. It may also be a good idea to stop following your ex on any social media platforms. During a breakup, you'll need time to cultivate some space between you and your partner to help you move on. Severing the social media tie a bit can help.

, You can help yourself and your ex cope by choosing to focus on the positive. Towards the end of the breakup conversation, try to focus on mutual benefit.


Emphasize all the good things your partner has done for you. Make sure she leaves the conversation feeling like the relationship was worthwhile even if it did not work out. Say something like, ""You really made me feel good about myself and pushed me to be a kinder, more empathetic person. I will always be grateful for that.""Encourage gratitude. While acknowledge it may take some time, encourage your partner to cherish the good times you had together. Relationships are primarily social exchanges and people have a natural tendency to search for their benefits. Your partner will appreciate you helping him or her seek positives even as the relationship ends., As previously stated, it can be helpful to leave the door open for friendship. However, you do not want to give mixed messages. Be honest about what kind of contact you want to have with your ex. If you need some space before you can work on establishing a friendship, for example, say so. Do not try to force friendly meetings prematurely, as this can confuse you and your ex. You will need time and space before you're able to see one another without romantic attachments and associations., You will likely run into your ex at some point in the future. Be cordial and friendly during any encounters you might have. Remain emotionally prepared. Keep in mind as you go to work, school, and run errands you may run into your ex. This can help you stay calm and collected during the encounter.

, When in love, many people convince themselves the person they're with is their one true love. However, you need to let those feelings go after a breakup. In reality, there are many people with whom you would be potentially compatible. You will likely find someone else in the future, despite what you may be feeling in the present moment. Allow yourself to accept the fact the relationship ended for a reason and you will find someone else in the future., If not, then don't end things. You need to mentally consider this as a break-up. Don't try and let someone down easy as an excuse to ""keep your options open."" Either you break up or you don't. Playing games with someone's emotions isn't fair or gentle.


If you hope that you can get them to break up with you, then don't try and let them down gently. You can't expect them to do the work for you -- you need to end things yourself.
If they don't pick up on the hints or being gentle doesn't work, you need to be ready to step in and end the relationship firmly.

, Your goals when splitting away from someone are important. If you don't want to see someone again, then you should just end the relationship quickly and kindly. If you're just trying to slow thing down a bit, a gentle let down is more appropriate.


A gentle let down can give someone the impression that you may want to rekindle things later in life. If you don't want this, end it quickly.
If you're being gentle because you are worried about your safety, just end things quickly. Don't worry about being gentle. If you're worried about their reaction, bring a trusted friend along.
If you've had some disagreements lately and just need some space, you should let them down gently, allowing you to resume friendship when the dust has settled.

, All relationships have ups and downs, and it is easy to forget about the good times when you're in the bad. If you're trying to let her down because you've hit a rough patch, ask yourself if you really dislike her or just dislike your current state.


Don't rush into this decision. Wait 2-3 weeks to see if your feelings change.
Many people like the ""gentle let down"" because it lets you change your mind later on. If you do keep changing your mind, however, you are likely in a short lull, not some relationship crisis.
If you keep having the same old fights every day, then you should consider ending it once and for all.

, While your gentle intentions are noble, and you still care for their feelings, ask yourself if you're really making things better with a protracted split. Sometimes you just need to rip the Band-Aid off. If you know that they're emotionally invested in your relationship and don't want things to end, you're not going to be gentle no matter what you do. Don't prolong this more than necessary.


If he seems distant as well, and you just don't feel the spark anymore, you should go ahead and let him down nice and gently.

, If you've realized that this isn't fair, or isn't the best way to end things, you should weigh your other options. Consider:

Remember it's just one day.",How to Handle Valentine's Day in a New Relationship," If you've only been on a date or two, it's probably best to ignore Valentine's Day altogether. Jumping on a romantic holiday may push your potential date away, so it's probably a good idea to skip it for this year.

, Think about how long you've been in the relationship, and how much you realistically expect the other person to contribute. If you think dinner and a card is reasonable, get the other person a card and ask him or her out to dinner on or near the day., One way to alleviate the stress is to simply talk to your crush about it. You can suggest keeping it low-key since you're new to the relationship, as well as make a plan for a nice dinner or an outing if you'd like.For instance, you could say, ""Our relationship is still pretty new. Why don't we keep Valentine's Day low-key? We could say no gifts, though cards are fine. Do you want to have a nice dinner together?""
Ask the other person what they think of Valentine’s Day. Some folks actually despise the holiday, referring to it as a “Hallmark” holiday. It might be a good idea to even take the other person’s temperature about how they even feel about it before pursuing a date on the day. For example, you could say, ""I know our relationship is still in the early stages, so I thought maybe we could talk about what we want to do for Valentine's Day. Are you a fan of the holiday, or do you prefer to ignore it?""
Discuss the fact that you’ve only been dating a short time and that you're both now confronted with a highly romantic holiday. Be honest about how bizarre it is to begin a new relationship as other couples are declaring their love from the rooftops. Let the other person know that you get the fact that both of you may not be ready just yet for poems and love songs. As an example, you could say, ""So, Valentine's Day is coming up. I don't really know how to treat it since we haven't been dating very long. What do you think we should do? I know we're probably not ready for poems or love songs, haha, but I thought I would bring it up.""
One option is agreeing to ignore Valentine's Day altogether if you're both happy with that option.

, If you both want different things, try to make a compromise. For instance, if your new crush prefers something fancy, but you'd prefer to keep it low-key, maybe you could settle for a fancy home-cooked dinner. If you like to do it up big, but your crush seems uncomfortable with that, try to tone it down a bit. If your new crush is a someone who gets you, you should be able to find a reasonable compromise.

, At this point in the game, you don't want to be too extravagant, as you can scare the other person off. A diamond necklace is over-the-top and too much if the relationship is still new. However, flowers or a nice box of candy may go over well.Definitely keep it under $50 if you've only been dating a month or two.Also, it's a good idea to skip any type of sexy or sexual gift (such as lingerie) this early in the relationship. You don't want to scare the person off.

, You may not want to get too mushy at this point, but a little mushiness mixed with some humor is fine. For instance, you may not want to pick a card that says ""I'll love you forever!"" but a whimsical card that says ""I think you're cute!"" or ""You make my heart go pitter-patter!"" would work better.

, Another option is to bake your new crush a sweet treat. A batch of brownies or cookies is thoughtful, but you're not throwing a huge amount of money at the person.

, This gift is personal, as you're giving a bit of yourself to the other person. However, it's not so personal that you'll drive the other person away. It's sweet and thoughtful, but not over-the-top. Just be sure you know your crush's preferred method of reading books (digital or book form) or watching movies. As an added bonus, you could watch the movie together on Valentine's Day.Don't forget to add a note in the cover if you give a book, including why you enjoy it. It can act as card and gift.

, Flowers, candy, and wine are always good gifts, but try to do it with a bit of a twist. For instance, if you get flowers, consider getting a pretty potted plant that will continue to bloom or a small pot of succulents. If you know his or her favorite candy or wine, wrap it up in a pretty package., A nice, no-pressure event for Valentine's Day could be going to have drinks. If alcohol isn't your thing, you could get coffee instead. That way, you don't have the pressure of creating a monumentally romantic evening., If you're far enough along in your relationship that you want more than just drinks, try cooking a meal for your lover. It's not as big an expenditure as a fancy restaurant, but it still shows you're thinking about the person.

, If the relationship is still new, maybe you want to acknowledge the holiday somehow. However, with restaurants so busy on the day and lots of pressure about being in love, maybe it's best not to go out on the actual day. Instead, try going out the day before or after. That way, you still have a good time, but there's not as much pressure.

, Another low-key event is to go on a picnic in the park. That way, you don't have the pressure of going to a fancy restaurant, and you can just enjoy each others' company. Plus, you have the added bonus of swing sets if you are the playful type.

, Valentine's Day is only special because the culture acknowledges it to be, but it's really just one day out of the year. Don't worry about it too much if your relationship is new. If it's meant to last, you'll have many Valentine's Days ahead to celebrate your love, though you can also celebrate it every day you spend together."

, This is a standard, go-to move. Nothing stirs up the good kind of trouble like tickling. There are too many areas for her to hide them all and besides, you should know where they are anyway., Just like when you were little kids, it’s fun to wrestle with someone you care about or love.

Tell him why you appreciate him.This may seem obvious, and you may think it is obvious to your partner, but it certainly won’t hurt to explain the reasons why you appreciate him.It may seem silly, but the little things can make all the difference in a relationship.,
Give him compliments.,
Become aware of the little things your boyfriend does for you.,
Ask him about his day/week.When you see your boyfriend (either when he comes home or when you see him), ask him to tell you about his day/week.",How to Appreciate Your Boyfriend2,"


For example, maybe many of your past boyfriends were always late for dates with you, but your current boyfriend is always on time. Explain to him how good it makes you feel when he shows up on time, and how much you appreciate it.

, Find something that you really enjoy in your partner. It can be something physical, something about his personality, or some other talent he may have. Tell him how nice you find that quality.For example, if you find his eyes to be very handsome, tell him that. Tell him what it is that you like about them.
You can also do this with something he is wearing. For example, if there is a shirt that he looks particularly handsome in, tell him!
When giving compliments, be sincere! This means not over-doing too! While it’s nice to compliment often receiving the same compliment from the same person over and over is tiresome and can even seem insincere. Try to find different aspects of your boyfriend to compliment.

, It’s easy to take for granted the smaller things your partner does. For example, maybe he always takes out the trash before it overflows. Acknowledge this by saying how much you appreciate that he always takes care of this so you don’t have to., Listen to what he says. Ask questions about the things he says. If he complains about a problem he is having, ask him if you can help him resolve it.

Listen to your partner.This may seem common sensical, but when your boyfriend is telling you about his day, about something that is bothering him, or even something that recently made him happy, listen to what he is telling you.Stop what you’re doing, put away any distractions (such as a cell phone) and be involved in the conversation.,
Do something unexpected.,

Look nice for your boyfriend.,
Be affectionate.",How to Appreciate Your Boyfriend3," Ask him follow-up questions, sympathize with his fears and worries, and provide physical comfort when needed. By being a good listener, he will see that he is important enough to you that you listen to what he has to say.


Believe it or not, listening is a skill that you must work to improve!
Be compassionate. If your boyfriend opens up to you about something that he is afraid of or upset about, don’t belittle him. Due to social rules, men often have a difficult time feeling vulnerable. If you belittle him when he has made himself vulnerable, it is unlikely that he will do it again.

, Make him a romantic dinner, or take him out to his favorite restaurant for no reason. Give him a massage. Plan a movie night where you watch his favorite movie. The possibilities are endless, just think of something you know he would enjoy.


The key here is to do it without needing an occasion. For example, while taking him out to dinner on his birthday is very nice, it is best to do this on a regular day. When he asks what the reason is, just explain that you wanted to do something special because he is important to you, and because you appreciate him.

, Do your best to support him in these activities, even if you don’t necessarily enjoy them or understand them.


For example, if he loves watching football, you can support him by finding out what days/times his favorite team is playing, and having the game ready for him on TV. Whatever you decide to do, don’t make him feel guilty or stupid for enjoying it.
If your boyfriend has confided in you that he wants to run a marathon, encourage him! Do some of his training with him, find out what is involved in a marathon, and discuss it with him. Attend the races he signs up for.

, However, as you spend more and more time with each other (particularly if you live together), it is likely that you will go on fewer and fewer dates. Suggest going on a date together where you can spend time reconnecting with each other.


For example, you might go to the restaurant or coffee shop where you had your first date. You can reminisce with him about how you were feeling on the first date, and your first impression of him on that date.

, If you have been with your boyfriend for a long time, you likely feel comfortable hanging out in lounge clothes, with your hair undone, and/or without makeup. This is not a bad thing, but it is also nice to make the effort to look nice for your partner too. If you are going on a date, style your hair, put on a nicer outfit, and do your makeup (if you wear it). He will notice the effort you’ve made for him.


Be practical here. If you’re going out for burgers at his favorite restaurant, you shouldn’t wear a ball gown with heavy makeup. Instead, you can wear a nice pair of jeans with a nice blouse. It is important that you style yourself according to the occasion.

, When it is appropriate, show your affection for him. Hold his hand, give him a hug, or a gentle kiss. Typically, men enjoy being affectionate just as much as women do.


If you’re in public, don’t go over the top. While what is appropriate depends on where you live, how old you are, who you’re with, etc., there are limits to what is appropriate and what he will feel comfortable with. If you want to show your affection in public, holding his hand or a quick kiss on the cheek are likely to be OK.

Seek help if you are at work.,
Handle a sext from a stranger.,
Determine how to talk to a friend.,
Do not encourage the other person's sexting.",How to Get Someone to Stop Sexting You3," People sext for many different reasons. Some sexting is consensual while other times it can be used to harass, blackmail, or victimize someone. The nature of sexting can also change. For example, you may have agreed to sext with your partner, but your partner is now threatening to post some of your photos or text messages because the two of you got into a fight or ended the relationship.Before you take any kind of action, consider the source.


The way you handle a person using sexting to blackmail you will be different than telling your partner or friend that their text messages simply make you uncomfortable.

, It might be the source of the messages, such as from a friend or acquaintance rather than from a lover, and/or it just feels too intimate for your preference. Or, it might be the content being just too lurid for your liking. Your feelings are valid. You may enjoy or dislike receiving the messages, or you may be unsure about them.Do you not like receiving the messages at all? Tell the person to stop.
Are the messages too vulgar and you would like something more discreet? Let the person know you prefer sweeter or more coded language.
How the messages make you feel will also determine how you handle the situation.

, The first step to getting someone to stop sexting you is to simply request they stop contacting you this way. It is quite possible that they really do not know that it is offending or upsetting you and most reasonable people will apologize and cease immediately. Obviously, determining how to deliver the request could be a little tricky, especially if you're trying to ask someone you like, such as a friend or boyfriend/girlfriend, to stop the sexting.


Talk to someone who you can trust to help you handle the situation. This may be a friend, family member, teacher, or school counselor.
You could also write down what you plan to say or stand in front of the mirror and practice.

, Maybe your sweetheart thinks that sexting might heat things up at home, but you're a little grossed out. Maybe your new date is using sexting as a means to seduce and perhaps even impress you. They don't know you well enough yet to realize that it's actually upsetting you (and perhaps you're too polite or confused to say otherwise).


Tell the person, ""Hey, I'm not really into sexting,"" or ""Sexting makes me really uncomfortable. I would rather you not send me messages like that.""
For a love interest, it can help to explain that you believe that intimacy should only be a face-to-face thing and that sexting feels sneaky, unreal and smutty to you.
You could also add that texting is no replacement for talking and that you just don't appreciate sexting as a substitute for direct talk.

, A co-worker or supervisor may start sexting you. Perhaps a friendly gesture in the lunchroom or a comment you made during the last staff meeting gave one of your co-workers or a casual acquaintance the wrong idea and now they've taken the liberty of sexting you. There are multiple ways to handle this.


You can tell the person to stop because maybe they just have the wrong idea.
You can also go the human resources department at your job and report this because this is considered sexual harassment.

, Have you received an inappropriate message or photo from an unknown number? Did a stranger send you something online? In this case, just block the unknown number or the sender.


It is best not to engage or respond to a stranger. Do not ask who it is or how the person got your contact information.
Engaging with an unknown person on any level may encourage them to continue.
Sometimes a person you dislike has your number. Just block them because they are probably sexting you to get on your nerves and bother you.

, Your friend might sext you as a joke or think it's not a big deal. Simply respond to your friend the next time it happens. Keep it light the first time you ask them to stop.


You could return the text or Facebook message by saying something like “Gross, no thank you!” or “My mom (spouse, kids, etc.) reads my messages, so you probably shouldn’t send me stuff like this.”
If that doesn't work, tell them in person or over the phone that sexting makes you uncomfortable and to stop doing it. If all else fails, you may have to block your friend until the message is clear.

, Have you done anything to encourage sexting? Perhaps you sent a photo of yourself in a scantily clad pose, or perhaps you said something sexy that seemed to open the doors to more sexting. If any of these things have occurred from your end, you'll need to explain that you didn't mean for it to become a regular occurrence or to become more serious than you originally intended. In the future, always think twice before sending sexy photos of yourself or sending provocative words.


Even if you have sexted with the person in the past, you always have the right to change your mind and stop sexting. Do not feel guilty if you no longer want to participate.
Don’t play along if you don't want to communicate with the person in this manner. Being forthright about your preferences at the outset of the start of sexting is best.

Talk to a parent or trusted adult.,
Get law enforcement involved.,
Talk to a victim advocate.",How to Get Someone to Stop Sexting You4," If you are unable to handle the situation on your own and do not know where to start, a parent or a trusted adult is always a good resource. Your parent is not required to report any photos or messages to law enforcement and can help you decide what to do next.Talking to your parents can be difficult and embarrassing, but remember that they love you and want the best for you.

Be honest and do not hide any of the details.

, If the behavior does not stop or the other person pursues you other ways (such as stalking, threatening or harassing), contact your local law enforcement. Some people who have been asked to stop sexting will stop. However, if the other person continues to pursue you, you may need to get the authorities involved.


Always tell the truth when you talk to law enforcement. They need to know about any messages you responded to or any explicit photos that you may have sent.

, If you feel like you are being victimized by the person sexting you, work with an advocate to help you navigate the process. An advocate can help you gather evidence, put together a safety plan, and get civil protection.

Dating, a lot of times, can be very casual, and done without any serious commitment. You can date exclusively or you can date several woman at a time and many times it's just for fun. Courting is a serious commitment you are making to get to know a woman with the intention of the relationship leading into marriage., Because courting is different from dating, it's not something that should just be done on a whim, because it's a serious step to pursue a woman. Most courtships are between a couple trying to determine if marriage is in their future, so if you aren't ready for a commitment like this, it's best to stick to dating or being single., Although courtship can seem ""old-fashioned"" or too rule based, it's an opportunity to pursue a woman without the awkwardness of wondering if you are on the same page. Maybe you're tired of dating just to date and are ready to take the next step. Courtship is a great way to do that.


You may think that a relationship that lacks a lot of physical intimacy will not be as enjoyable, but the benefit of courtship is that you can really get to know a woman without the distraction or confusion of things that typically happen when dating or hooking up with someone. Courting a woman allows you to have a lot of fun with creative ideas and know her intimately through conversation and activities together, which will be a more solid foundation for marriage., Because courtship is more serious, you don't want to jump into courting a woman before you know if she's even someone you would be romantically interested in. Hang out with her in group settings, learn about her personality and character, and decide if you are attracted to her.

, Courtship has a lot to do with family and community interaction, mostly because it's mainly prevalent in religious circles who value healthy relationships. Getting to know a woman's family will help when you decide you want to court her. Learn about her family's values and if you would be a good fit for her and she, you.Families are different, and some won't need to know you well before their daughter is courted by you, but some families place a high value on the man's participation in the family because they want to know they can trust you before they allow their daughter to spend a lot of time with you.
If you are older and the woman has already moved out of her house and is living on her own, family participation may not be as important. However, you'll want to check with her to make sure you aren't overstepping any boundaries.

, Before you begin courting a woman, you'll want to let her know you are interested in her and that you're serious about figuring out if marriage is in the future. Make sure she is on the same page as you, and ask her what her expectations are for the relationship.


Not all courtships are this serious and sometimes they are similar to dating, except they are exclusive and more serious. If you aren't ready to pursue marriage, then make sure the woman you are courting is on the same page so that there are no frustrations or confusions from either party before you begin courting.

, This can be a vital part of courting if the woman you are courting sees it as a serious commitment. Because courting often involves participation from the family or mentors, asking a woman's father if you can court her is important in gaining her family's trust and approval.


You'll probably want to make sure she is actually interested in you romantically before you ask her father, because it takes some courage to go to a girl's father and explain you are interested in her daughter, and it would be a bit embarrassing if she ended up turning you down.

, Depending on the type of courtship, you'll want to spend time with your girl in settings where you can really get to know her through good conversation and activities. Some courtships are done solely around people, meaning you would only spend time together in groups or with the family, but others are done individually, meaning you'd still likely spend time in public places like a coffee shop, but it will be just you two on the date.


Some fun date ideas that you can do in public are outdoor activities like kayaking on a lake, going on a picnic in a park, going to the movies with a group of friends, visit the local tourist areas in your town, learn a new hobby or sport, or go to a local amusement park or zoo together.

, Just because courtship often involves the mentoring and interaction of others in your relationship, doesn't mean you can't romance the woman you are courting. Come up with creative ideas for dates, compliment her, and show her you are in love with her character and personality.


Romancing a woman also has to do with the way you treat her in front of others and your desire to serve her. Some women want to do everything on their own, but one of the greatest ways to show you care for someone is to serve them. Caring for the woman you are courting by doing things for her and helping her through difficult times can be one of the most meaningful ways to communicate to a woman how you feel about her.

, Emotionally intimacy can be just as powerful as physical intimacy in a relationship, and so sometimes it requires boundaries. Before you use language like ""I love you,"" think about if you seriously mean it. You don't want to lead a woman on or make her believe you are at another stage of the relationship when in truth you aren't ready.

, If a couple is more serious about dating and pursuing marriage, they are likely more hesitant about jumping into a sexual relationship right away. Discuss with the woman you are courting what she thinks are good physical boundaries. Remember that often times in courtship commitment precedes intimacy.Some courtships don't even allow kissing, meaning the couple has decided to save their first kiss for their wedding day. Others, however, are more casual and allow physical touch throughout the relationship. Discussing this with the woman you are courting is important because you want to make sure you are on the same page. You don't want to overstep a boundary and turn her off, but you also don't want to make her wait around wondering when you are going to take the next step physically., Because some of your dates will likely be in group settings, it's important to get to know her friends, and to show the woman you are courting that you want to be a part of her life too.


This doesn't mean become best friends with her best girl friend. Get to know her friends and be amicable towards them, but understand proper boundaries. If you made best friends with her friends and the courtship ends, it could be awkward for her and for you to try to continue to pursue those friendships.

, Courtship is serious, and you'll want to have advice from wise men and women on how you should handle the relationship and if you are caring for one another well. Having a mentor or someone who cares about your relationship will also help you stay accountable and make sure you are acting on your intentions in the way that you originally communicated to the woman you are courting., One of the worst things you can do is to leave a girl wondering what you are thinking or where you stand. Make sure you have a conversation every now and then about your intentions in the relationship and where you stand emotionally. This will give her some stability in the relationship and will allow her to enjoy it without wondering what the next step will be.

, Now that you've spent time getting to know your girl, it's time to figure out if you two have a future together. Talk about what your desires are for the next years of your life. You'll want to make sure you are on the same page so that down the road you're not surprised by the way she wants to live her life. Some questions to focus on are:


Do you want to spend time focusing on your career?
Are you interested in making a high income?
Do you want to have a big family, or a family at all?
Do you want to travel or settle down in one place for a while?
How much time to do you hope to spend with your family?

, People have different desires and values they hope to instill in their future families, so discussing this is vital to figuring out if you are compatible for marriage. First, determine if you both want to have children and then talk about what you hope your family will look like.Some important things to talk about here are the number of children you hope to have, if one of you wants to stay at home with the children while the other works, if you want your children raised in a certain religion, if you are going to be more hands-off parents or very involved.
This may be a hard question to ask but make sure you talk about your view on divorce. If you feel divorce is okay but the woman you are courting does not or vice versa, this is probably a sign that you shouldn't get married. You want to make sure the woman you marry has the same values as you so that less conflict occurs during marriage.

, This may seem strange, but money and finances can be one of the biggest stressors on marriage, and it could be really helpful to learn about each other's financial habits before you get married so you can address any issues or concerns you see. You can often find these classes through local churches or organizations in the area., Hopefully some of the above topics would help you determine if you are compatible with the woman you are courting, but compatibility can be found in your personalities and character as well. If you have found during courtship that you have opposite personalities that cause you to argue a lot, or if the woman you are courting lives a certain lifestyle that you dislike, then marriage may not be the best path for you.


Even though courtship is designed with marriage in mind, not every courtship ends in marriage. If you are to the point in your relationship that you realize marriage doesn't seem right for the two of you, you'll need to break off the courtship. Have a gentle conversation explaining why you don't think things would work between you two in the future and explain that you valued the opportunity to court her. Make her see that it's not that she has all of these flaws, but that the two of you together just don't mesh well., If you've thought through and discussed any potential concerns with your partner and have decided you want to pursue marriage, the final step is to ask her father for her hand in marriage. This may seem old fashioned, but generally when courting a woman asking her father is done more as a symbolic gesture, showing him and her that you respect him and want his approval.

Try to get to know each other outside of a spiritual context, and understand how her faith influences her character. You should connect as people, first and foremost.The more honest you are about your own beliefs, the better. Even if you're not Christian, she will respond to your sincerity, and you may discover that a religious difference isn't a deal-breaker. Approach the subject of your respective beliefs directly by saying ""I understand why you believe what you do, but I have to say that I..."" or ""that's interesting. I feel that..."";
, It may be that her beliefs don't permit her to do certain things, like going out for drinks, or that her involvement in the church gives her a chance to take part in certain activities. Ask her about her interests and hobbies and see what the two of you have in common.Do things that make her feel enriched. If she's a lover of nature, invite her on a hike or picnic; if she's an art aficionado, visit a museum together and have her explain the exhibits to you. Find ways to indulge the passions that complement her faith.
Be prepared for her idea of a good time to differ from your own. She may not drink alcohol or find an inappropriate sense of humor funny. Be mindful of the ways that her beliefs guide her relationships and act accordingly.

, If you're also Christian, the two of you already have plenty to talk about. If not, explore other similarities in your interests and personal beliefs that help you relate to one another. You may be alike in many other ways that count.You may, for instance, find yourself agreeing on philosophical issues outside of any religious framework. These are compelling values that will allow the two of you to relate.
Learn what her stance is on a particular topic or issue. Ask her ""what do you believe about...?"" or ""how do you feel about...?"" and then propose a topic that you want to find out more about. Be careful not to offend, however. Religious and moral issues can be challenging to discuss with someone you don't yet know very well.

, Without interrogating her, try to discover her views on dating as it relates to her religion. Some denominations of Christianity take different approaches to activities such as dating that continue to evolve in a modern setting. It can be helpful to know how things like long-term expectations and her personal conditions for dating will proceed from the outset.

, Start off with something casual, like coffee and conversation or a long walk. Take the opportunity to learn more about her and spend some time alone. A casual setting will make it easier to talk about intimate topics, and give you a trial run to see if you're a good fit for each other.Just because she's Christian doesn't mean she's not capable of having fun. Get creative. Think of activities you can do together that challenge and exhilarate you. Most of the things you would do on an ordinary date are just as acceptable here.

, Make her comfortable by letting her know she has nothing to hide or feel self-conscious about. Discussing religious beliefs with new acquaintances can be awkward. Just remember that everyone has their own convictions that play a part in what they're like—these are hers.Reinforce her willingness to be open with you. When disagreements arise, reassure her with statements like: ""even though we don't believe the same things, I support and care about you, and want to know more about what you think."" Knowing that you're receptive to her views will make her much more comfortable sharing them with you.
Talk to her about your own beliefs as well. It's probably just as important for her to know what your moral values are. This is an element of dating that people downplay or postpone all too often, and it should be given special consideration in a relationship with a religious foundation.
Even if you share the same faith, differences in denomination or church liturgy may exist. Get these differences out in the open and do your best to be accepting of them.

, Prove to her that you care enough to at least make an effort to find out more about her lifestyle. Her faith is likely the central priority in her life, the way work or a passion or project might be for someone else. Keep an open mind and see what it's all about.


If you're not the religious type, this step may prove difficult. If it makes you uncomfortable to continue accompanying her to church, let her know and explain your reasons to her.

, Get to know her family, friends and congregation as well as her. Many churches organize events outside of worship where church members and their loved ones can come together as a community. Attend social gatherings with her; this way, you're taking steps to becoming part of one of the most important aspects of her life., While being supportive of her faith is a must, so is having time for yourselves. Find opportunities to cook meals together, go to the movies or just sit and talk. Her spiritual commitments are one thing, but your relationship should still be about the two of you.Plan regular date nights or clear some time to do the things you both like to do. Remember the other interests you discussed that initially attracted you to her and find more ways to make your connection stronger.

, Make sure clear boundaries are in place concerning the ways you talk to and treat one another in regards to your beliefs. Once you've begun dating, you should both be working to ensure that the other feels comfortable and appreciated. This may sometimes be difficult if you don't share her religious beliefs. Knowing what is expected when you're together can make communication easier and prevent either person from feeling unfairly judged.Always be respectful. Religion can be a touchy subject, even between people who are close.
Be aware of what is and isn't an acceptable way (as well as time and setting) to discuss your views. If you know a certain line of conversation might cause offense, you're probably better off avoiding it. Tactful communication is vital when it comes to talking about your closely-held convictions.

, Consult one another on any potential changes in each person's life that might impact the relationship. It should be a cooperative affair every step of the way. If some facet of her beliefs or your own becomes an issue, discuss it coolly and reasonably and strive to reach a compromise you can both live with.It's possible that her religious beliefs might cause complications in dealing with matters like sex, careers, marriage and childbirth. If you've been open with one another about these things from the beginning, it will make talking them out easier. Every couple tackles difficult problems occasionally, and there should be no reason that your beliefs should drive a wedge between you if you care about each other.

, Be the person that she needs you to be. Living in accordance with Christian values is about being kind, gentle, modest and giving. This is what she's looking for in a partner, and it's why she's chosen to spend time with you. As long as you're willing to be open and supportive of one another, your relationship should be a success."

Consider the girl's relationship history (and your own).",How to Choose the Right Girlfriend," This may seem like a no-brainer, but it's something all too many forget! Though almost every relationship will have difficult patches, relationships should bring happiness to both partners (most of the time). Your girlfriend should be someone that you know can bring out positive emotions in you. If the girl you're considering starting a relationship with makes you wish you were somewhere else or causes you to become tense or unhappy often, you'll want to seriously reconsider. Ask yourself the following questions:


Can I be myself around this person, or do I have to put up a ""nice"" front?
Is this someone I naturally enjoy talking to?
Do we seem to enjoy the time we spend together?;
, We all know how the old saying goes: ""You can't love someone else if you don't love yourself."" Heed this advice - pick a girlfriend who loves herself and has a healthy self-image. Such girls are likely to be emotionally stable and have reasonable, realistic priorities that are compatible with a relationship.


How do you know if a girl loves herself? Usually, a person with a healthy amount of self-respect will have some (if not all) of the following qualities:

Proper hygiene habits
Confidence in her own abilities
A relaxed, genuine demeanor
An ability to find humor in herself without being overly self-deprecating



, If you don't feel a real emotional connection to your girlfriend, it doesn't really matter how pretty she is - your relationship is going to be a dull one. You'll want to choose a girlfriend primarily based on an emotional attraction, rather than a physical one. Ask yourself: ""Would I still want to be in a relationship with this girl if she got a rash on her face?"" If so, you probably have an attraction that's more than skin deep!


This being said, there's absolutely nothing wrong with cherishing your S.O.'s beauty, so if you have an emotional connection with someone that you're also physically attracted to, all the better! Physical attraction is certainly one ingredient in a healthy relationship - it's just not the most important ingredient.

, Laughter is part of almost every healthy relationship! Sharing a laugh is one of the greatest ways to form a quick emotional bond with someone, so the more you and your girlfriend can make each other laugh, the better. Try to choose a girlfriend with whom you're able to regularly enjoy open, non-forced laughs and a little good-natured teasing.


One thing to consider is that different types of people will enjoy different types of comedy. If, for instance, you enjoy raunchy humor, but the girl you have your eyes on is somewhat more innocent, you may be in store for some minor awkwardness. This isn't to say that two people with different senses of humor can't learn to appreciate each others' - just that it's something to be aware of.

, Girls, like guys, should have their own interests and priorities besides their partner. Pick a girlfriend who shows that she's set on living a rich, fulfilling life regardless of whether you start a relationship by working towards her own goals. A girl like this offers a rewarding dating experience - after all, it's easy to be interested in people who are interesting.


Better still, someone with her own interests is likely to be able to teach you things you may not otherwise have learned.

, This is one of the most common (yet most preventable) recipes for relationship disasters. Before you begin dating (or right after you start), it's a good idea to talk about what each partner wants from the relationship. Keep in mind that certain relationships which may otherwise work out can be hamstrung by differences in each partners' priorities. Below are just a few of the things you'll want to consider with your prospective girlfriend:


Exclusivity - will you two commit to each other, or is your relationship a casual one with the possibility for flings with other people?
Future goals - does either partner have plans that may interfere with the relationship (e.g., moving for school or work, going on a long sabbatical, etc.)?
Other commitments which may affect your dating - does either partner have beliefs or values that will put boundaries on the relationship (e.g., religious beliefs, household rules, etc.)?

, If you're looking for a dedicated girlfriend, don't waste time with someone who's uninterested in a committed relationship. A relationship with this type of girl can be fun for a while, but may end in heartbreak when she gets interested in someone else. If your prospective girlfriend seems reluctant to agree to an exclusive relationship or flat out refuses the possibility, look elsewhere.


The exception to this rule, of course, is that if neither of you want to commit, you can theoretically have a casual, non-exclusive relationship. Still, approach this possibility with caution - can you truly, honestly stand to see the girl you like with someone else?

, Some girls, like some guys, don't have the healthiest priorities when it comes to the relative importance of people and things. As a rule, good girlfriends won't watch you go broke trying to please them. While presents, tokens, of affection, and fancy nights out have their place, they shouldn't be a constant requirement to date someone. If the girl you're thinking about dating seems more interested in the things she'll get as a result of being a girlfriend than in actually being a girlfriend, pass on the dating opportunity.


Try to ask yourself questions like ""would this person still like me if I couldn't afford to take her out?"" and ""can we enjoy each others' company without spending any money?"" If you're not able to answer ""yes"" to many of these questions, a relationship with this person may have a material foundation, rather than an emotional one.
When it comes to placing material demands on a significant other, the distinction between what's normal and what isn't normal should be obvious. Obviously, special occasions, like birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, etc. are cause for celebration.

, That old relationship adage ""communication is key"" - is repeated often, but for good reason. When it comes to girlfriends, you want someone who's willing to be open and honest with you, especially when it comes to any problems than may be affecting her or your relationship as a whole. While it may seem superficially desirable to have a girlfriend who always acts happy, even when she's not, this is actually the last type of person you'll want to date, as negative emotions, if concealed and left to fester, can build into serious problems for your relationship.

, This is very, very important. Relationships are a two-way street, so it's just as important for you to treat your girlfriend with respect and affection as the reverse is. If the girl you're thinking about dating doesn't seem like she'll be able to make the same investment of time and emotional energy in you as you plan to in her, a relationship is probably not a good idea.


Remember, relationships are just as much about you as they are about your partner. Relationships should be opportunities for you to make your (already great) life even better with someone you care for and respect, not just to make your partner happy.

, You can tell a lot about someone from the people they surround themselves with. Everyone's personality and opinions are determined to some extent by their peers, so scout out the friends of the girl you're interested in to get a sense of what she may be like. Getting to know a potential girlfriend's girlfriends is almost always a good idea - not only can they help you figure out whether a girl is right for you, but, if you befriend them and let them know about your crush, they can also increase your chances of getting a date.


Also consider the fact that, even if you find a girl to be nothing like her friends, these are still people you'll probably end up spending a decent amount of time around.

, As noted above, a good sense of humor is a big plus in any significant other, but one person's idea of what's funny isn't necessarily the same as another's. Mismatched senses of humor can occasionally lead to tremendous awkwardness - for instance, if one person thinks something is funny and the other thinks the same thing is offensive, hurt feelings are a very real possibility. Try to get a sense for whether the girl you have your eyes on has a similar sense of humor as you do - ideally, you should both be able to make each other laugh with ease.


Try to test for a mutual sense of humor by hanging out with this girl (in a no-pressure, non-romantic context) and cracking small jokes. If you get a good response, you can move on to riskier jokes, but avoid racy or controversial humor until you're actually dating.

, The old cliché ""The couple that plays together stays together"" has some truth to it. If you and a potential girlfriend like at least some of the same things, you'll have an easier time finding things to do together, leading to funner dates, happier weekends, and overall less boredom within the relationship. Luckily, it's not hard to find out what someone likes to do, as this is very, very common ""small talk"" topic. Just ask!


This isn't to say that two people with different interests can't be together. In fact, one of the benefits of dating someone is getting to try new things - things your partner likes to do that you might otherwise never have explored.

, Different people, even if they are the same age, will naturally be at different levels of maturity. This is especially true during adolescence, when just a year's time can bring about massive change in a teen's life. If you're looking for a girlfriend, you'll want one who's roughly at the same level of maturity as you. Generally speaking, mature people are more open to ""serious"", long-term relationships, while less-mature people tend to favor casual, lighthearted relationships. Two partners who are otherwise suited to each other might expect very different things from a relationship if they're at different levels of maturity, so consider whether the girl you're thinking about seems mismatched with you in this regard or not.


Ask yourself:

""Does this person seem to be planning for their future more (or less) than me?""
""Does this person have different ideas than me about how ""serious"" an ideal relationship is?""
""Does this person's future plans reflect a different level of maturity than my own?""



, This is a big one. Though it's perfectly possible for a person to change his or her relationship habits over time, it's impossible to predict the future - only to analyze the past. If a person has a history of certain relationship issues, it's a serious possibility (though definitely not a certainty) that these issues may pop up in your relationship. For instance, if a girl you're interested in has a history of quickly ""getting bored"" with her boyfriends and moving on, this is something you should seriously consider before getting together. It's always important to consider potential future relationship problems before choosing a girlfriend (without, of course, adopting a judgmental or cynical attitude towards this girl, who obviously can't control her past).


It's also equally important to take a very frank look at your own dating history. What sorts of girlfriends, if any, have you chosen in the past? Have you had your own recurring issues? Does your potential girlfriend seem like she'll be the kind of person you've historically ""looked for""?

If you’re bending over backwards to impress her, doing flips or walking on your hands, or trying out every joke in your arsenal, she’ll be on to your tricks. Instead, take a deep breath, relax, and get ready to work your magic. Speak slowly enough for her to hear you, don’t look like you’re clinging onto every single syllable she says, and don’t comment on the fact that your joke has fallen flat if it does. Just be yourself and the rest will follow.


Remember that if you really want to charm a lady, then you have to show her that you’re comfortable with being who you are. If you’re grinning from ear to ear while sweating and fidgeting, she won’t be charmed.
Keep your body language calm and relaxed. Keep your hands at your sides or use them to gesture, keep your posture straight, and look at the lady instead of at the floor.;
, Women love men who have a good sense of humor and who are also able to laugh at themselves. If you want to charm the lady, then you have to show that you don’t take yourself too seriously, and that you’re comfortable enough with who you are to poke fun at yourself. If you know you’re wearing a ridiculous pink shirt, that you have a cute gap in the front of your teeth, or that you’re known to be clumsy, don’t try to hide these adorable qualities from the girl; instead, show that you’re comfortable with who you are, flaws and all.


This doesn’t mean that you should be so self-deprecating that you look like you lack confidence. Just a light joke at your own expense or the ability to laugh at yourself if the lady makes the joke will do just fine.
Remember that a lady doesn’t want to hear really crass humor. The joke at your own expense can be completely PG.

, This is another way to charm a lady. You don’t have to be completely serious all the time. Talk about your embarrassing nickname for your puppy; show off your ability to juggle. Pull a quarter out of her ear (okay, so maybe not). Don’t be afraid to be a little bit silly, and the lady will be charmed by your childlike approach to the world. This does not mean that you have to look immature to be a little bit goofy.


If you’re at a place where a silly song like “The Macarena” comes on, don’t be afraid to show off your moves.
If you’re too obsessed with looking cool, she won’t want to open up to you. You don’t have to put it all out there, but if you put up too many walls, she won’t feel like she’s getting to know you.

, A true lady pays attention to her looks, so you should do the same. You don’t have to look like George Clooney, but you should make sure your clothes are appropriate for the occasion, free of wrinkles, smelling fresh, and generally flattering. If you think stubble makes you look more mysterious, then fine, but in general, make sure that your face and hair are well groomed and that you shower before you head out for a night of meeting ladies.


You don’t have to obsess over your looks to win a woman over with the care you put into your appearance.
You can wear a little bit of cologne, but not so much that you overwhelm the woman.

, Don’t underestimate the effect that a big, charming smile can have on a woman. While you don’t have to be grinning from ear to ear, you should smile at the woman when you first meet, and whenever it’s appropriate to smile when you’re talking. As long as it doesn’t make you look nervous, she’ll appreciate that you’re comfortable enough to smile when it feels good, and not feeling too cool to show her a little positive energy.


Don’t just smile at the lady. If she sees you smiling at others, she’ll see what a welcoming, positive guy you are.

, If you want to charm a lady, then you can’t just put all of your attention on her and ignore the people around you. She should see that you are the kind of guy that can charm almost anyone in his orbit, and that is truly impressive. You should charm elderly people, young, bored children, or even the shyest person at the party. Find something that any person can talk about and make that person feel special, carefree, and comfortable opening up to you.


Though you shouldn’t ignore the lady to do this, if she can see you working your magic on anyone in the room, she’ll be even more charmed by you.
Make sure that you’re not seen charming too many other ladies, though. The lady should still feel special at all times even if you’re engaging with other people.
Another way to charm the people around you is to introduce them to each other in a seamless way. Say something like, “Mary, have you met Joe? He just got a new pit bull and you must have some advice for how to make it behave…”

, Do you know a bit of French? Un poco Español? If you know a little bit of a foreign language, show it off without being too annoying. Don’t start throwing every foreign language you know at the woman, but if she finds out that you spend some time in France, or that your father is from Madrid, then bust out a sentence or two and watch her swoon. Sure, this is a cheap trick, but if you use it at the right time, the lady will be completely charmed by you.


Only try this one if you really feel confident about your skills. Don’t blunder through a phrase or two if you really don’t know much more Spanish than how to pronounce tequila.


, You do not need to be Hugh Grant or even Brad Pitt to be sexy. Sexy is confidence and an aura you send. It comes with self-love (not narcissism, however). Being sexy is simply being out of reach and comfortable in your body. A nice smile is always good, as is having a nice scent. Humans respond to the 5 senses - important senses for you will be scent and touch.


If you want to look unattainable, then don't be too needy. The lady should see that you like her company, but that you won't be heartbroken without her.

, If you really want to charm the lady, then you have to make her feel special. Take the spotlight off yourself and focus it on her, showing that you care about who she is and what she has to say. You don’t have to make her feel like she’s the subject of a detective show. Just ask her some softball questions about where she grew up, what her friends or siblings are like, or what she likes to do for fun.


If she tells you she has a pet, ask to see some pictures.
Avoid asking anything too personal, like questions about her past relationships.
Just get her talking. If you sense that she’s been talking about herself too much and feels uncomfortable, find a way to relate to what she’s saying.

, The key is sincerity. Don’t say something vapid like, “I like your hair,” unless she has truly unique hair that has incredible curls or a color you’ve never seen before. Instead, dig deeper and tell her something she’s never heard before, or something that truly makes her feel like you’re paying attention to her, not just trying to flatter her so she likes you even more.


If she has incredible eyes or a wonderful laugh, tell her that.
Dig deeper. Compliment aspects of her personality, such as her sense of humor or her observational skills, if you can.
If she’s wearing an amazing necklace or pair of earrings, compliment them and maybe you’ll get the story of where she got them.

, Show the lady that you care about what she thinks, not just about who she is. She’ll see that you respect her as an intelligent being with valid opinions. Ask her what she thinks about your outfit, your favorite band, or your favorite TV show. You don’t have to ask about the touchy subjects such as politics or religion until you know each other better. Keep it light but show her you care.


You can even start small and ask her what she thinks about the wine you’re drinking if you’re at a party. If a song comes on, ask what she thinks about the band.
When she gives you an answer, don’t just move on, but take the time to seriously consider what she thinks.

, One thing that turns ladies off instantly is when a man talks to her and nods vigorously, but shows that he’s not really listening at all. If you want to show her that you’re listening, you have to do more than nod and say “Yeah,” at the right times. You have to follow up to what she says by asking more questions, or even refer back to something she said earlier in the conversation for brownie points.


For example, if she says she loves the 49ers, you can say, “Is that because you grew up in California? If I had lived there when I was a kid, I would probably be a die hard fan too…”

, There’s a difference between charming other people and flirting with every girl in your line of sight. If you want to charm the lady, then you have to make her see that she’s the only girl you truly have eyes for. You can be charming to other girls, but make it clear that she’s the one you’re really paying attention to. If you’re equally flirtatious and charming around every girl you see, then she’ll start to feel like you don’t think she’s special at all.


Make sure you always keep your eye on her, even if you’re talking to someone else.

, Obviously you can’t give the girl a gift right then and there—unless you’re skilled in origami and can make her a beautiful flower out of a napkin. But if you’re going to see her again, you can charm her with a small gift, such as her favorite candy bar, a small bouquet of hand-picked flowers, or even a copy of a book or CD you were telling her about. There’s no need to go overboard, or she’ll feel like you’re coming on too strong, but giving the right small and thoughtful gift will charm her even more.


Giving her something with a personal touch will make her feel even more special, and truly charmed by you.

, Ladies love men who know how to dance. If you’ve taken a class in ballroom dancing, foxtrot, salsa, or really any kind of dance at all, it’s time to show off your moves and to get out on the dance floor—if there is one in your vicinity, that is. But even if you’re not a dance master, going out on the dance floor and dancing like a complete goofball is better than acting like you’re too cool or too afraid to dance.


If you’re really afraid, take some dance lessons. This will not only improve your charm level, but it’s a great way to meet even more ladies.

, This is a great way to charm a lady. You shouldn’t use her name every five seconds or you’ll start to sound like a used car salesman, but you should try to use it a few times throughout the course of the conversation so that she feels like you really care about her. Try this trick to charm the lady or to charm almost any person in your orbit, really.


Just a simple, “You see, Amy…” will help make the girl feel special.

, A lady will be charmed if you know where to touch her to make her feel special without coming on too strong. If you’re really hitting it off, touch her lightly on the elbow, the shoulder, or the knee (if she’s sitting down.) Only do this once she’s shown some affection towards you or when you know she’s comfortable with you. She’ll be charmed by your delicate and smooth gesture.


Even lightly tapping her hand if she’s telling you a sensitive story will do the trick.
Obviously, don’t touch her anywhere inappropriate.

Brazilian girls are not open to everyone.",How to Date a Brazilian Girl," They love guys with a great smile and a nice posture. Show that you like to be around them and make it obvious that you're interested.;
, They like to be touched, like everyone else, but only when they allow it! If you touch someone uninvited, it can really be an abuse. It doesn't matter if she is shy or not, respect her space.

, It might seem random, but Brazilian girls are automatically attracted to guys that smell nice, even if you're not a Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio. They like refreshing scents, and this is true for every Brazilian girl - smell like if you have just came out of a great bath, and it will open many doors for you.

, Most of them like guys that know what they want. But some others prefer to take the initiative. So, if you are too shy too ask them out, look for Brazilian girls who take the initiative, and give them some tips so that they can know you are interested.

, If you want to make a good impression on a good looking girl, ALWAYS wear nice clothes. A tight shirt and well fitting jeans will open doors for you.

, If you're not Brazilian, they will find you sexy because you're different. This is a good thing! Compliment her in your language, and she will automatically want to know what it means.

There is a German saying: ""Wer nicht kämpft hat schon verloren"" which basically means ""Who doesn't fight has already lost."",
Keep an eye on her body language for that is very important.,
Attempt to have some private time with her, such as taking a walk with her and other innocent, sweet activities similar to that.,
Talk to her and find out what you two have in common.,

Once you're positive that the girl is interested in you, ask her out on a date, but remember not to appear desperate or frightened.,
Ask her to go to the city or the cinema with you.,
When on a date with the girl, remember the first rule: Never look at her below the neck.",How to Conquer a Girl's Love," Therefore, take courage and don't approach the girl you love with a desire to ask her out, then quickly back out at the last minute and run away. Although you might be afraid that she'll decline your invitation, you'll never know if she is really interested in you or not if you don't take the courage to ask her.;
, If you update yourself every day on her interest in you, you'll be able to tell if she likes you or not. Gestures such as touching you for little things (ex: you told her a funny joke), keeping a steady eye contact, and showing up where you are a lot. However, how bold and obvious her actions are will depend on the amount of confidence she has in herself.


If she has high confidence, it'll be easier to read her body language.






If she has low confidence, it may be a little more difficult to read her body language.







, Small gestures of affection - such as sitting next to her in class - will not only possibly make her heart flutter, but it will also single her out from all the other girls and let her know that she is the one on your mind.


Don't forget to give her space that she needs. Avoid sitting next to her all the time or else her friends will begin to grow annoyed and possibly annoyed.







, This will build some bridges on the long way of dating. Also, it's helpful to know what her favorite band is when you're trying to purchase her a poster for her birthday.

, They don't have to be big gifts, but sweet and small things will mean a lot to her. It will also let her know that she is on your mind and that you care for her.

, Otherwise, she may choose to decline your invitation, thinking that you aren't the right kind for her or are intimidated by her. Keep your tone friendly and polite. Make sure your sentence is sweet, short, and clear.

, Be a bit romantic while trying not to get carried away and also keep an eye on her body language without being noticeable. If she is turning away from you, know to stop the romance at an appropriate time. Note what turns her on and what doesn't.

, If you're already doing that, you're definitely out of the game, and you also might be scaring her, unless if she is the confident type that doesn't mind guys checking her out. When you eye her below the neck, you're labeling yourself as someone untrustworthy who is perhaps only interested in the girl's body rather than her personality. Also, if word gets out, your reputation could be lowered and your relationship with that girl teeters on the edge of shattering to pieces. Give her the respect she deserves, and she'll most likely notice and appreciate you for that.

For men, makes sure your pants are where they're supposed to be, on or above your waste, sagging only makes you look like a slob and that's a turn off to most women.

,, Having good manners can get you far with the opposite sex. Please do not use profanity or unnecessary words like gay or retarded, you might offend the person you're talking to.

, Make sure you aren't slumping when you walk. Always keep a straight back and a warm smile on your face when you're walking towards them.

, This is a huge part to having a successful conversation with the opposite sex. Start with a nice greeting:Hi, Hello, etc. Introduce yourself in a nice manner and if you think that person may be up to it, offer a handshake. Ask them how they're doing and really listen when they tell you. A great way to start a nice conversation is to ask them what kind of music they like, then moving on to movies, books, TV shows or even magazines, depending on the subject. Make sure you make eye-contact when speaking, it's a sign that you're listening and that you're interested in what they're saying. Another very important thing is knowing when to stop talking. Always give the other person a chance to reply.

, Knowing how to end a conversation is just as important as knowing how to start one. Thank them for their time or for them talking to you and that you enjoyed it.

Also, try to wear your hair a little long, but not pass the jawline or you will come off as not taking care of yourself, never shave your head. You'll just look like a baseball.

, A good smelling guy always gets the girl's attention, even if they don't see your face.

, Never say anything rude or bad or swear and never talk about sex or anything related to it. Remember, no matter how ugly you are, she'll always admire you as long as you're polite. Just behave like a true gentleman for once!

, Say she's wearing a t-shirt with your favorite band on it, that would be a good conversation starter! Note: NEVER try to like something that she likes just to have something in common. If she likes something, you can check it out, but don't pretend to like it. You could get hooked into going to a Britney Spears concert or something.

, Talk to her about simple things. Some examples can be what music she likes, what she likes to do with her time, what she does over the summer. Don't ask these one after another, spend time on each topic, maintaining an interest in what she is saying. Remember, this is a lengthy process, so don't screw it up early by wanting to rush. Once you've kept up with this for a while, you can start getting a little more personal about the things you speak about.

, Girls like guys that can be honest and talk about things in their lives.


They also need a person to listen to them and the things they say.






If she wants to talk for hours, tell your friends you're busy tonight. Making yourself available to talk is a great way to show her you're there for her. All though you're not dating, she'll be comforted knowing she has a person she can talk to. Obviously, it will take some time before she confides completely in you. Girls are naturally skeptical about trusting guys with the truth about themselves at first.







, If you are comfortable with the girl, and you feel that you can trust her, help her to be able to trust you. Before you do this next step, make sure that she has confided in you a few things about herself. Once this is done, set a date. Don't be too forward. If she has done what was previously been stated, you will not be rejected.

, Girls, as much as you don't believe it, like the guy who listens to them more than the tough guy. Yes, they want to feel protected physically, but nothing beats being emotionally protected. This is very important.

, Don't be nervous. You've talked with this girl for a while now, and you've let her know the kind of person you are.


She was willing to go out with that person, so don't be nervous. You're in a good spot.






Remember, though, the first date does not mean you're committed to each other only. If you play everything right, when you say goodnight, you make the determination of the kiss goodnight.






If you feel that you've bonded go for it.






Don't be hasty. Lean in slowly and close your eyes. Go almost completely all the way to her lips, and wait for her to meet you there. Don't go all the way, this might scare her off. Give her some room and time to make the decision. Go about 85-90% of the way.






Once you get this kiss, you've basically sealed a second date. Tell her that you had a wonderful night, and say that exactly. Don't deviate, don't worry about sounding corny, she'll love it.







, You're now in the honeymoon period, where you have some time to get used to each other. This is the time that you do the cute things of the relationship. Come up with a song together that you can label as ""Our song."" Some great ones can be ""I could not ask for more"" by Edwin McCain, ""Something Coming Over"", by O.A.R., ""Breathing"", by Lifehouse, ""Amazed"", by Lonestar. These are only examples, you can choose yourself, this is just a guide for what you should look for. Also, if you have a band you both mutually are really into, try to choose a song by that band. Make sure to read the lyrics and understand the song before you pick though. Some songs can be deceiving with their meanings.

, One thing that happens a lot after the honeymoon period, is that you'll notice little things your significant other does that bother you. Don't call her out on them, it will cause a fight and you don't want that.

, Although you may get tired of saying it, she'll never tire of hearing it. Girls love being complimented on everything about them. Let them hear it every single day.

, This is probably the most important step of them all. Don't mention sex for a while. Your friends might tease you about it, and ride you for a while about it. But they'll never have as amazing of a relationship as you, because you are the gentleman.


After a few months, maybe casually bring it up. Always have a talk about it before trying ANYTHING. She'll want to talk about it. Especially if she's seen how you care for her, and would never use her for anything.






Talk about how you do not want to rush her and you do not want to make her feel uncomfortable in any way. Tell her that you will wait until she is ready, even if it means waiting years. She'll appreciate these words.






Don't constantly bring it up. Let her tell you when she is ready. Make sure she gets birth control and you wear a condom before having sex. You don't want her first experience to be ruined by worries and tears.






She'll tell you that she is ready, and even then, ask her once or twice if she's sure, because you realize it's a big step in the relationship.






Be romantic about it. She won't like it if her first time is in a car or in a bathroom at the movies. Her house would be the best. She'll feel comfortable with her surroundings. Light a few candles to set the mood.







, Be nice, be a gentleman, and you won't regret it.

Give her space.",How to Capture Her Heart," Figure out what she likes to eat (this is the part where you find out if she’s a vegetarian or not). After you figure out what she likes to eat, practice cooking the meal a few times. Once you're comfortable, invite her over and serve her dinner (as long as the food is edible she'll be impressed). The thought of you taking the time and effort to actually cook a dinner for her will show her that you care enough about her to devote your time to make her feel special.;
, You should never hit a woman, but a friendly disagreement is a good way to get a girl's attention and keep it. The next time you talk to her, find something to disagree with her about and don't give in. By standing your ground, you will show her confidence and a willingness to defend yourself. Be careful not to be too stubborn. The livelier the discussion, the more time she will spend thinking about it afterwards which equates to time thinking about you.

, When you first start spending time with a girl, pick two or three small details to remember about her appearance and commit them to memory. Make sure that the time you choose to try this method is a time that will be brought up often in future conversations (a first date is a great time to use this). Now simply wait for her to bring the event up. When she does, casually say something like ""yeah, I remember that, you were wearing that black dress and those heart earrings."" This simple statement shows that she is important to you and that you pay attention to her.

, Communication is very important to women. If you want to really understand a woman and capture her heart then listen to what she says carefully. Maintain eye contact and take part into the conversation. Share your opinion and your ideas freely. A real conversation does not mean that you have to agree with everything she says. An active communication shows that you are confident and serious.

, Women love surprises. Surprises do not have to cost a lot of money. They can be simple but original. After all, it is the thought that counts the most. Also, put some imagination in your surprise. For example, plan a trip to a place she loves and that is important to both of you.

, There will always be difficult situations in a woman's life. Support her through problems that she might confront. Show her that you are there to help her. Let her feel protected and confident around you. Also, be supportive when she tries to achieve her goals and dreams, and be happy for her achievements.

, If you want to capture a woman's heart, obviously you need to keep the lines of communication open. Call and text her throughout the day, just to let her know you're thinking of her. When you know she has to be at work at 9:30AM, text her about 10 and say something like ""good morning, beautiful"". Ask her how she slept, or what she dreamt about. Women love to feel like you're thinking about them, so don't hesitate to make it obvious.

, A compliment is valued when there is a surprise element to it. Telling her how witty you find her, how her intelligence turns you on, appreciating how thoughtful and generous she can be, or her gentle nature, all these are deeper compliments, which when paid sincerely make the recipient feel ten feet tall.

, Don’t be possessive and make her account to you regarding her whereabouts. Let her know you trust her. Don’t expect her to spend all her free time with you. Let her have her own life too. Often when in a relationship people make the mistake of spending every waking moment that they can manage together, and in the process alienate themselves from friends and even lose their identity. Let her be her own person.

Choose a method of study.,
Find a good wingman.,
Practice talking to women often.,
Get yourself out there.",How to Become a Pick Up Artist1," There are many different styles of pick up artistry and different teachers or “gurus” teach or advocate for different methods. Research the different styles of seduction and focus on the one that feels most organic to who you are as a person.Some of the different gurus include David DeAngelo, Mystery, Ross Jeffries and JT Tran.
David DeAngelo believes seduction is a numbers game and that you'll only improve by meeting and talking to lots of different women.
Mystery is the most famous pick up artist working and has ""trained"" many of the other pick up artists working today. He advocates dressing ostentatiously and engaging women in conversation immediately upon entering the room.
Ross Jeffries prefers to talk to women during the day, specifically in quiet places like coffee shops.
JT Tran believes in teaching men self-confidence and communication skills in order to improve their experiences with women.
There are many forums on the Internet devoted to analyzing different methods of study. Do research before pursuing a specific method.
Some gurus also offer boot camps for aspiring pick up artists. These camps are expensive, usually costing upwards of $3,000 and don't offer much beyond what you can for free online.;
, A wingman is a huge asset for a pickup artist; they’re there to set you up, to make you look good and to help you get comfortable as you’re meeting and talking to new women. Choose a friend you can trust and who likes to have a good time, but not such a good time that they can’t focus on the task at hand.Try to find a wingman with a serious girlfriend. That way, you won’t be competing for the same women.
Don’t choose a wingman who is more attractive, fashionable or charming than you. Find someone who is your equal.

, Learning to talk to women is a skill like anything else, and the only way to get better is through study and repetition. Set time aside each week to go out and pick up women. Bring your wingman with you, or attempt to do it alone, but either way, get out there and practice.Set clear, accomplishable goals. Decide to talk to five women a week, or aspire to get one phone number every day.
The more time you devote to your training, the more your anxiety will dissipate when talking to women.

, It’s impossible to pick up women from the comfort of your own home, so a key step in becoming a pick up artist is leaving your house. Try to go out and meet new people several times a week; the more places you go, the more opportunities you’ll have to meet women.Try going to bars and clubs on weekends; they’re usually crowded, so you’ll have lots of opportunities to meet and speak with different women.
Take out your headphones while you’re walking. You can’t have a conversation with someone if you’re not even aware they’re right next to you."

Show your smarts.,
Demonstrate your passion.,
Joke around.,
Be sweet.,
Listen to what she says.,
Take care of yourself.,
Get confident.,
Show assertiveness.,
Branch out.,
Learn about the things she likes.,
Accept her for who she is.",How to Be the Type of Nerd That Girls Love," Intelligence is a highly attractive trait. Don’t be afraid to show a girl that you are smart. They want to be able to have an intelligent conversation with a guy, rather than only discussing sports or pop culture. You just might be able to teach her something or show her a new perspective.For example, if a girl you like is struggling with chemistry, offer to help her. Explain what she is having trouble with and try a lab experiment together. She’ll appreciate your knowledge and your effort.;
, Girls like guys who are passionate about something, and it doesn’t really matter if your passion is comic books, calculus, or coin collecting. Showing a girl that you care about something and have learned a lot about the subject is one way to win her heart.Explain to her why you love Dungeons and Dragons. Offer to let her play with you and show her how much fun it can be.

, Girls just wanna have fun! They will enjoy spending time with a guy with whom they can joke around, laugh with, and be silly. Girls appreciate a guy who doesn’t take himself, or the world, seriously all the time., Girls love nice guys. They want to be treated well, and will appreciate a guy that is respectful to them, their friends, and their parents. Be sweet by complimenting her or writing her a nice note.Helping others in need is a great way to show a girl your sweet side, so offer to help a classmate understand a tricky concept in class or stand up to a bully that is picking on someone else.

, Pay attention when a girl is talking to you, and respond to her questions or anxieties. Remembering what she said later will show her that you think what she has to say is worthwhile and that you care.

, Although you should stay true to your personal style, it is important to take care of yourself. Pay attention to personal hygiene, such as showering daily, wearing deodorant, and brushing your teeth. Always wear clean clothes, and consider styling your hair. You could even spritz on a little cologne so that you smell great when a girl compliments your Star Trek t-shirt., Confidence is an attractive trait, but cockiness really isn’t. People who are confident know their talents, but also recognize that there is room to improve, while those who are cocky believe they are the best. One of the best ways to show your confidence is to be the leader and help others if they're having a hard time. Allow girls to see you in the role of leader or expert.


Saying “I know I’m going to ace this test. I’m smarter than the teacher!” is an example of cockiness. Instead, confidently say “I’m prepared for this test so I think I’ll do well.”

, While it’s important to be nice, you don’t want to get walked all over. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and say what and how you feel. Girls will respect a guy that speaks up rather than just agreeing to whatever she wants.


For example, if someone makes fun of the map of the Shire you keep in your locker, speak up. Explain how interesting and well thought-out the fantasy kingdom is, and tell them how important the books have been to you while growing up.
Don’t allow yourself to be manipulated. If a person only talks to you when they want or need something, chances are you will do just fine without them in your life.

, Talking to people outside your normal group of friends will help you meet girls. Try talking to other people or helping other students with schoolwork. You could even become a tutor! You don't have to stop talking to your regular friends or change your personality - just step out of your comfort zone. This will ensure that you are more noticeable.



Try different activities and interests. You may just surprise yourself by enjoying the activity, and you will also meet new people.
For example, instead of only attending Comic-Con, check out other events and expos as well. Attend a rodeo, go to a pop concert, see an action film, or tailgate before a sports game.

, This is a great way to impress a girl, and you may be surprised by what you learn. For example, if she likes fashion, read up on a couple of her favorite designers. She will be impressed by how open-minded you are, and you will have learned the effect clothing has on socio-economic history.


Though you may well-versed in all things George Lucas, she may love Shakespeare. Read her favorite play or poem, then invite her over to watch Star Wars together.

, You want a girl that likes you for who you are, so you must be willing to like a girl for who she is as well. It’s okay if you don’t have everything in common - opposites attract! Just be respectful of her interests and quirks."

Use an original pick up line.,
Listen and be engaged in the conversation.,
Make statements instead of asking questions.,
Plant your feet in one spot and stand up straight.,
Avoid dinner on a first date.",How to Become a Pick Up Artist2," Women like to feel special, and nothing makes a woman feel less special than hearing the same line over and over again. A pick up line is designed to break the ice, start a conversation and put a woman at ease.If you’re stuck for what to say, make a joke or comment on what’s happening around you.
Try leading with, ""You're so beautiful, you made me forget my pick up line.""
The best ""line"" is always what feels natural to you as a person. Pretending to be something you're not is never the way to go.
Don’t ""neg"" a woman. ""Negging"" is a backhanded compliment designed to undermine a woman's confidence. In reality, negging a woman will only put her on the defensive.

, Starting the conversation is only the first step. Once you convince a woman to talk to you, you actually need to listen to what she has to say. Ask her questions about her life and her job and what she does for fun.Don’t spend the conversation thinking about what to say next. Listen to what she’s saying and you’ll find it much easier to craft your responses.
Don’t spend the whole conversation talking about yourself. Your goal is not to impress her, it’s to get to know her.

, Asking too many questions during a conversation may cause a woman to feel like she is in the midst of a job interview. You can avoid this by making a few assumptions. For instance, instead of asking a woman where she's from, try guessing.Try saying, ""You're from around here, right?""
If you're wrong, the woman will correct you and the conversation will continue. If you're right, she'll be impressed by your insight, and that will help propel the conversation.

, Humans are very sensitive to body language, so make sure your body is conveying confidence. Planting your feet conveys assertiveness and helps women to feel more at ease around you. Be especially cognizant of this when you’re approaching women on the street – you don’t want them to worry that you’re going to attack or follow them.Make sure to look women in the eye when you’re having a conversation with them.
Don’t fidget – it makes you look nervous.

, When you reach the point in the conversation where you would normally ask the woman out, avoid asking her to dinner. Dinner is a wonderful date option, but a table creates a physical barrier, so offer out another alternative for your first date.Instead of dinner, ask her out to coffee or for a walk.
During the date, be physically affectionate. Off your date your hand to help her from her car or take her coat and let your hands gently brush her shoulders.
This will help you gauge whether or not there’s chemistry between you.
Make sure there is chemistry between you before going in for a kiss.
If a woman seems disinterested in the physical contact or asks you to stop, do so immediately.

Eat right and exercise.,
Pay attention to your appearance.,
Develop your sense of humor.,
Get your own place.",How to Become a Pick Up Artist3," In order for you to feel confident talking to women, you first need to feel confident about the way you’re presenting yourself. If you feel self-conscious about your body, change your diet and make an effort to go to the gym.You don’t need to have a six-pack to effectively pick up women. Just focus on getting your body to a place where you feel healthy and comfortable.
If you find an exercise regimen that you’re passionate about, you can use that to try to connect with a woman. Ask her what kinds of exercise she likes to do, then strike up a conversation from there.

, You don’t need to completely overhaul your closet, but adding some new options to your wardrobe will increase your confidence and make you look more stylish and pulled together. And don’t underestimate the importance of personal hygiene or grooming.Take a shower and shave before going out on the town.
The devil is in the details – moisturize your skin, clip your nails, put on some cologne (but don’t overdo it).

, Women love funny guys – laughter puts people at ease and is a great way to make a woman feel comfortable around you. If you’re not naturally funny, consider taking an improv or stand up class. This will help you tap into your natural sense of humor and will help you feel more confident making jokes.Have a few go-to jokes or lines that you can use to break the ice or plug into conversations as needed.
Think about what makes you laugh. The more you understand what tickles you, the easier it will be to write jokes or lines that will make other people laugh.

, Women want to meet men, not little boys. If you’re still living with your parents, moving out will be a huge step for you. Getting your own place will make it easier for you to have women over, plus the independence you’ll feel will translate over into increased self-confidence.If you don’t already have a job, get one. Women want to meet and talk to guys who are self-sufficient.
Look for a place in a centralized area, so it will be easy for you to socialize and meet new people.

Have fair intentions.",How to Be in Harmony With Women," Discover what you want from life, and what makes you tick. There is no point in trying to discover how to get on with woman if you are passionate about cars and machinery. Do what makes you feel genuinely happy. Since you read this article, you are probably interested in finding harmony with woman. Here are main guidelines;
, After all, they deserve it. If you manage to learn about the reasoning, dreams, hopes and emotional reactions of females, you will discover a whole new world of joy and happiness. Women are able to offer a lot more than the majority of men are aware of. Discover it and make this world a better and happier place.

, The eyes are a direct window to a person's soul, and so, looking into her eyes is a good way to find out about her character, her dreams, her fears and her attitude toward life. Learn to 'converse' silently with a single glance. Women are naturally good in 'silent eye talk', and they are happy to find someone who is on the same wavelength. This is an excellent start, usually more honest and better than all ""those"" conversation starters that include cheesy pickup lines and such. Women are deep and emotional, and so, many women would rather a different approach.

, If you really love women and show it, nothing bad can come of it. Even if you are not her type, she will treat you with respect and appreciation for treating her the way she deserves to be treated. This is a win-win situation

, It doesn't mean you need to be a 'wussy'. Show her that you have character enough to be truthful. (Hint: you need not overuse this, she may see it as a weakness. Be honest but don't tell her everything that is on your mind. Best approach is to think in terms of trying to seduce her, filter your honesty a bit to help you toward this goal and to let her know how valuable and rare you are. There is nothing bad in this behavior. For some extra help, watch the Don Juan genre of movies and try to understand the way they talk and how they behave; they had a genuine and honest passion for women.)

, Try to not involve your person in those conversations, rather position yourself on the sideline. (e.g., Right: 'Your eyes are so deep, they could make someone a very happy person'. Wrong: 'I really like your eyes and I am in love with them'.).

, Women are emotional creatures and they cannot resist emotional impulses. Talk to her in an emotionally attached way, gently touch her eyebrows, her hand. If you are genuine, you will feel the urge to do so, and not because you know you need to do it. However, understand that if the woman isn't interested in you in that way, this can and probably will make her uncomfortable. Don't be too touchy, but just touchy enough.

, Dress well, stay in good shape, etc. Love women, but be a man. They will love it.

, If your only intention is to seduce and leave, you are not fall under the category of ""genuine"", but ""womanizer"". Women are feeling, emotional people, not toys, so treat them like people and they will learn respect for you. If your intentions are not genuine it will degrade your status, even in your own eyes.


If you manage to act and behave as described above, chances are, the majority of women will like you very much. At the same time, you will be able to make them and yourself genuinely happy. But like men, there are some women with lower emotional/intellectual potential, who may not give off the reaction you want. You cannot be everything to everyone, and you don't need to be.

This is a subtle way to exchange numbers with the guy you like, and also have a reason for him to call or text you.You could even offer to study with him one on one for an upcoming exam, or ask if he ever wants to do homework together. Then, ask to exchange numbers so you can plan a time to meet up to study.;
, If you are friends with the guy you like on social media, post that you have a new phone and need everyone’s numbers. If you’re close enough with him, he might send you his number, and you can send him a text so he has yours.#* If you aren’t friends with him on social media, add him! This is another easy way to get him to communicate with you that often takes off a little bit of the pressure., Pretend you need to use his phone, then once he gives it to you, program your number into it. You could also ask to see his phone so you can show him something online, or tell him you’ve misplaced your phone and need him to call it. Then, you will have his number stored in your call log, and you can text him with yours!


Never take his phone without asking. This is risky, and also could be seen as pushy, or invasive. Casually ask to borrow his phone, instead.

, If he isn’t picking up on your hints about wanting him to call you, you can find a reason to call him instead. Maybe you missed class one day last week and need notes or the homework assignment, or maybe he lives in your apartment complex and you need someone to pick up your mail the day you’ll be out of town. Find a casual reason to ask for his number, and call him yourself.If you don’t know him very well, or at all, this option might be more difficult.

, If you met him at a coffee shop, strike up a conversation about the best coffee places in the area, and ask for his suggestions. Ask him if he would like to give you a call later on and plan a time to hit up a different shop. If you know him from school, ask him if he knows anyone who might be able to tutor you in something, and ask to exchange numbers in case he knows of someone.


Think of a reason you might need to exchange numbers that doesn’t involve explicitly asking him on a date. That way, the ball will be in his court, so to speak.

, Once he has your number and knows you want him to call, give him a reason to make the call. Let him know you’re free, and then he might get the hint that you want him to call and make plans with you.


Alternatively, you could mention you do have plans, like an outing or event you’re attending, and ask him to give you a call if he would like to come along.

, Once he has your number, if he doesn’t call right away, you can always find subtle ways to remind him he has it. For example, you might be talking about a big test coming up, and say, “You can always give me a call if you need help studying.”


If you’re talking about potentially hanging out or spending time together, you could also say, “You have my number, right?”

, More often than not, guys aren’t going to be very savvy to subtlety, so you may have to give him some hints. You don’t have to demand it, or be too forward. Just let him know you want him to give you a call. You can even ask him to call you about something specific, so it seems less romantic.


Try something like, “Give me a call if you ever want to check out that new movie” or “Call me if you need help with the homework.”
Say something like, “I’d really like it if you gave me a call sometime.” This way, you’re letting him know you’re interested and want him to call, but not demanding it or giving him any kind of deadline to do so.

, If you already have a mutual friend or two, use that friend as a way to talk to him, or as a conversation starter. Or, you could ask your mutual friend to introduce you if you don’t know the guy you like very well yet. Hang out as a group and get on his radar so he’s more likely to call.


Make sure you don’t say anything negative about your mutual friends to the guy you like. You don’t want to come off as a person who talks behind other people’s backs, or as a negative person in general.

, If the guy you like is part of a club or organization at school, join up! Not only will you see each other at meetings, you will also have something new in common, and a new reason to need to talk to each other, which will give him a reason to call.


Use the club as a conversation starter, then you can veer off into other topics. Show him you’re actually interested in the club you joined, and not just because of him.

, Even if he’s a football player and you hate football, hit up practice one afternoon, or go to a game. If you know he does his laundry or drops his dry cleaning at a certain location, make that your new laundry spot, too. If he always eats lunch at a certain place, you should eat there, too. The more you pop up in his day to day life, the more you’ll be on his mind, and the more likely he will be to call.Try not to be too overbearing with this. You don’t want to make him feel like you’re stalking him, or following him around.

, If you sit around waiting for him to call, you might drive yourself crazy. Go about your everyday life, and try to forget about it. That way, when he does call, it won’t feel like you were waiting for too long.Don’t overthink it if he doesn’t call you right away, or even if he doesn’t call at all. More than likely, he got busy and forgot, or maybe he’s just as nervous as you are and isn’t sure when to make that move.

, Give him a chance to call you. Guys like a challenge, so don’t throw yourself at him by calling him too soon after asking him to call you. Make sure he feels like you’re still out of his reach, so he has something to go after.Since you were the one to ask for the call, let him be the one to make the next move. Let him feel like the ball is in his court, so to speak.

, Keeping it under 10 minutes is a good idea. Most guys don’t like to spend a lot of time on the phone, so if you keep talking too long, he might get bored and not want to call you again.Try to have a purpose for the call. For example, have a few things you want to talk about already in your mind before he calls. That way, you won’t end up with any awkward dead air, and neither of you will get bored.

Body spray or cologne can make you more attractive to girls.
Yellow armpit stains may be caused by antiperspirant deodorant. Depending on how much you sweat, you might be better off using a different, non-antiperspirant brand, and wearing a thin undershirt instead to catch some moisture.;
, If any of your clothes are stained or tattered, throw them away and replace them. You don't need to buy into expensive designer fads or mimic what the ""cool kids"" wear, just to show that you think about your style.


Wear clothes that fit you comfortably, not too tight and not too baggy.
Don't wear the same outfit so long that it gets smelly or that people start to comment on it. Ideally, toss your shirt in the laundry basket after one use, and your pants (trousers) after three.

Ironing your clothes doesn't hurt, especially when you're going to an event.

, This isn't necessary to get noticed, but if you want a reputation as a ""cool guy,"" it might pay off to stand out from the crowd. This could be a shirt with a funny joke on it, a brightly colored pin, or a pair of sunglasses.Choose something that you're comfortable wearing regularly, so people start to associate you with a unique style.


Run your choice by close friends first if you're not sure. There's a fine line between standing out in a crowd and looking silly. You can even cross that line and turn the attention to your benefit, but that takes a lot of self-confidence to pull off.

, Confident body language can make a surprising difference in how approachable you look, and can boost your own self-esteem as well.Stand and sit straight up. Your shoulders should be pulled back and aligned over your hips, with the back of your neck straight up over them.


When standing without something to do, find a position that you can hold comfortably, so you don't fidget awkwardly. If you can't stop shifting your weight back and forth, lean slightly against a wall.
If you have trouble keeping your hands still, hold a drink or other object at your side. Don't put the object in front of you, and don't use something distracting like a cell phone – both of these mistakes cut you off from your surroundings.

, Keep your chin up and your head back while walking or standing, and look at the people around you. You'll see a lot more opportunities this way than if you're daydreaming or rushing down the street. This simple change in body language will make you seem more confident and accessible as well, two important traits for attracting social attention.

, If you get tongue-tied or shaky when talking to women, spend some time alone building up to it. Sit in a private place and close your eyes, imagining feeling completely comfortable and calm. Keeping those feelings in mind, imagine walking up to a woman you've never met and introducing yourself.Repeat this exercise daily for a week, then try it in real life.


If you still don't feel ready, try making eye contact with strangers on the street and saying ""Hello."" Smile, and don't let yourself look away before they do., You might not think of yourself as a skilled talker, but a little advance preparation goes a long way to change that. Keep in mind that the first conversation you have with someone shouldn't explore deep issues of faith, politic stances, or lifelong dreams, unless they're clearly interested. It's just a quick way to get a conversation flowing. Here are some examples of ways you can prepare, depending on your age and the kind of people you spend time with:


Listen to popular music and think about your opinions on it. If you don't like it, find a band you do like and write down how it's similar to more well-known music, and why you like it more.
Watch movies currently in theaters, or currently running television shows.
Read news sites or the newspaper daily to catch up on current events or local news.

, Come up with two or three interesting stories from your life, to tell when the conversation stops. This is a great way to show that you're a cool and interesting person.


If you're passionate about a hobby, talk about it. People are often most interesting when talking about something they love.
Humor is a great tool to use, if used properly. Try to tease yourself or make funny observations about the situation you're in. Teasing the woman or people around you should be kept to a minimum, and should always be light-hearted, not mean.

, The ""brooding guy in a corner"" look isn't nearly as cool or attractive as it seems. Walk up to people and say hi, and make an effort to listen to the conversation and respond to it. The more people are directly interacting with you, the more you'll be noticed by other people in the surroundings.


Don't think of this as ""picking a target."" Talking to men can work fine, as long as they don't try to overshadow you or dominate the conversation.

, When you're looking for someone to approach, scan their faces, not their shoes or the sky – and definitely not anywhere else on their anatomy. Once you make eye contact with someone, smile and say hello. Keep looking at the other person's eyes during the conversation.

, Once you're in conversation with a girl, tilt your head and shoulders forward slightly. This is a cue that you're engaged in the conversation, and interested in continuing it., A small compliment is a much better first step than a long speech about how long you've been crushing on her or how she stunned you as soon as you laid eyes on her. It's tough to come up with a compliment that doesn't sound generic or forced, but with some practice you'll get the smiles and blushes that show you're on the right track.


If you know something about her work or something she did, compliment that instead of her appearance.
Try to make beauty-related compliments unique to her, and focus on something she controls, such as her hairstyle or clothing choices.
A straightforward remark works better than a cheesy pick up line or catcall. ""You seemed so warm and friendly that I wanted to come over and introduce myself"" won't win any prizes, but it will start more conversations than ""Heyyyy sexy.""

By showing you are friendly, honest, and always willing to lend a hand, you will always have someone willing to back you up in times of need.


Practice active listening. Active listening is taking the time to truly listen to what someone is saying. The goal is not to offer solutions to another's problems. Instead, you show that person that you empathize and care for them by listening to their concerns. Listen to them emotionally, not just physically, to truly communicate effectively.Be honest. Admit to your mistakes. Rather than hide something you are ashamed of, tell a friend or family member. This shows that you are not afraid to open up about your insecurities and are willing to seek help when needed. This helps to build trust and respect with those you care about.
Keep in touch with friends. Old friends and classmates are easy to keep in touch with thanks to social media sites such as Facebook. Message or call them from time to time to see what they're up to or invite them out to catch up on the time gone by. It's easy to let some friends fall by the wayside, especially when you begin raising a family or start a new job. Strike the right balance between these activities.Attend social gatherings. Parties, celebrations or other social activities are a great way of keeping in touch with friends and family, and showing them you care. Reserve some time in your schedule if you find free time is difficult to arrange. Create your own social gathering and invite everyone you know if you find hanging out with so many people independently from one another too overwhelming.
Help those in need. Build trust with your friends and family by coming to their aid in times of need. It can be as simple as keeping them company during tough times, or helping plan their wedding. When you help others, you are building a group of individuals that will be there to support you in your time of need.;
, College and other forms of higher education are necessary for many higher paying jobs and open a variety of career opportunities that would otherwise be unavailable. Studies show that individuals who earn at least a bachelor’s degree make 65 percent more income than the median earnings of high school graduates. Take advantage of this financial benefit to build the security people desire in a relationship.Regularly talk to your advisor. The advisor assigned to you when you enter college will be your advisor throughout your entire college career. Speak to your advisor whenever you have questions about what direction you want your education to take. They can advise you on what classes will be useful to you after college, extracurricular activities that will look great on the resume, and internships that can give you real world experience. Take a course dedicated to success in college. College’s offer courses for new students that you prepare for the work ahead. They offer study methods, tips for research and homework, how to have the right mindset and overall goal planning. This course is not mandatory at all colleges, so talk to your advisor if you want to take such a class., Leave college with the same drive and determination you had as when you entered. Listen to your advisor to get a good idea of where to look for your first big job after graduation. Don’t stay too comfy once you land that job – advancing your career is a continuous process. Pursuing your career with drive is a great way of showing your commitment to security throughout your life – an attribute sought after by both men and women, according to recent studies. Turn career planning into a yearly event. Set some time aside each year to review your career up to the present. It’s easy to fall into the habit of reviewing your career only when you feel ready to move on, but keeping tabs on your career on a regular basis helps track your progress and identify where new opportunities are available.
Regular career planning also helps you identify what you enjoy and dislike about your current job. What do you want to change? What would you rather be doing? What do you absolutely need in a career? Ask yourself these questions to get a better handle on where to move next.
Look at the skills you’ve learned in and outside of your current job. It’s easy to forget that we learn a variety of skills in college that can transfer well into several different markets aside from your major. On top of that, there are many skills you perform regularly at your current job that can also transfer into a position that you wouldn’t think to apply for otherwise. Think about the activities you perform at work and those you performed in college and see if your resume or cover letter can’t fit a few new skills.
Set career goals. Update your job and career goals whenever you review your wants and needs for the year. Setting goals is the best way to create a roadmap that will help you achieve the career you want for yourself., It’s never too early to start thinking about your long term savings. Start making long term financial decisions as soon as you complete college.


Speak to an accountant or financial planner. A financial planner will help you create a roadmap to pay off any debt you may have, or help you save the money you need to purchase your first home.
Build your credit early. Apply for a credit card and start building debt as early as possible. Pay off any charges to your credit card immediately to avoid interest and accruing debt. Paying school bills or other loans will also help build your credit.
Set a budget. Stick to a monthly budget to avoid overspending, especially during the financially trying months after college. , Honesty and earnestness have a direct impact on whether others find us attractive, according to some studies. Don’t let your core values fall to the wayside as you move through life. If you value family and intend on raising your own someday, make decisions that allow you to have the time to do so. If spirituality plays an important part in your life, don’t compromise your beliefs in order to land a particular job. Following these values offers the personal fulfillment and connection to others that makes life worth living and marks you as an earnest individual., The same set of clothing can look great on one person and completely ridiculous on another. Identify your body “type” and wear clothes that fit it best.


If you have an average build (with shoulders broader than the midsection and lean legs), you have a good variety of options. Slightly oversized or skinny articles of clothing won’t look out of place on your build.
If your shoulders are wider than average, with a noticeably thinner waist, shirts with horizontal stripes or V-necks can help accentuate your broad features. You may need to purchase a specialized size, such as slim fit, but skinny is likely too constricting for your body type.
For a more rectangular or less defined build, add and accentuate definition where possible. Layer clothing, such as with knit shirts or jackets. Go for skinnier pants to help make the more layered part of your upper body appear broader. Consider sticking with slim fit to avoid clothing that hangs off of your body.
If you have a more pronounced midsection, remove attention from this area with black clothing, which is a slimming color. Vertical stripes can also help you appear thinner. Avoid neckties, turtlenecks and other items of clothing that can cause you to look “squeezed” at the top of your body.
Find a good tailor. A tailor can take your measurements and help adjust clothing to fit your body best., Putting on just the right accessories can make you stand out from the crowd. Choose your accessories according to the clothing you’re wearing that day.


Mix and match your patterns. If you put on a tie or scarf, make sure the colors and pattern do not clash with the rest of your ensemble. You wouldn’t want to wear a vertical stripe tie with a horizontal shirt pattern, or bright neon socks with an otherwise subdued pants.
Contrasting color can work if you plan well. A tie with a color complementary to your shirt can help draw attention to your face, for example.
Pick your shoes carefully. Your shoes can contribute or detract from your overall style just as much as your hat or scarf. Choose shoes that are appropriate for the situation (such as dress shoes for a business situation), and ideally, match their color with the rest of your ensemble.If you wear glasses, pick frames that accentuate the strengths in your face or detract from features you dislike. Much like your body shape, your face shape affects what frames look great on you and which may look strange., Get regular haircuts to avoid a shaggy, unkempt look. Likewise, shave or trim your beard to match your intended style.


If growing out your hair, consider wearing a hat or tying your hair to keep it neat during the growing process.
Avoid particularly strong smelling deodorants and body sprays. You want people to see you coming before they smell you coming. You never know when someone will be allergic to such sprays as well.
Wash your clothes regularly. Iron your clothing if they become wrinkled during storage. Wrinkled clothing is distracting and can give the impression that you don’t care about your appearance.

, Exercise regularly to stay in shape and keep the extra pounds down. You don’t have to be musclebound, but being able to physically perform a variety of activities such as hiking, swimming or jogging, will help you be ready for any activity that comes your way.


Exercise doesn’t always mean hitting the gym. Doing chores more often or walking to the grocery store instead of driving is beneficial to your health as well.
Do yoga or stretching while watching television. This is an easy way of improving your health and flexibility while still indulging in a less than healthy activity.
Stand more often. Prolonged sitting can affect your back and give you poor posture. Whenever possible, stand while performing errands or tasks on the computer in order to relieve your back and burn some calories. , It goes without saying that few people enjoy the company of someone who has a slight odor about them. Cleanliness also helps you stay healthy and keeps acne and infection away.


Brush your teeth daily. Whether you brush twice a day or three times a day depends on the advice of your dentist. Speak to your dentist to understand how often you should brush, for how long, what flossing habits you should keep, and other tips for keeping your smile white and your teeth (and breath) fresh.
Take a shower at least 2 or 3 time a week. Daily showering is not strictly necessary to keep you healthy and clean (and may harm your skin and the healthy bacteria that lives there). How often you should shower depends on your own body chemistry, how active you are and what you do for a living. If you need a shower to get the stink off, feel free. Don’t be afraid to skip a day though. , Confidence has been shown to influence performance in a number of areas. A lack of confidence on your part will affect your entire disposition and others will be able to pick up on this in your mannerisms. Build your self-confidence. Thinking positively, daily affirmations and not comparing yourself to others all help build the self-confidence needed to be your most attractive self.
Though some women enjoy seeing a man take charge, don’t assume that every woman will be as receptive. There is a fine line between taking charge and simply demonstrating confidence in yourself and actions.

, Nothing drives women (or anyone) away like a man who is arrogant and rude. Give respect not only to her, but to those around you as well.


Avoid pickup lines and being overly forward. This gives the impression that you are only interested in something physical. For example: “I lost my number. Can I have yours?”
Open doors and pay for the check if you are inclined, but don’t be offended if the woman would rather you not act chivalrous toward her. Acts of chivalry suppose a level of inequality or difference between man and woman – many women prefer to be treated as equals.
If a woman expresses her opinion or desire, don't try to change her mind. Respect her as a person.
Some guys aggressively follow and hit on women. This is called 'Chasing' and it is a major turn off for most women.

, If you ask a girl what she wants to do on a date and she doesn't give a definitive answer, plan something! Anything you choose will be better than indecisive meandering. Suggestions you offer might spark suggestions of her own.


For example, you might say: ""Hey, I just remembered there's a new art exhibit opening down the street. Want to check it out?""
Bars, coffee shops or parks are all great suggestions for activities.

, People can’t help but remember a charming individual. Someone with charm can win over nearly anyone with a friendly, magnetic personality.



Try wit. Injecting some wit into the conversation demonstrates that you are clever and have a certain wry intelligence that everyone wishes they could possess. Be careful not to push wittiness at the cost the conversation – it’s easy to come off as callous or conceited if you spend the entire time quipping.

Have a sense of humor. Everyone loves to laugh! Start small to test the sense of humor of the person you are with. Crossing the line of good taste is an easy way to tank your reputation and destroy any credibility that you have built.
Avoid making light of particularly sensitive topics. These include sexuality, politics or religion.

, Find out their favorite movie, their ideal date, her hobbies or what kind of upbringing she had. You want to know her as a person, and a good topic can invite discovery on both ends of the conversation. A few good conversation starters include:


”How did college treat you? I never thought I would get out of there.”
“What did you want to be growing up? Do you think college gave you that opportunity?”
”Have you lived here long? I think it has its ups and downs.”
”Ever thought about moving out of state? Where would you go?”

, Show that you have caring side, whether it be for your family or your friends. Even if you lay the wit on thick, knowing that you are an individual capable of actual joy or love makes you a much more attractive person.Help others nearby who are in need of assistance. Such opportunities are numerous and can help demonstrate your propensity for helping others. For example, help someone who needs help reaching the top shelf at a store, or assist someone who appears lost and needs directions.
Offer to pay for a meal or hold the door for a date. Do so out of the kindness of your heart though – not because of set expectations from either party.
Say “Please” and “Thank you.” Basic manners go a long way in demonstrating respectfulness.
Don't be kind to your date and rude to everyone else – this will be noticeable!

, Gifts such as chocolates or flowers can help woo some women, but remember they are gifts. Women do not owe you anything in exchange for these gifts. No one wants to be around someone who whines, begs or gets angry that something didn’t go their way, or feels entitled to reciprocation.

, Despite your efforts, not every woman will be interested. This is okay! We all have our preferences and you may not be everyone’s cup of tea. If your wiles aren’t working on a particular woman, she is probably not interested.


You can’t be everything to everyone. Though you might tailor your approach to someone based on how they appear, don’t change who you are as a result of failure. This is dishonest and shows a lack of confidence.

Be spontaneous and unpredictable.",How to Be a Tease (for Girls)," Confidence demonstrates independence, self-assurance, and a healthy amount of pride. Being assertive, secure, and having a positive self-image are attractive traits because they demonstrate that you don’t need anybody but yourself, which makes time you spend with someone else special and deliberate. Body language is the easiest way to show your self-confidence.


Practice good posture. Sit up straight, don’t slouch or hunch, and hold you head up high.
Keep your eyes up and resist the urge to look down at your feet all the time. Making eye contact shows that you’re open, fearless, and willing to interact.
Avoid fidgeting: it’s a sign of nervousness.;
, Stay calm, act naturally, and don’t try too hard! Avoid forcing conversations and trying to impress others, and don’t be afraid to say “no” or speak your mind. People will be attracted to you because of who you are and what makes you special, not because of who you pretend to be. This applies to how you present yourself as well—through things like clothing and style choices—so just be yourself, and don’t worry about what other people think about you.


Wear outfits that make you feel classy and sensual. Be selective about the skin you show, and only wear what you’re comfortable in.
Avoid excessive makeup. A little bit goes a long way, and most people prefer the natural look anyway.
Remember your natural pheromones are the most attractive smell to compatible partners, even if they don’t consciously pick up on this. That being said, light perfumes are best if you want to wear anything. Try something citrus scented, because citrus smells pleasant, sweet, and fresh.

, They say it takes two to tango, so once you’ve found somebody you want to flirt with, now it’s time to make that person notice you. Getting someone’s attention is easy: all you have to do is make eye contact. But once you’ve done that, look down and smile. It’s called being coy. It’s also an invitation for someone to come over and talk to you.


Add a splash of a vibrant color, like red, to your outfit.
Avoid making the first move. Once you’ve made eye contact a few times and flashed a couple smiles, just wait for that magic to work (and besides, that really was the first move!)
Exude happiness: smile, laugh, and have a great time. Anyone who sees you will want to join in on the fun as well.
Create movement with your body, hands, gestures, or even clothes. Our eyes are attracted to movement, and this is sure to get you noticed., When you’re getting to know somebody, it’s important to show your playful side. Keep the conversation light, be open to new things, and show that you know how to have a good time. Joke around, be lively, and show off your sense of humor.


Avoid serious topics.
Dance together (or own your own) if that’s your thing.
At a party, you can use games to host a friendly competition, or to build a bond by working together. Games also provide a distraction that can help take the pressure off and give you a chance to chat.

, But don’t put all your cards on the table at once. Getting to know someone is a process, and the longer you draw it out, the more stimulating it will be. Show your interest without being too overt; it’s ok to flirt and be suggestive, but be subtle about it.


Don’t immediately come right out and say how you feel, but say something nice. Rather than “I like you” on the first night, try “I like your smile” instead.
Be receptive: smile, make eye contact, and listen.
Body language is the best way to show interest. Face the other person directly, don’t cross your arm, and use facial expressions to show you’re paying attention.

, While we may think that most of our communication is done verbally, in truth body language makes up the lion’s share of human interactions. Body language is actually the first step when it comes to courtship, because it tells a prospective partner if you are receptive and interested. It can also be used as a signal to your love interest that you are expecting an introduction pronto, or that you want to take things further.


Keep your arms open, not crossed. Crossed arms silently say “do not approach.”
Flip or twirl your hair to draw attention to yourself and demonstrate that you’re open to flirtation.
Sit up straight and tilt your head to one side. Lightly stroke your throat or face.Move in closer if you’ve already been approached to demonstrate that the advances are welcome. Lean in when talking, and orient your body so that you are facing each other.
Lick your lips and keep your mouth slightly open. This is a sign of desire.

, The eyes, or so they say, are the windows to the soul, so imagine how much you can communicate just by using them. Facial expressions can also say a great deal about how you’re feeling, often unintentionally.


Lock eyes for a few seconds and then look away if you haven’t been approached yet. Do this about three times, but be sure to smile. This says advances are welcome.Continued eye contact after you’ve been approached means you are still interested.
Look excited and animated. Wide eyes indicate passion and a smile means you are warm and welcoming.
Raise your eyebrows and lower your eyelids, Marilyn Monroe style, to imitate the look of pleasure.Nod your head to show attentiveness.

, Mirroring is the imitation of the body language, speech, and vocal intonations of someone you feel connected to. Although it’s usually a subconscious reflex, the process can be used intentionally to create a bond with someone and build a rapport.


Pick up your drink a few seconds after your companion does, and take at drink following a similar timeframe.
Time your bites if you are out to dinner together so that you are eating in sync.
Change the tone and pitch of your voice to match the passion, excitement, or other emotions your partner expresses.
Avoid mirroring angry or aggressive body language or postures, as this can be interpreted—on a subconscious level—as a threat.

, When attraction is mutual, flirting is a fun and enjoyable behavior that lets two people entertain the idea of being together and feel each other out to test compatibility.This doesn’t mean throwing yourself at someone, but instead giving subtle hints that suggest you feel some chemistry. And the best thing about flirting is that you can do it anywhere!


Flirting is all about letting the other person know you’re interested, so you can flirt with your body, words, gestures, expressions, and even tone of voice.Engage in frequent but light physical contact. This includes a soft but quick touch on the arm or leg as you talk, gently brushing hands, or even touching feet. Establish an intimate space by sitting close and giving the conversation your undivided attention.
Compliment, flatter, and smile. This is welcoming behavior and means you like what’s happening.
At a party or social setting where there are plenty of other possible suitors, try “you know, I’m going to talk to you because you are the cutest one here.”
To get the ball rolling in a shopping setting, ask for help reaching something or request advice about brands. Say, “someone as attractive as you must have a favorite ”
At a restaurant or bar, sit down and request a drink recommendation.
At the gym, try, “I can’t believe how you just crushed that workout! Kudos.”
In any situation, there’s always the classic, “has anyone ever told you that you and could be twins?”

, Playing hard to get is a good way to gauge just how involved someone is (the harder you make it, the more interested the other person is), but remember that this tactic really only works if the person was interested in the first place.After first meeting a new love interest, there’s a fine line between encouraging future advances (being easy to get) and keeping the person interested (playing hard to get), and balance between the two is important. Otherwise, your aloof behavior might scare people off.


Being hard to get isn’t about manipulation, but mystery: it’s all about keeping someone guessing, wondering, and unable to perfectly pin you down. Avoid revealing too much about yourself early on in the relationship.
Make the person aware of your attraction, but stick to your own boundaries while you get to know each other. Don’t feel like you have to be intimate on the first few dates.
Keep your curfew. No matter how great of a time you’re having, don’t stay out all night with your new flame.
Engage in a brief public display of affection if you feel like your suitor might be feeling discouraged.Don’t be afraid to drop hints that you have other suitors who are trying to win your affections.

, You don’t eat the same thing for dinner every night because that would be boring. So why stick to the same patterns and behaviors all the time? By keeping yourself and others guessing what you’ll do or say next, you make life intriguing and fascinating. This doesn’t mean being unreliable or untrustworthy, but rather not being afraid to let loose, relinquish control, and go with the flow now and then. It’s also part and parcel with playing hard to get, because you’ll keep your new partner wondering if you’re fully available. Spontaneity keeps life interesting for everyone involved and helps prevent unexciting routines from forming.


Be curious and open to new things. Break out of old ways of thinking. Try things you think you hate, like new hobbies or foods.
Say “yes”! Go for it next time a friend invites you on a wild adventure. Say “sure” when the near-stranger you met at last week’s party asks you out. Better yet, pick up the phone and initiate a date yourself.
Turn off the TV. Get out into the world and do something, and stop wasting time watching other people live their lives.
Change up regular activities and routines. Experiment with new jogging routes; eat at a new restaurant; have something different for breakfast.
Be fearless. Do things that scare you, and approach all new experiences and situations with bravery and an open mind. Never stop surprising yourself and you are sure to continue surprising others.

If you're dating for fun and companionship, what matters most is how well you get along, right off the bat.
If you're seeking a partner, you should be more willing to overlook initial shyness and awkwardness so that you can get to know a person over more than one date. Compatibility and emotional exchange are important here.
Most of us are looking for a mixture of fun and commitment, but it's important to know where you stand so that you can figure out if your date is on the same page.;
, In today's modern world, it's not enough to know that you want to date. You have to know how you want to date. Because there are several different ways of going about it, each with their pros and cons. Remember that you don't have to stick to any one style. In fact, trying more than one probably increases your likelihood of success:


Try Internet dating. Online dating is the wave of the future. You set up a profile, browse other profiles at your own convenience, and meet in person if you're both willing. Online dating is efficient and great for people who are a little shy (but not only for them). On the other hand, you'll get a lot of people who blatantly lie on their online profile and misrepresent themselves; sometimes online chemistry doesn't translate to actual chemistry.

Find a date at a bar or a club. Approaching someone out of the blue at a club or the bar is hard; you usually need to be pretty confident and comfortable with the opposite sex. But for a good number of people, it totally works. This method of ""dating"" is more informal and usually fling-focused, but it doesn't have to be.

Ask your friend to set you up. Your friends know you well. At least, that's the idea. So why can't they play setup artist? Asking your friends to set you up with someone is usually either a complete disaster or a total success. Why not try it?

, Maybe you tell yourself that looks don't matter when it comes to love. This is true, but only for love, starting out does not count as love. While lasting affection and emotional exchange — the backbone of relationships — have nothing to do with looks or grooming, the initial attraction you feel for another person often does. So always make a good first impression as it goes a long way! Don't forget though, to be yourself, as people do not like superficial dressing, speech or actions. Be your own genuine self, and in the end if your date likes you, you want it to be because he/she likes your personality and appreciates you for you! Not because you happened to put on your makeup well or wore the most flattering outfit. How you take care of your looks says a lot about you.


Guys, check out how to look attractive. You'll want to know what hair to keep and which to style; how to get the clearest skin and when to shave; how to prep your breath for kissing, etc. Don't underestimate this step!
Ladies, check out how to look attractive (for women). Much like guys — but different, obviously — you'll want to know hair, skin, makeup, accessories, and clothing secrets that other women rely on.

, In dating, you're going to deal with rejection. In fact, if you're not getting rejected at some point, you're probably not putting yourself out there enough. If you're outcome-independent, meaning you don't care whether you're welcomed or rejected by a potential date, that rejection isn't going to sting. If rejection doesn't sting, you won't let it keep you from meeting new and interesting people, thereby increasing your chances of success.


Being outcome-independent is a lot easier in theory than in practice. You're going to need to learn how to develop a thick skin in order to really master this. It's worth it though: Too many people let the fear of rejection keep them from getting very far in dating.

, You don't have to hit the bars or the clubs to meet new people, although you can, if that's something you enjoy doing anyway. Pursue interests and activities that mean a lot to you. If you're somewhere where you naturally have fun and you see someone who looks interesting, there's a good chance that you'll immediately have something in common with them. Connection detected!


The internet has made this a whole lot easier. Check forums, listings, classifieds, and Internet mailing lists (known as ""listservs"") for local events or meetings that are likely to attract people with similar interests or passions.
When you're there, be bold. If approaching someone you're interested in isn't really your style, you can still be bold by making yourself look approachable and inviting. Make eye contact, smile, raise your eyebrows — make a connection from across the room.

, A lot of people who swear they hate dating probably only hate small talk. And that's okay, because small talk is extremely hard. You usually know nothing about the person, so you have to search for common ground. Luckily, this is only the beginning of your conversation. Start with small, and once you find some common ground, you can start talking bigger and deeper. Remember, you are your own person. You don't have to pretend you love a certain flavour of ice-cream or that you know everything about a movie you'd never heard of just to impress your date. It's completely okay to disagree and express your own views, as long as you're not being offensive. Here are a few tips that should get you going:



Ask questions. Ask open-ended questions about the other person so that they elaborate. Something like ""So what got you interested in rock-climbing?"" is a lot better than ""Are you interested in rock-climbing?""
Talk about your immediate surroundings. No, this doesn't mean the weather. This means what you both happen to be doing. If you happen to meet someone playing beach volleyball, you can say something like: ""Wow, you're really good. I'll know where to come in the future if I want my butt kicked. Do you play here often?""
Relate to what the other person said. If the other person mentions a physics teacher that they really like and you can relate, don't be afraid to share: ""Yeah, I totally had one of those teachers myself. There's nothing like setting fires and blowing stuff up in class.""

, You're nervous. Suddenly, you trip over your words and say something you think is utterly stupid. What do you do? Instead of acting serious and getting embarrassed, try cracking a smile and making a joke at your own expense. There's no harm! In fact, some people think it's cute if their date is a little nervous. They'll laugh with you and this will break the ice between both of you. It will even get you to loosen up and stop being nervous.


Make a joke at your own expense! ""Wow, I guess I get really tongue-tied in front of a beautiful girl! Good to know!"" This puts both of you at ease and tells the other person that you don't take yourself too seriously. Being playful, in fact, is the most important quality in dating, a study has found., Don't just date anyone who shows an inkling of interest in you. Despite what everyone says about not judging a book by its cover, people who are more discriminating tend to be seen as more desirable, probably because having standards shows that you value yourself and aren't going for a date with whoever crosses your path.At the same time, you don't want to be too selective — if you keep holding out for the perfect person, you're guaranteed to miss out. If you're in a room full of people with similar interests, you should be able to pick out one or two people who you'd like to date — not 10, not 0. Make it a point to not leave the event without showing interest and making a connection with a few people. Trading phone numbers and meeting in person is often a sign that a person desires an actual relationship.
If someone asks you on a date and you're not interested, avoid making excuses like ""I'm busy"" or ""I'm not ready to date right now."" They'll eventually see that you're only too busy for them, and they're the only one you're not ready to date. This can be more hurtful and insulting than just saying ""no"". Handle it gracefully. Smile and say ""No thanks, but I appreciate the offer"" and change the subject to ease any discomfort.

, If you think your first few minutes of interaction have gone well, go out there and say it. It's going to be hard, but you can do it. Don't beat around the bush. As difficult as it may be, the other person appreciates the honesty. You can always say something like:



Sincere: ""Hey, you seem like a really interesting person. Would you maybe want to grab a drink later on in the week?""

Romantic: ""I gotta say, when I saw you from across the room, my eyes lit up. And when we started talking, they lit up even more. Would you want to meet up later for a drink?""

, You want this person to enjoy the date, but you also want them to enjoy you as an individual. Be considerate and charming without looking or acting like someone you're definitely not. Let them discover who you are while trying to maintain a little bit of mystery.



Have good manners. Turn off your phone. The only reason you should be checking or answering your phone is if you're a doctor. Learn your table manners if you're eating food.
Concentrate on your date; don't check out anyone else, no matter how slick you think you might be about it. Don't act uninterested or frown. Gazing off into space while your date is eating or talking isn't good either, and makes it look like you want to get out as soon as possible.
Don't talk about past relationships. This is a no-no and a sure turn-off. You will only project the impression that you are unable to let go. If your partner asks about your last relationship, just tell them that you realized the two of you weren't as compatible as you initially thought, so you have moved on to look for someone with whom to discover greater mutual happiness. Keep it brief and don't ask about their ex.

, Whether it's a rollercoaster ride or a monster truck show, a little excitement does a lot for a first date. Not only is there a distraction that you both can use if the conversation sputters out (which is natural), but there's also chemistry at work. When you engage in an exciting activity with a date, your brain releases dopamine and norepinephrine, which are hormones associated with pleasure, trust, and affection.If you can induce a little bit of dopamine and norepinephrine in your date, your chances at success become better.

, Don't exaggerate or boast about your credentials, successes, etc. Just tell them what you really enjoy in life, what gets you excited and what you want to leap out of bed to pursue. Ask them what they really love in life and what gets them excited. Feel the change in energy during this conversation and revel in it.


Don't forget to add a spark of humor to your conversations. Humor can create a stronger bond of friendship between you two. It is also great to crack romantic jokes, as it brings up the possibility of what might happen between the two of you.

Be positive. If you have had a bad day, still greet them with pleasure and a big smile. Don't show up for your date complaining about the traffic, your boss, or your job. If you must whine, whine a little during dinner and end that very short whine with a ""glad I'm here with you now!"" remark.

, Sometimes, when a date is going really well, your impulse is to keep it going at whatever cost. This is often the wrong approach. End a date after one or two hours, however well it's going. There are several reasons for this:


End on a high note. It's not how you start, it's how you finish. If you stay with someone for 6 hours straight, the end is probably not going to be as exciting as the beginning. Then you leave that memory to linger until you next see the person, which isn't a great feeling.
Don't move at warp-speed from the get-go. It takes time to get to know someone. Don't pretend that it doesn't. Setting a limit of one or two hours for your date gives the other person some space, doesn't crowd them from the beginning. One or two hours is plenty time to decide whether you like the person.
Give yourself plenty of things to talk about. Running out of things to say to one another on the first date can be disastrous. Running out of things to say to one another after the third or fourth date doesn't need to be. Taking shorter dates helps prevent initial burnout.

, Never call, e-mail or text message more than once a day unless they reply. Continue with other activities and let them know you've got a life beyond dating. At the same time, don't get carried away with the ""hard to get"" act — the idea is to overcome any feeling that you ""need"" to call them, or you ""need"" to see them again, or you ""need"" this to work out. The difference between ""needing"" and ""wanting"" is patience.


Don't plan another date too quickly. Your partner (and you) need time to assess your feelings about the date and prepare to accept another one. Within a short time after (1-7 days) call your partner and express your feelings about where to go next in the relationship (like one date at a time, or more dating, or less, or more casual, or more formal, or to cut it off, become friends, or what have you...).

, If you are not ready to be in a committed relationship, let them know straight away so that you do not give them false hope. If you're just not interested in a relationship with them anymore, tell them so. Don't lead them on. Explain that you just don't see it going anywhere. Don't say that you want to be friends unless you actually want to be friends and spend time with this person on a regular basis. If you are interested in seeing this person more often, honesty is still a critical ingredient to a healthy relationship!

, However old you are, punch above your weight. If you just want a casual hookup out of dating, be mature enough to say so from the beginning. Most likely, however, you want something a little more. Show whomever you've started dating that you care about things like honesty, communication, and respect. These things go a long way in attracting the other person to you.


Part of an emotional maturity is being patient about sex. If you're only looking for sex with your partner, then you should find an acceptable way of saying so. Otherwise, don't pressure the other person with sex. Wait for it to happen naturally. You may have to wait several dates for it to even be a possibility.

, Learn to relax and be original. If this relationship goes somewhere, leading to something deeper and more serious, your originality will hold great memories for the other half. We all appreciate the simple sweet gestures, or memories which are likely to bring warmth or a smile to our faces.

, There are a lot of unwritten rules in dating. Knowing what they are and why they're there will help you avoid some embarrassing situations. In no particular order, and not comprehensive:


A kiss is okay on the first date, especially if the date went really well, but it might help to ask. (""Can I kiss you"" is simple and effective.) If you don't kiss the other person by the third date, they may start to ask questions about you. (""Do they like me?"" ""What's their deal?"" etc.)
A man shouldn't feel obligated to pay for everything. A man may offer, like a gentleman would, to pay for drinks or tickets to a movie. (It's recommended.) But going Dutch on a semi-expensive dinner is totally acceptable. (Ladies, don't assume he's always going to pay.)
Don't expect sex on any of the first three dates. Of course, if it's there, and it's natural, go for it. But don't expect it, or you will probably be sorely disappointed.
Don't be afraid to communicate affection. Saying something like ""I really like you; you're a great person"" can mean a lot to your date. Saying the other ""L""-word — ""I love you"" — is probably not recommended during the first month or so of courtship, even if that's the way you feel. Firstly, this is because your feelings might change, no matter how strongly you feel about the person. And the worst thing you could do is to lead the other person with false hope and suddenly reject him/her. Also, you might intimidate the person, which is not something you want to do for sure. Lastly, don't say it flippantly, when you don't really mean it exactly. Don't throw around this word, as it is quite a strong one. It might turn a person off if you say like that.

Wait for them to ask you.,
Talk with your friend about what they want.,
Scan the crowd with your friend for potential people.",How to Be a Wingwoman1," It might be hurtful to your friend if you suggest that you could be their wingwoman, because they might feel criticized for their social skills. They also might not be in the right mood or mindset to meet new potential romantic partners. Therefore, you should wait for your friend to ask you to be their wingwoman., Ask your friend about what kind of person they’re interested in romantically. You can only tell so much about a person by looking at them and talking to them for a few minutes, so take their preferences with a grain of salt. Here are some traits you can ask about:


Height
Hair color
Eye color
Profession
Sense of humor
Depth of conversation
Sense of style

, While you and your friend are getting drinks or putting your coats away, subtly look around to see people you might want to talk to.Look for people who are friendly, engaged, and open to conversation.


If it’s just the two of you, look for a smaller group of people (2 or 3) talking in a group.

"
"
Engage a person or group of people in a conversation.,
Make it clear that you and your friend are not dating, if applicable.,
Steer the conversation towards something that your friend likes.,
Bring your friend away from the person, if necessary.,
Introduce your friend to the person you found for them.",How to Be a Wingwoman2," Go up to a group of people and start a conversation. Try not to be self-conscious; stand up straight, speak clearly, and introduce yourself. Let your friend introduce himself or herself, too.You could try saying something like, “What did you guys order? We’re still deciding!”
Or, “How do you guys know the host? We were in her sorority in college!”

, Misunderstandings are common, especially with people you’ve just met, so make it clear that you are your friend aren’t together. If it’s easier, you can even mention that you’re taken by someone else.


For example, if someone asks if you’re dating, you could say, “Well, I’m taken by someone else, but my friend here is still single!”
Or, you could slyly slip your significant other into the conversation: “My boyfriend doesn’t like this bar, but Joe here knows that they have the best craft beer!”

, When you’re talking to the person you want your friend to meet, steer the conversation in a direction where you know your friend can contribute. Talk to the person for a few minutes to get a sense of what they’re like. Do you think your friend would like them? Do they have a lot to talk about?


For example, if the person you're talking to loves water sports, you could say something like, ""Oh, no way! My friend Mary loves to water ski.""
You could also say something like, ""Oh, you're a Red Sox fan? So is Sue! We just went to a game the other weekend.""

, If they don’t have a lot to talk about, or if you get a weird vibe from the person, take your friend to use the restroom or to get another drink. There’s no point in introducing them if you don’t think they would get along.

, Draw your friend and the person closer together in conversation. If you’ve steered the conversation towards travel, ask the person about where he’s travelled and then mention your friend’s recent travels.


Make the conversation about your friend, not you. You should be able to fade into the background of the conversation and let them keep talking.You should think of a couple really funny stories beforehand that paint your friend in a good light. If the conversation becomes relevant, bring these stories up to talk up your friend."
"
Have a distress signal.,
Leave the conversation.,
Determine if you should return.",How to Be a Wingwoman3," Figure out with your friend beforehand a distress signal that you each can use to get out of a boring or uncomfortable situation. It could be a word or a gesture. Here are some suggestions:Tugging your earlobe
A word you wouldn’t use otherwise in conversation
Winking

, If your friend seems like they're having fun, let them know that you’re going to leave. If they give you a stressed look or your sign of distress, don’t go. But, if they tell you they're having a good time and seem as though they would be okay without you, then leave the conversation. You can chat up other people in the group, use the restroom, or go find someone else to talk to., Don’t ditch your friend with this new person. Gauge the situation to see if they want to be left alone, or if your friend wants you to come back to rescue them. You can shoot them a quick text, or make eye contact with them from across the room. Either way, don’t abandon your friend for the night without checking in with them first."

Don't be too open in the very early days.,
Be honest.,
Speak your mind.,
Be yourself.",How to Be a Good Girlfriend1," Easing into a relationship is about ensuring that there is plenty of space for the two of you to get to know one another and trust that you're right for one another. If you try too soon to ""make"" something more out of your relationship than it already is, premature pushiness can scare them away and spoil what is 'there' to be a good thing. Instead, be patient and realize that it takes time to nurture a solid and enduring relationship. If you want to be a good girlfriend, avoid the following things:


Don't push them to classify your relationship too soon. You don't have to have the label girlfriend or boyfriend after a couple of dates; this risks causing them to feel that the decision wasn't their own. Be patient and let them make up their own mind as to when the definitions, like going steady, exclusive relationship, serious dating etc start being bandied about. If the two of you are compatible, your relationship will develop soon enough.
Don't start talking about marriage or starting a family before you've even met their close friends and parents. Raising such issues prematurely can create tension from the outset and may stall or even bring to an end an otherwise productive and caring relationship.
Don't feel the need to show off or impress them. You don't need to prove anything to them; you simply need to be present and engaged in listening, being attentive and sharing your interests.;
, While being honest to your partner is very important, to the point of being paramount, it is equally important that you are honest with yourself. If you overreact or make a mistake, you can acknowledge your error and apologize. If you're feeling vulnerable or upset, you can sort through your feelings and verbalize them to them in a non-accusing way.


And the most important thing here is that you will be open about your feelings as much as possible. For example, if they do or say something that bothers you, be open about how it impacts you, without being accusing or asking them to change.
If you establish solid lines of communication from the outset, you'll know sooner rather than later whether this relationship will endure or fizzle out.

, Don't be afraid to make your desires, needs, and opinions known, even when they may conflict with your partners'. You don't and shouldn't exist solely to please them. Besides, showing that you are your own person with your own needs, desires, and approach to life will keep them interested in getting to know and understand you as a person. If you're comfortable with speaking your mind, then they'll be comfortable with speaking their mind, too.


Just remember to express yourself in way that doesn't attack anyone else's opinion or lifestyle in any way––you can be humble and outspoken at the same time by using assertiveness strategies and remaining considerate of their feelings too.

, Don't create a fake you just to impress them. It might be tempting if you think they'd prefer a different type of girl but usually this is just cobbling together snippets of things said or suggested and you're likely to be wrong. After all, they want to date you, not some imagined form of perfection. And if you really feel tempted to change things about yourself because they insist that you'd be better thinner, taller, prettier, quieter, whatever, then it's a good indication that you're not compatible.


If they actually say such things to you in a badgering, persistent manner, then it is not love, but an attempt to control you.
Don't pretend that you share their interests if you don't. It might be amusing or ""safe"" to do so initially but it's extremely hurtful when they learn that you don't really love what they love; they could be basing their thoughts about your role in their future on something that isn't real and it'll end up hurting both of you.

End the relationship.",How to Date a Nudist when You Are Not One," Communication is the cornerstone of any successful relationship. Have an open and honest conversation with your significant other about nudism and how the person practices it.Be honest with each other at all times. You should feel no shame or guilt asking the person about nudism. This is not a common lifestyle and the person should understand any questions or concerns you may have about nudism. For example, you can say, “I am sorry if I seem surprised, I’ve just never known a nudist before. Could you tell me a little bit more about it? Does it mean you walk around naked most of the time?”
Give yourself time to process the answers if need be. Remember that nudism does not promote hyper or overt sexuality and this might be a red flag if the conversation focuses solely on sex.;
, Your significant other likely has other traits that define him or her beyond being a nudist. If the naturist aspect of the person’s personality is something with which you have a hard time, then focus on the other things you like about the person. This can help you realize that you and the person are overwhelmingly compatible, even if there is one thing that makes you uncomfortable.


Be honest with the person. You could say, “I’m getting used to you being a nudist, but I really enjoy our long chats about travel over wine and dinner. Can we maybe focus on that for a while?”
Remind yourself of other positive traits whenever you have doubts. Calm yourself by saying, “Ned might be a nudist, but he’s a really great guy who is kind, generous, smart, and a lot of fun.”

, No two people are ever alike. By slowly embracing your nudist’s perfections and imperfections, you might find that the old saying “opposites attract” holds true for you and your nudist.Be aware that it is completely normal if it takes you time to embrace your significant other’s nudism. In fact, you may never get completely used to it. Gradually exposing yourself to the lifestyle may help you embrace your significant other and his or choices more readily.
Remember that you also have quirks about your personality that your nudist might not understand. If you and the person are truly compatible, you’ll be able to get past things you don’t like about the person. If you are unable, that could be a sign that dating a nudist isn’t the right decision for you.

, Another key component to dating or being in a relationship is supporting the person. Even if you don’t understand being a nudist, you can still be supportive of the nudist you are dating. However, remember that support is a two way street and your nudist should also try and meet you halfway, too.Ask your significant other how you can best support his or her nudism. For example, you could say, “I’ve never known a nudist before and I’m trying to get comfortable with your choices because I really like you. How can I best support your decisions or nudist lifestyle?” You might find that the person says “I like you just the way you are and the fact that you’re keeping an open mind is already a huge support.”

, The mantra “don’t knock it ‘til you’ve tried it” may be useful when you’re dating a nudist. If naturism is a completely unknown idea or feeling for you, consider giving it a try. You could try being naked for a few hours or even a day trip to a nude beach if you are comfortable.


Tell your significant other that you’d like to try nudism. Be honest about your level of comfort and ask any questions you might have. You might want to start for an hour in the privacy of your home and gradually spend more time naked if you are comfortable. Only remove clothing with which you are comfortable. Pressure from your partner to do more may be a bad sign.
Try out different levels of nudity. You could start by taking off your top and walking around topless with pants. Gradually remove articles of clothing as you are comfortable.

, You might realize that nudism is not for you, but may not want to give up on your partner. In this case, it’s important to talk to your partner about how to best navigate the dynamic of your relationship. Establishing some set boundaries can help your relationship flourish while ensuring that both you and your partner are able to be yourselves without giving up some aspect of your personality.


Be honest when you discuss boundaries. For example, you could say, “I’m fine with you being naked at home in general, but could you wear clothes when we eat meals at the table together?” You can also say, “I fully support your nudism, but it’s not something that I think I can ever do. So while I’m happy to cuddle with you naked on the sofa, I don’t think I’m going to be able to go to naturist beaches or vacation spots with you. Maybe we can find a place that meets both of our interests.”
Remember to be considerate of your partner’s interest and wishes, too.

, There are many misconceptions about nudism, such as that naturists are always naked. According to the Young Naturists of America, naturism not only promotes nude recreation, but also broader social goals of non-sexualized acceptance of the body and combating bullying.Taking the time to learn more about the naturist movement can help you better understand—and accept—your significant other.


Speak to your doctor about dietary and exercise requirements, including any warning signs of bigger issues for which you should watch.
Consult the wide array of sites about the naturist movement. In addition to the Young Naturists of America, the International Naturist Foundation and Irish Naturist Association offer general information about nudism.However, when consulting the internet, beware of sites that call themselves ""nudist"" or ""naturist"" but are really porn sites. If you see a website that calls itself ""nudist"" or ""naturist"" but is actually pornography, do NOT be fooled into thinking that this is what nudism is about, and is what your partner must be doing.


Talk to a doctor or mental health professional about nudism if you are concerned there is something wrong with your date. The doctor can explain to you that the desire to be naked during times of recreation is entirely normal. How you receive the concept is ultimately up to you, though.

, Every individual has perspectives and opinions based on life experiences. Your truth is not the only or correct view. Recognizing that nudism is a legitimate life choice may help change your attitude towards it.


Think about all of the other types of lifestyles that people have. Naturism promotes loving and accepting every individual in a non-judgmental manner. Keep in mind that your nudist is not harming anyone or anything and as long as he or she remains that way, the person’s life choices are valid.

, If you are having qualms about dating a nudist, talk to a close friend or loved one. This person may be able to help you focus on the positive traits of your nudist. He or she may also make you realize that nudism is one small part of your significant other in contrast to so many other wonderful qualities.


Consider your nudist partner’s “out” status before talking to someone else. Some nudists may simple enjoy being naked in their homes and don’t share this aspect of their lives with others. If this is the case, avoid talking to someone else—friends, loved ones, or otherwise-- about your partner’s nudism.
Be open and honest with your conversation partner. For example, say, “I’m having such a hard time getting used to the thought that whenever we are at Lucy’s place, she is naked. It makes me think of sex and I know that isn’t her intention. How do I get over this?”
Ask if your friend has ever had similar experiences on which you can draw. Be aware that friends and family members may have concerns or even prejudices about dating a nudist, so remember to take any friendly alarm with a grain of salt. You can also use it as a chance to explain exactly what naturism is since the person may not know.

, Maybe you grew up in a home where the body and nudity are taboo. It’s important to acknowledge that your own life experiences may be coloring your attitude towards your nudist—and not for the better. Once you’ve done this, you can begin to reframe your attitudes. This may make you more accepting of your nudist’s lifestyle choice.


Take some time and write out your attitudes towards nudity and the human body. Look at them and see if there are any things you can gradually change. For example, you might notice that you think it’s shameful to show your most private areas to others. However, you could reframe this and say to yourself, “wait, everyone has genitals. They might be used for sex, but they also serve other important functions.”
Be honest about your attitudes so that you can begin to make changes if you want., If you are unfamiliar with nudism, you might find that dating a naturist can be slightly stressful in the beginning because you’re not sure how to act. If being around nudity stresses you, consider only meeting your significant other at venues where the person has to wear clothes. You can always gradually allow yourself to get used to the person’s lifestyle. This helps manage stress and promotes your overall well-being.


Avoid questions about your partner’s nudism from others if it makes you uncomfortable or causes you stress. Simply say, “Ned’s a great guy and we don’t need to talk about his lifestyle.”

, Having time to yourself is an important part of any relationship and maintaining your well-being. Make sure you have plenty of “me time” to get your mind off of any stress or discomfort you feel with your partner’s nudism.


Do activities with other people who are not nudists.
Consider going to yoga or getting a massage. Both can help de-stress you and a massage may help you more easily and gradually embrace that sometimes people are naked.
Avoid feeling guilty for taking some time to yourself. Remind yourself—and your nudist-- that this is important for you and the health of your relationship.

, If you want to be more open with your nudist and are having trouble for any reason, consider getting professional support. This could entail seeing a therapist or life coach or even joining a group therapy session. You may find that talking about your issues with nudism or how you can best accept it with strangers can help you more readily embrace the relationship for its other facets.

, You may have a very difficult time dealing with a person’s nudism, even if you’ve tried methods to accept the lifestyle. If this is the case and you can’t get past your problems with the person’s life choices, then you might want to end the relationship. Although it might be difficult, it might be the best thing for both of you.


Tell the person the truth about why you are ending the relationship. You could say, “I really like you and enjoy spending time together, but I am having a really hard time with you being a nudist. It really causes me a lot of stress and I’m afraid it’s going to affect our relationship. I’d really like to stay friends if you are open to that.”

"
Determine if you're still new to each other.,
Notice if you're focused on physical attraction.,
Look out for attempts to impress.,
Assess if you've committed to dating.,
Pay attention to expectations

As you begin to date more, you’ll likely establish expectations of one another.",How to Assess Your Relationship Stage1," The early stages of a relationship are characterized by infatuation and spending more time with someone. Observe if you're still asking about the person's likes and dislikes, his hobbies and interests, and his beliefs. Notice if you are evaluating his personality characteristics and habits to see if they’re compatible with you.You’ll want to assess if you’re comfortable enough to continue being around him. For example, you may ask yourself:Is this person caring and friendly?
Is this person controlling or mean?
Does this person have a tendency to be unhappy or irritable?
Is this person generally fun to be with?;
, Notice if you idealize your partner, get easily excited by her, or think of her frequently.If you are not able to recognize her flaws, then you're still in the romantic infatuation stage.You're probably experiencing these physical signs of attraction when your partner enters a room:Blushing.
Trembling hands.
Racing heart.
Feeling weak or faint.

, Ask yourself if you are on your best behavior, go out of your way to please the other person, or make attempts to flatter and flirt. If so, you're likely still in the infatuation stage of dating, where there is more pressure to impress and build connection. You’ll be so excited by the attention you’re getting that you’ll try your best not to make a mistake.For example, you may spend extra time getting ready for dates, say “yes” to activities you might not normally do, buy or wear nicer clothes, and spend more time with him than by yourself or with other friends.
Keep in mind the importance of boundaries. For your relationship to grow and be successful, you’ll need to learn to be authentic and stop trying to impress your partner all the time. Giving up time with friends and family is not healthy for your relationship long-term., If you're spending more time together, feeling more comfortable with her, and getting to know her beyond the basics, you're now in an exclusive dating relationship. At this stage, you'll be discovering who the person really is and observing your compatibility on a deeper level. Ask yourself if this person:Understands how to comfort you and provide support.
Trusts you and is comfortable being honest with you.
Respects your family and friends.
Understands your sense of humor.

, Your expectations may be different and may affect the ability for your relationship to last. If you're considering these qualities and needs more, you're moving out of the infatuation stage and into a post-honeymoon type stage of more realistic love.Think about:

How you like to spend your free time, whether with friends or together.
How much alone time you need.
Who will pay for things when you go out together.
How much physical touch or affection you need.

"
Take an interest in their interests.,
Learn to work as a team.,
Compliment them more than you criticize them.,
Learn to compromise.,
Give each other space.",How to Be a Good Girlfriend2," Remember what they like to do and what they like to talk about. You don't have to act like you love their hobbies, but at least try to understand why they're such a fan. If they love a band, try to understand why. If they just love to be playful and immature, remember that it might just be their way of releasing stress. In learning to accept their unique way of being, you'll also be learning more about yourself and ultimately whether you could see yourself spending the rest of your life with this person.


You don't have to take an interest in all of their interests. If they enjoy watching baseball but you just can't get into it, that's fine, too.
Just asking about their interests and talking about the things that matter to them can be enough.

, As in any healthy relationship, you'll experience your share of conflicts, some tiny, some big. Remember to be true to yourself and try to abandon any significant selfishness. A relationship is a matter of teamwork and a symbiotic relationship, not a parasitic one, where a party gives and the other one just takes without giving enough back. In a team, you have each other's back, you don't undermine one another and you openly cherish each other in front of others.


In times of hardship, a team approach can help you to work through problems in a less emotionally attached way, in that both of you assume responsibilities for fixing things rather than expecting one or the other to fix things.
Avoid having a ""one track"" relationship in which the bond revolves around one thing. Keep your relationship strong by bringing variety and diversity into the relationship. Try different and new things together. Relationships are about having fun together, learning together and growing together.

, If everything you say around them is a criticism or an attack, they won't look forward to seeing you and they'll start reconsidering being with you. All the same, you don't always have to agree with them just because they are your partner. Tactfulness is a better strategy in mature relationships and establishing boundaries and making compromises are important relationship strategies to learn and adopt.


Though you can bring up a valid criticism when it feels right, you should say at least four positive things about them for every negative thing you say.
Don't nag them just because you're in a bad mood or things aren't going perfectly.

, If you want to be a good girlfriend, then you have to learn to compromise instead of fighting or being angry the second you don't get your way. To compromise well, you both have to be able to calmly and rationally discuss a situation while understanding the other person's perspective. Try to understand where your significant other is coming from instead of blindly focusing on what you think you need.


You don't want to be that girl who always gets her way just because your partner would rather give in than stand their ground because you get so angry and upset whenever things don't go your way.

, You should support your partner, but you should also be able to ""be there"" for them in spirit when you're not actually around. If you want to be a good girlfriend, then you have to make time to do your own thing, to hang out with your girlfriends, and to see your partner. They should know that you're thinking of them and rooting for them even if you're not around. If you feel insecure and doubt the strength of your relationship the second you're apart, then you have a problem.


You should support your partner if they just want to have a night out with their friends instead of trying to intrude. It's important to allow your significant other to have time to spend with their friends and hang out without you.
If you feel entitled to all of their time and attention, learn how to not be an obsessive girlfriend. Don't be an overly protective girlfriend; let them go out without them feeling watched.
Remember that they don't need you for everything and that you are separate people as well as a couple. When they need some space, don't take it personally–recognize it for what it is–their time to rejuvenate and to share different interests with others. But do make sure they know that you're always there for them.

Be affectionate.,
Be seductive.,
Give them gifts.,
Don't get jealous.",How to Be a Good Girlfriend3," There are various ways to show your affection; some are more obvious than others and the way you approach this will depend on how openly affectionate you like to be personally. Affection is close to but not the same as intimacy––affection is about openly displaying that you care about this person and can be shown any time of day or night, publicly or privately. Think about how you like to show affection to people you care about, such as holding hands, touching an arm, quick kisses on the cheek, a hug, stroking hair, supportive words, mentioning how great someone is in front of other people, etc.


Pet names like ""Baby"" or ""Sweetheart"" are a cute way to show your affection for your partner. Try not to overdo this, however. It can be a major turn-off if you call them ""Mr. Cuddle-Bear"", especially in public. Of all things, good communication is the vital part of any relationship, so make sure that they know how much you like them.
Regular lovey-dovey texts and emails can be a plus, but too many will become overwhelming and you may seem clingy. These types of things do show you're into them, and you want it to last forever, but don't come on so much that you scare them!

, Don't be afraid to be seductive. Most people find it irresistible when a girl is sexy, classy and confident. Confidence means being happy within your own skin; you will exude this without trying if you are accepting of yourself and feel secure about your own worth. You don't have to force yourself to be the most popular, bubbly personality if that isn't your style; rather, be the best you on show by taking good care of yourself and trusting that you're worth their attention.

, When you're in a relationship, it's fun to give each other small gifts. Everyone loves to get presents and giving them one shows that they mean a lot to you. Don't overdo it -- just give them a gift when you're feeling loving and want to let them know how much they mean to you. You don't want them to think you're trying to buy their affection.


Make them something by hand. A paper flower, an artsy heart, something creative that reflects your personality, so that whenever they look at it, they'll think of you and smile. If you're the musical type, or play an instrument, feel free to play them a song or two (bonus points if you play a song you wrote yourself). Add a private video of your song to YouTube.

, You should be loving, but not to the point where you start seeing red the second your partner talks to, or even just mentions, another girl. Nothing will turn your significant other off faster than a girlfriend who is so insecure that she can't stand the thought of other women existing in the universe. Your partner will appreciate you even more if you're nice to their female friends instead of talking about how ugly or annoying any girl you see is.


If they're out with their friends, don't text them every two seconds to make sure they're not talking to other girls. This will only make your partner see how little you trust them.

See if you are accepting of your partner's imperfections.,
Observe how you manage miscommunication.,
Determine your level of trust.,
Listen for talk of the future.,
Notice if you're establishing a shared life.",How to Assess Your Relationship Stage2," Are you aware the other person’s faults and quirks? If so, then you’re in a normal phase of realistic love in which you may no longer see your partner through rose-colored glasses, but instead start to notice the things that might annoy or irritate you. It's okay to notice these things — no one is perfect, and your partner is going to start noticing quirks and imperfections about you, too. What's important is figuring out if you can accept these things about your partner.Are you starting to notice that your partner never cleans up the dishes after eating? Or have you noticed larger issues you may need to work on, like that he often says he is fine when he's actually very upset?
If you cannot tolerate the other person's faults at this stage, or feel that they are things that the two of you cannot work on, you might decide to move on from the relationship., Once you start to become more intimate with your partner, you’ll likely have more arguments and disagreements. If you're willing to compromise and put your partner or the relationship first, then you're beginning to be in a more committed and content phase of your relationship.Disagreement is unavoidable, but you can learn to communicate better with your partner by:Listening attentively
Avoiding judgments or blaming
Asking for clarification
Rephrasing or repeating to show you understand
Talk about hard topics such as hurt feelings

, Ask yourself if you can get what you need from one another. The success of building a relationship will depend on if you can trust each other to be there. If you are both turning toward one another and listening to each others’ needs, rather than getting angry or denying what your partner needs, then you are certainly in a phase of contentment.To assess your level of trust, ask yourself if you are able to:Be vulnerable in sharing your concerns and insecurities to your partner.
Be open to what the other person is feeling.
Avoid getting angry, jealous, or possessive.

,

If you’re in a healthy, contented relationship, you’ll start to share dreams for your future together at this point. You’ll start imagining more possibilities with one another. You’ll feel comfortable sharing with your partner what you see for your future.You can ask yourself if your partner:Is invested in growing with you
Has similar ideas about marriage and family
Is motivated to make and achieve goals with you

,

In the contentment or co-creation phase, you’ll face new challenges and may have to put your relationship first.You'll also recognize your partner’s need and your own need for independence, while still working to establish a new routine and life now that you’re more of a team.In this phase, it’s common you’ll have to negotiate new roles and rules because of:Adopting a pet
Moving in together or buying a house together
Thinking about engagement or marriage
Sharing or merging finances

Work as a team.,
Pay attention to boredom.,

Notice if you take time for your relationship.,
Look out for continued respect.",How to Assess Your Relationship Stage3," Notice if you are continuing to build commitment and loyalty by working together. Relationships take continual work and support, even if you know each other well and have been together for a long time.In a more mature stage of love, you will:Rely on each other.
Fulfill or follow through on promises made.
Feel comfortable with the roles and responsibilities you’ve established with each other.
Feel comfortable going to your partner when you’re struggling.

, Once you’ve been committed for awhile and some of the romance has faded, it can be difficult to know if you’re still in a healthy relationship. Examine if you’re feeling bored or frustrated with your routines with your partner. If so, you may be experiencing stagnancy.Schedule time for something fun.
Do something active together.
Be open to new activities.
Try something you each enjoyed as kids.
Avoid activities that are too competitive.

, At the committed stage, partners usually know each other very well, and can anticipate what the other may need during hard times or on a daily basis. Knowing and caring for your partner's needs before she asks is a great way to care for her daily.

For instance, if you know your partner has had a stressful day, take it upon yourself to have dinner ready when she gets home from work and do the clean up, too. Or if she's been going through a rough time, encourage her to have a girl's night with her friends — let her know she shouldn't feel guilty for not including you, and to go out and enjoy herself.
If you aren't sure what your partner's wants and needs are, then you need to have a discussion. Sit down and ask her what she wants and needs from the relationship, and don't interrupt her or get defensive. Then take your turn.

,

If you have children and/or jobs, it can be difficult to maintain a healthy, stable, loving relationship in the face of other tasks and roles. Notice if you’re multi-tasking more, making more time for the kids or work, and spending less one-on-one time with your partner. If so, you may be experiencing stagnancy and need to remember to:Express appreciation to your partner. You might say, “Thank you for making me coffee this morning. You make it so much better than I do and it saves me time. I love that you do that for me.”
Express affection. Know what your partner likes and surprise him with it. It could be a hug, a simple “I love you,” a card, or flowers.
Listen to your partner. Take 20 minutes every day with each other to listen to what happened in your lives. Don’t try to fix anything or judge, just listen and decompress together.

, If you continue to treat your partner as valuable, even if you disagree with her opinions, you're in the commitment phase. You'll be able to once again accept your partner for who she is, faults and all. You'll learn to manage or let go of your expectations of your partner at this stage. If you can't, or if you notice increased conflict or disrespect in your relationship, seek counseling.Violence is not healthy or acceptable at any relationship stage. Seek help from a counselor or domestic violence shelter if your partner become violent or verbally abusive.

Flirt physically.,
Make eye contact.,
Eat.,
Keep yourself clean and trimmed.,
Exchange phone numbers, email addresses, etc.,
Ask the person out again, if it's clear you should take the initiative.,
Never say ""nothing"" if a guy asks what your interests are.,
Make plans.",How to Attract the Opposite Sex," This begins before you even leave the house. Are you going to get some coffee at your favorite café? Walk past a full length mirror before you take off. You may like to lounge around in pajamas while at home, but that's not a way to grab someone's attention when you're out and about.


Buy clothes that you feel comfortable in-- you don't want to look stiff. The whole point is that you show you care about how you look, but not too much.
Dress appropriately; if tonight's plans are to go to the hip industrial dance club, then by all means, wear your Doc Martens and leather wrist bands. Just don't go from the club to the uptown bar unless you truly think you can pull it off. Being comfortable starts by not addressing stares. More importantly though, looking good often means feeling good and that definitely pays off.;
, Aside from what you are wearing, always remember that the mind is the largest erogenous zone. Be culturally aware and interesting. Knowing a little bit of most topics. Truly knowing about the things that really interest you will genuinely make you a more interesting person.


Music seems to link many people together. Knowing about bands you don't even listen to is a great social lubricant because ""not knowing"" shuts down avenues of conversation dead in their tracks. However, saying you've heard Joy Division and really like ""She's Lost Control,"" but think it's a little monotonous shows the other person that you've already given something they like a try to don't like it; likewise, this gives you a little time to catch up and formulate a change in topic, thus steering the conversation into more familiar territory.
Know yourself well enough that you feel comfortable disagreeing. Nothing is more boring and pointless than someone who always agrees. The other person could be so attractive your eyes glaze over, but listen to them really process what they are saying. Allow the words, ""I totally disagree..."" to roll off your tongue. This doesn't make you a jerk. It makes you a better person because you're putting yourself out there. Plus, it cuts down on your vulnerability to the other person and transfers it to them.

, It'll make them feel more comfortable, confident, and relaxed around you. Just don't overdo it.

, Any style will do, as long as it's your own. Uniqueness is crucial because it is what differentiates you in the sea of ""other fish"" this person has no doubt been told are out there. If you really like that goofy hat at the vintage clothing store and you think it looks good on you, wear it out. Don't be discouraged if people think you're goofy, chances are you wouldn't even want to meet those people anyway.

, This not only shows them that you're flattered with them, it also shows that you are noticing their actions.

, Casual touches are a great way to gauge the direction of things. If the other person seems comfortable with you touching their hand or brushing their arm, then you have a good litmus for their attraction to you.


You may want to start by simple flirting.

, Look into the other person's eyes whenever talking. The eyes have been called the window to the soul. Admire them. Genuinely appreciate the other person. Just don't stare for too long. Studies have shown that a person generally will gaze into another person's eyes for about 4.5 seconds if they are attracted to them.

, If you are self conscious about your weight, hashing out that insecurity by forgoing a meal in front of the person you like is not the right thing to do. It makes people uneasy when the person they are with is basically watching them eat.

, Clearly, you wouldn't want a smelly trash monster in your bed, so don't be a stink factory. Also, if you find yourself a little less than fresh in the wrong place at the right time, freshen up in the bathroom first. Easily explain this to the other person by telling them to ""wait"" gently.


If someone should joke about their hygiene, cut them some slack and joke with them about it to ease the tension.

, Often the hardest thing isn't the ""waiting three days"" part, it's the time when you need to pop the question.

, You should gauge who needs to do this by your first meeting. Feel out what you have been talking about. Maybe the other person needs to get off the train at the next stop and you've been talking for the past 15 minutes on your way to work. In that case, ask them if you can call sometime. However, maybe you just bumped into someone at the bar and chatted for a few minutes; in that case give them your number and tell them you'd like to go out sometime. The difference is always in the comfort level you and that person have established. Obviously asking someone you barely know for their number is awkward for both of you, but if you've had enough time to build a decent connection then it's easier for the other person to give up those precious digits.

, Don't say ""eh nothing"". Talk about it. He obviously wants to know. Even if it's something extraordinary, don't make a fuss about it.

, This might sound totally crazy, but in the initial few weeks of dating it's nice to know there is a regular schedule that the two of you can count on. If you feel brave, call the person and ask them what they are doing a few days ahead of the ""date day"" and then tell them something came up and reschedule. Only do this if you need to build tension. Exercise common sense; but at the same time, this gets the other person stewing if they really wanted to see you in the first place.

Keep your body clean.,
Wear nice clothes.,
Smell amazing.,
Maintain your body.",How to Attract Women Without Doing Anything1," Girls don't want to deal with your week-old BO. Man, YOU don't want to deal with your week-old BO. Take regular showers and use deodorant. It will surprise you how much of a difference this makes if you haven't been doing this already.;
, It's not like you have to go around wearing Armani or anything, just wear clothes that fit, suit your body, don't have holes or stains, and don't look like they were the height of fashion in 1986. Don't worry so much about brands: a girl worth having won't care what brand of clothing you wear. Just make sure you're dressed such that she wouldn't be embarrassed to be seen with you.

, Just like you love a girl who smells like a perfect princess fresh out of fairy land, girls love it when men smell amazing too. You can do this by first keeping your body clean, and then adding a nice scent. This can be as simple as getting a really nice smelling deodorant. If you want to go a bit further, you can try cologne or body sprays. Just make sure that the smell is subtle and that you put it on correctly. She doesn't want you to smell like you bathed in Axe.

, Just like guys usually prefer a fairly skinny girl, girls usually prefer decently fit guys. Don't feel like you have to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, because she won't care so much whether you have a six pack or not...just get yourself to a point where you're healthy and comfortable...say, walking up a large hill. This will make you feel better in your own skin and help attract women.


It's not that they're vain or hung up on societal ideas about weight, it's more that not exercising shows that you don't really care about yourself enough to keep your body healthy (even if that's not true).
If you've both got a couple of extra pounds, you better be prepared to work on your own weight if you're going to ask her to work on hers.

Did you and your significant other simply grow apart or did something happen that made you stray? It’s important to understand why you started dating another person in order to make the break up as painless as possible. Make a list of at least three reasons why you may have mentally left your original relationship and started dating another person.


How compelling are the reasons? Are they enough to stay with the new person or do you feel that this has been a big mistake? You need to know this now before you're a pond full of regrets.;
, Perform the same mental analysis with your new steady as you did with your original mate. Why did you start dating this person and what attracted you to the relationship? Most importantly, does the new person know that you're currently dating someone else? If your new boyfriend or girlfriend is in the dark, this may cause problems later down the road, especially if you become serious and yet you've not acted as if you have treated the relationship seriously. As with your original mate, list three or more reasons why you have entered into this new relationship and how it will differ from the previous relationship.


Are these reasons compelling enough to want your new date to completely take the place of your current lover? Again, ensure that there is no ambiguity in your reasoning.

, Timing is everything. Avoid major life events such as holidays, birthdays or anniversaries––especially if the anniversary marks a sad occasion such as the death of a loved one. Select a totally random day––one that should have no meaning to you or your current mate. However, don't use an inability to select ""the right day"" as an excuse not to get this over and done with. The sooner that you deal with breaking up, the better for both of you.

, Always break up in person––never on the phone, by mail or text. You owe the other person a face-to-face meeting. However, if you believe the break-up could be filled with intense drama, choose a public place, but avoid crowded, intimate restaurants. If your significant other decides to explode, he or she may not be concerned with the surroundings and have a very public reaction. Additionally, consider a place where you can make a quick getaway. Waiting to pay for the check at a restaurant can be very awkward, so head to a destination that will provide you with mobility. Some suggestions for places include:


A spacious outdoor park (away from kids and playground equipment)
A shopping mall
The gym
A coffee shop
A bar and grille
The beach
An athletics park.
Places to avoid:

An intimate restaurant
Your favorite place to go as a couple
The movies
Your or his/her home––however, some people feel more comfortable breaking up with someone from their own home turf if they're the only one living there, so this depends on the context
While on vacation
A play or concert.



, If you haven’t already told your new steady that you had someone else, now is a good time. If you want to have a strong, honest relationship with your new boyfriend or girlfriend, it’s imperative you alert your new honey to the situation. Along the same lines as breaking up with your other mate, choose a random day and place to tell your new boyfriend/girlfriend about the other person.


Begin the conversation by reinforcing your feelings for him/her.
Explain how your life has changed since you met him/her.
Discuss your plans for the future with the new person.
Gently tell him or her that you have current boyfriend/girlfriend, but that you will be breaking up on a certain date and why you plan to break up.
Reassure your new boyfriend/girlfriend that the break-up will truly result in the end of that relationship.

, Don’t tell the other person over the phone, email or text why you want to meet, but simply ask if you can meet on a certain day and time to talk. Don’t make a lot of small talk on the phone and definitely do not say things like, “I love you” or “I miss you.” Avoid confusing the situation--even if the other person is the one who says it first. Stand strong but be gentle.

, If you have to rehearse the delivery, do it. Just don't have notecards out in front of you and refer to them while you're breaking up. Punctuate the other person’s positive qualities first but make no qualms about why you're there––to break up. Ask the other person if they were truly happy in the relationship. You may be surprised to learn that he or she wasn’t happy either. (Be prepared for them to say they were though, in which case, asking them will backfire on you and you'll have to apologize and recognize that they were happy but explain that you're still not.) Other points to consider:


Avoid telling the other person that they drove you into the arms of another––that will only escalate into an unproductive discussion and says more about your inability to be independent-minded than it does about them. It's not a tactic to escape unscathed; it's a way of telling your soon-to-be ex that you're making excuses.
Don’t lead the other person on to think that you could possibly get back together. Make it clear that it's over.
Don’t point fingers––it takes two to make a relationship work (or not work). Acknowledge your own faults, lack of participation and inability to contribute fully to the relationship.
Don't drag out the past––remain in the “here and now” instead of talking about the time he or she kissed someone else, for example. The idea is to not apportion blame or to try to make your soon-to-be ex look bad; rather, help them to see that this is ultimately a good decision for the two of you.

, Show the other person respect by being prompt and exactly in the place where you agreed to meet, at the time you agreed. If you know that they're never prompt, take something along to do to pass the time so that you avoid getting frustrated waiting for them. Take a book, your eReader or play phone games. Just resolve to stay calm until they arrive (and after, of course).

, Keeping in control of a conversation means being ready to open it and to lead with the news of the break up as quickly as possible. Also be prepare to ask questions as much as or more even than you're asked questions, questions about how the other person is taking the news, how they're feeling and what they'll do next. By making them respond to your questions, it shows that you care enough about their welfare to be interested but also deflects a focus off you all of the time, as they're forced to think over how they're taking it and how they're going to move on.


All the same, anticipate the possibility that your significant other could flip out so keep that in mind during your break up delivery. If you remain calm, perhaps you can tone down the situation.
If they have items in your home, be sure to allow them plenty of space to retrieve their things without pressure or anxiety. You could even offer to have them delivered but don't sound like you don't want them to collect their own things if they want to.

, Don't allow the break up to last more than an hour. You owe the other person the time to discuss his or her feelings, but you don’t want to drag the break up out for hours; doing so will just encourage unhealthy wallowing and your ex will be tempted to raise a whole raft of reasons why this shouldn't be happening and why you need to reconsider. Have a good excuse ready such as meeting someone else, having to get work done or needing to get to bed early for an early meeting, etc. Offer to drop them back home if it helps or to shout them a taxi ride.

, This may be impossible, especially if the other person wasn’t expecting it or didn’t want to break up. If the other person storms off, there is nothing you can do. However, if you can end it amicably, wish the other person well and you can even hug. Don’t make plans to see them soon or say, “Let’s be friends.” The break up is still too fresh to identify any future plans or friendship dynamic.

, They will need to be sure that you went through with it and that things are truly over and done with, allowing the two of you to proceed forward happily and with strength as an unencumbered couple.

For example, if you’re a bookworm looking to attract bookworms, don’t dress wear platform heels, short skirts, and heavy makeup just because that’s what you see working in the movies!


You should never dress to what you think a guy might like. Dress to the image of yourself that you want to project. This will attract the kind of guy who’ll like you for you.;
, While you want to turn a guy’s head, you don’t want to do it for the wrong reason. For example, you might look out of place dressed to the nines at school, even if your outfit is great. Don’t wear regular “hang-out” clothes to someone’s fancy party.

, No two girls have the same body, so you shouldn’t choose your clothes based on someone else’s body. Do a little research into how to style your body shape, whether you have a pear-shaped figure, an hourglass figure, or a curvier figure.


If you have skinny legs and a small waist, wear skinny jeans or pants.
If your waist is curvier, wear straight-leg jeans or pants that draw more attention to your hour-glass shape.
If you have a very slight frame, loose-fitting styles might look too baggy on you.
Girls with a curvy waistline should try out A-line dresses, which tend to flatter those curves.

, Even if you don’t want the “heavy makeup” look, a little bit of foundation and lip color can bring out the most beautiful details on your face.

Check your makeup in the mirror a couple times throughout the day, touching it up as necessary.

, When you feel beautiful, you’re more confident, and confidence attracts guys.Play around with your hair in the privacy of your own home, trying out different styles until you figure out how you feel most confident. Take into consideration how long it takes to style your hair that way, because you don’t want to get up an hour early every morning just to fix your hair.


Sleeping with your hair in braids can give it a soft, easy wave.
If you use a straightening iron, make sure to protect it with the appropriate styling product, or you may end up with heat damage.
If you don’t have a curling iron, you can use your flat iron to curl straight hair.
If you have long hair, trying pulling it up off your face in a top knot, or a messy bun or ponytail.

, The first thing a guy will try to work out about you is whether or not you’re in the mood to talk. If you want a boy to talk to you, you need to look like you’re open to conversation!


Many boys find it extremely attractive when a girl smiles at them. Remember not to smile too widely or you'll just look silly! A small, flirty smirk is perfect, and showing your teeth demonstrates confidence.

, This is another way of showing that you’re confident in yourself. You’re not afraid of being caught looking at him, and you’re not afraid of your feelings.


While it’s good to make eye contact, make sure you’re not staring at him adoringly from a distance. You want to look interested and open, but not obsessed!

, If you’re always alone when the guy you like sees you, he might think you don’t have any friends because you’re not fun to be around. If he sees you laughing and making others laugh, he’ll be able to tell that you’re a fun girl that he should probably try to get to know.


A lot of girls do a “fake laugh” when trying to get boys’ attention, but don’t do that! It’s very obvious that the laughter is forced, and it sometimes sounds silly and obvious.
It’s better to pay attention to what your friends are saying and actually respond to conversation cues. This way, your laughter will sound genuine and beautiful, and you’ll still be having fun by laughing and bonding with your friends!

, As nervous as you are about talking to him, he might be just as nervous about talking to you! While in the past, it might have been considered forward for girls to initiate conversations or relationships, we’re well past those days. Be the brave one!


A good ice-breaker is to ask him for a favor.For example, if you’re in a class together, ask him if you can borrow his notes for a night. That can start a conversation about the material you’re learning in class, or about the teacher, etc. You’ll also get to follow up your conversation when you return the notes to him the next time you see him.
Make a friendly observation or statement like “the homework was really hard last night” or “I can’t wait for the weekend.” Give him something to hang onto so he can enter into a conversation with you.

, Don’t worry about his first impressions of you, because studies show that first impressions don’t really matter that much in the dating game.It’s far more important that he gets to know the real you. If you put on an act to get a boy to like you, he might want to date you, but then you’ll have to pretend to be that imaginary girl the entire time you’re together. You want him to know exactly who you are and what you’re like from the first time you talk.


If he says something you disagree with, don’t be afraid to get into a good-natured debate with him. This doesn’t mean to pick a fight — just don’t be afraid to voice your own opinions in the course of regular conversation.
If he says something funny, laugh! But don’t laugh at every single thing he says — you’ll sound forced and fake.

, Body language can be termed as “positive” or “negative,” and if either of you are giving off negative vibes with your body, this might not work out.Read his body language to see how he’s responding to the conversation. Adjust your body language to let him know that you’re enjoying yourself.


Positive body language is marked by leaning or moving closer, having a relaxed posture with legs uncrossed, maintaining extended eye contact, and pointing one’s feet directly toward the person you’re interacting with.
Negative body language is marked by leaning or moving away, maintaining tense posture with legs and/or arms crossed stiffly, pointing feet away, and avoiding eye contact.
Note that some of those negative markers might be attributed to shyness. Just because a guy can’t keep eye contact with you doesn’t mean that he doesn’t want to.

, Nobody likes it when they’re trying to talk about something they care about, but their listener zones out on them. Listen to what he’s saying — both to make him feel like you care, and to learn more about him. After all, you have to decide whether or not he’s the right guy for you, too!


Though it’s important to listen, don’t fake being overly interested in something you don’t care about just because he’s talking about it. If you make him think that you care deeply about that subject, he’ll bore you to death with it.

, Just as you’re learning about him by listening to him talk about his interests, you want him to learn about you, so talk about your interests. Know that there are some subjects that are more appropriate for closer friends or for girl-friends — for example, don’t talk about your deepest, darkest secrets or your favorite makeup techniques with a boy you’re just trying to get to know.


Show off the traits you want him to know about you by directing conversation that way. If you’re a great athlete, talk about how practice is going this week. If you’re an actress, talk about rehearsals. If you love to read, talk about the book you’re reading right now.
But don’t monopolize the conversation by talking about yourself and your interests the whole time. This should be a give and take — both of you should do equal amounts of talking and listening.

Start with the proper staging.,
Think there is no ""the rest"", there is only ME.,
Make elongated eye contact with hot men.,
Dress to impress, but be modest.,
Don't engage in false advertising.,
Be confident.,
Don't be desperate.",How to Attract Men in Public," In a public place you can meet anyone. Try to pick places where you think that the kind of people you would want to meet would spend their time. A bar might be a nice place to meet someone but you are more likely to meet someone with a drinking problem if you meet someone there.;
, Don't worry about what other women are doing. Don't do what they are doing, don't look like them. He is not with them, so doing what they are doing, and looking like them won't help. What kind of person do you want him to want? Work on being that person.

, In any situation prolonged eye contact will give him the message that you have an interest in him. The bigger your smile is an indication to him how aggressive you want him to be. No smile at all and it may be several chance encounters before he says something to you. A big smile may send him running your way. If you are really interested in a particular guy, why play games? Maybe a nod is needed to give him the signal that he needs to come see you now. In a situation where there are lots of distractions you may need to approach him even if it's about something incidental. ""Pardon me, do you have the time?"" will get you noticed and will give him an opportunity to decide if he wants to meet you. ""Pardon me, I seem to have lost my earring, can you help me find it?"" Such a question will not only get you noticed but he will be hoping you never find your earring so that he will have an opportunity to chat with you. In a first meeting it's important to set his expectations. The more sexual your behavior, pursed pouty lips, he may be inclined to think of you only for one thing.

, Whatever your body type, age or shape, there is a style of clothing, color, hair do, whatever that will suit you best. Also don't let your body type, age or shape get in the way. Almost any woman can pretty much get almost any guy if you play your cards right. Don't dress in a manner that you would not dress once you're with him. This means: no greasy hair , well-fitting clothes that suggest a level of modesty that leaves much to the imagination and a faint scent of alluring perfume that will leave men wondering just what makes you smell so good.

, If you have to look too inviting to attract a guy, believe me, you don't want him. Don't overdo it with makeup, don't wear heels that are too high, don't wear a dress that's too tight. Don't cover it all up, but don't let it all hang out either. Go with your own hair as much as possible.

, Expect that most men that you meet will never get beyond being an acquaintance. Most men prefer the confident, happy women. So don't be afraid to make the first move, don't be afraid to engage a man in conversation. If a guy has to move a conversation forward, then he will think of you more as a potential conquest, instead of someone whom he should take seriously. Even if it doesn't work out, or nothing comes of meeting him, he may tell a guy friend, ""hey, I met this great girl, let me introduce you to her"".

, It is okay that people know that you are available. Guys like the women that they meet to be very friendly but discriminating. They want to know that it's okay to approach you and if you do invest time in getting to know them, you may see that they are special -- just like you.

Get to know her.,
Find things you have in common.,
Be a good friend.,
Don’t be a creeper.",How to Attract Girls1," Talk to her and listen to her. Ask her about her family and where she grew up, her religion and politics, and what she likes to do for fun. Don’t be critical or rude about her answers: they are hers, not yours! Respect her ideas, her opinions, and her beliefs. Girls like it when you treat them like people. If you want girls to find you attractive, respecting them as people is a great place to start.


For example, ask her about her favorite hobby, and then ask her how she got in to that hobby. This is a great way to work into talking about where and how she grew up, her family, etc.;
, She likes Metallica….you like Metallica…..bam! You now have something to talk about! Ask her about the music she listens to, the movies she watches, and the things she does in her spare time. Find some common ground and you will have a great way to get to know each other and bond.

, If we guaranteed you wouldn’t get friend-zoned, we’d be lying. But being friends with a girl and showing her what a wonderful person you are is the best way to attract her. Show her how happy she’d be with you and then see how much happier you are with her.


Be supportive when she is having a hard day, help take her mind off of her problems, be available when she needs help, and listen to her when she talks.

, Don’t stare at her and then avoid eye contact. Don’t hover around her and then never actually manage to say anything. Don’t stare at….certain parts of her anatomy (however tempting). Don’t make weird sexual advances if you don’t know her well and definitely don’t use pick up lines. Things like this will freak her out and definitely make you a lot less attractive.

Know if you're dating an entrepreneur.,
Become comfortable with risk.,
Be independent and ready to fill your own time.,
Understand the value of money and don't be a big spender.,
Be optimistic, positive and generally not prone to worry.,
Be flexible with time, expectations and plans.,
The dates that entrepreneurs adore are the ones who either offer to help, or are relieved to take care of some of their own work while they're busy.

If you are having trouble getting through to your sweetie that something is really important to you, try to give them a cost/benefit analysis of the situation.,
Ask for balance and expect it.,
Don't forget that this person cares about you.",How to Date an Entrepreneur," This is based on the typical entrepreneur. At times a newly successful business owner might shoot the curve by going bling or an old schooler may decide to take a break. But if you look carefully, these attitudes will still be there.



Careful about money. If you are planning to date a business owner, be prepared to be picked up in a practical and non-flashy car, go to dinner at places with good food but not over the top, eat in as much as you eat out (if not more) and live in a reasonably sized house in a good part of town (likely with fixer-upper projects needing completion). Any successful business owner keeps an eye on the bottom line and always calculates the cost analysis. Don’t be surprised if you get in a fight and s/he flings a number out at you about how much you have cost them (in terms of money earning time or actual $$).

Careful about time. Entrepreneurs tend to get up early and stay up late. You’ll likely see a comfy couch in their office — short naps are the backbone of most of the successfully self-employed. They squeeze in emails, calls and deals in between bites of dinner and trips to the bathroom. If they see it as a “waste of time,” they’ll be grumpy if not allowed to cut free and move onto something deemed productive. It can become a balance issue, and likely ends most relationships before they ever get off the ground. But if you can talk to your entrepreneur and strike a bargain, you’ll come out a winner on all fronts. (See the section on communication below.)

Competitive risk takers. Your honey will seem (to you) to be blasé, or unimpressed, about risk. They aren’t. The risks are always calculated and analyzed (for the successful entrepreneur) but for someone who isn’t used to free falling, it can be scary. They are also extremely competitive. Family game time can get a bit hairy and most will use the rare free time competing in their favorite venue, be it sports, gaming, gambling, whatever.
Loners. You might have a hard time getting your honey out of the house once they get home for time to relax. Some do a good job putting on a social face, especially if it means networking, but know that your entrepreneur will not be someone who follows the pack. If the rest of the world thinks one way, your honey will likely think exactly the opposite or between the lines or even off into the future to see some eventual possibility most could never imagine.

Business minded to the point of scanning every environment you are in for business ideas or drifting off after you tell them something random and swimming back into the conversation after turning your random comment into a business application. They are also problem solvers in the extreme and will simply not understand you wanting to talk through something without coming to a solution. If you need them to stop problem solving for you, be direct and tell them so. It may take some getting used to, but when they begin to see that you solve your own problems in your own time frame, they will generally lay off and let you do your own thing.
Tend to be honest and direct. Many are people that are trusted with handshake deals. If your entrepreneur is at all community minded, you’ll find them attracting and collecting people a lot like them.;
, If you are risk-averse, you’re going to either have to get over it or learn how to support someone who lives and breathes risk. After all, it's part of their genius and if an entrepreneur was afraid to take risks, they wouldn’t be able to start and grow a successful business. Being more Zen about the ups and downs of life will help you more than just about anything in living with an entrepreneur.

, If you need to be the center of your honey’s attention, you may really struggle with what will seem to you to be an inordinate amount of time spent at the computer/office/in meetings/on the phone.


How to Stop Being Needy
How to Avoid Being an Obsessive Girlfriend

, You will be the apple of an entrepreneur’s eye! By not expecting them to spend money on the “frivolous,” you will be head and shoulders above the pack in their estimation.

, Bingo. You’re the entrepreneur’s version of a rock star.

, You guessed it; most entrepreneurs don’t know the meaning of “weekend,” “evening,” or “vacation.” Here are some examples:


You might be shocked to find that your entrepreneurial love interest expects to continue working - via phone - even on their honeymoon and the entrepreneur will be surprised if you get upset about it.
A vacation with an entrepreneur might involve negotiating phone and laptop time.
Many entrepreneurs will ask a date if they are ok with them taking care of “this little bit of business” in between dinner and later plans.

,, You can recognize this state of being by the one word answers, slightly clipped replies, distracted mentality and maybe a little irritability if you interrupt a stream of thought or creativity. When they are ""off the clock"" on the other hand, this is likely the person you fell for. Many entrepreneurs have a great sense of humor, intellect and creativity. Some also have natural charisma and charm when they have the time to just relax with loved ones. When an entrepreneur sets his or her eyes on someone they want to get to know better, you become their latest goal and all that talent, charm, sales-ability and intellect that usually goes toward getting more business will come your way.

, Be direct, practical, non-fluffy and ask for minimal input on issues outside of the practical or easily taken care of situations. By thinking of the bottom line and then approaching all communication at that level, you can bypass some of the irritation via interruption.


For example, instead of, “You remember that guy we talked to at the party a few weeks ago — the friend of yours who owns a Mustang. You know, the party where you had that one wine you really enjoyed? Okay, so what was the name of the plumber that he mentioned really liking? If you have the time today, it would be great if you could get that information and contact the plumber about fixing the toilet for us. Can you do that? I’ll be home most of the afternoons this week and it would be easy for me to wait for him here.”
Try something more along the lines of “Will you please schedule that plumber that your friend Joe recommended to come fix the toilet between 2-5 any day this week?”

, It may seem harsh to you, but to your entrepreneur, it will seem natural and best of all — will make sense to them!


Another example: Instead of “I can’t believe you are on that damn CrackBerry all the time! You don’t love me! If you did you wouldn’t spend so much time working when we are supposed to be out! You don’t even talk to me. If you don’t get it together and treat me with at least as much attention as one of your stupid business deals, I’m leaving!!”
Try this instead: “I’ve noticed a communication and time breakdown in how we are investing in our relationship and wanted to know if you’ve noticed the same thing. (Insert a few concrete examples if your honey likes backup information) Since I care about you very much, I want to make sure we are both meeting each other's needs so our relationship can continue to grow and expand. I need _______ in order to continue growing this relationship and am wondering if you are able to meet that need or would you prefer to be with someone who doesn’t need you to meet that need?” It's a simple and direct problem analysis. One that s/he could easily hear in a boardroom or client meeting.
For more guidance, see How to Practice Nonviolent Communication.

, Realistically, this will be the largest hurdle for most newbie entrepreneurs. The old schoolers understand that you need balance or you will burn out, but the new ones think that they can just keep going at that rate and life as they want it will be waiting for them when they are done. If you love this person or are trying to make something work with them, approach it like the above outlined business proposal and explain what you need in terms of ROI (or return on interest/investment).

, Yes, many entrepreneurs are lost in their business, kind of like a new mom with her baby, but that doesn’t mean they don’t care about you or have lost the qualities that first attracted you. Remember that, for them, time is probably their largest sacrifice. If they are giving that to you, it should tell you quite a bit about where you are on the priority scale.

Find your talents.,
Be exciting.,
Be kind and respectful to everybody.,
Be stable.,
Be her knight in shining armor.,
Don't be a jerk.",How to Attract Women Without Doing Anything2," Everybody is attracted to people who can do cool things. Now, you probably already have a talent or the potential for a talent that you don't know about. You need to find that talent and feed it. Even if it isn't a classically attractive talent like playing an instrument, nurturing your talent and spending time with people who do the same thing will give you the opportunity to meet girls who enjoy the same things you do.


You can always learn a new talent too. Drawing is a good one, since it is a skill that can be learned, rather than something that really requires innate talent.

, Don't be the guy who sits at home all weekend, eating Funyuns and playing COD. There's nothing wrong with being introverted, but you still need to spend your time doing exciting things. If you're introverted, start writing a book or teaching yourself an art. If you're more comfortable talking to people and getting outside, go do those things. Join a club, go hiking, volunteer, whatever. Just make your life about something. You want to have something to talk to girls about, don't you?


If you're going to insist on playing COD, you better plan on becoming a championship winning competitive player because that's basically what it's going to take.

, While you're probably not walking around, if you have a bad attitude and you treat other people poorly, you are going to have a hard time attracting women. Even if you're nice to women you want to date but a total jerk to everyone else, women will notice. Be nice, legitimately nice, and respectful towards everyone and women will be reasonably assured that they can always expect the same.

, Be stable by having a good job, doing the things you say that you will, and generally being responsible. Don't think that women want you to have an awesome job so that they'll be taken care of; they just want to know that you won't be a dead weight! Just like you might not want to have to support a girl who does nothing, women don't want a guy who sits around all day eating Cheetos. If you show her that you can pay your bills and hold down a good job, she'll be much more likely to want to date you.

, Being her knight in armor isn't about treating her like she can't do things for herself. It's about giving her the tools she needs to rescue herself. Be emotionally supportive when she's had a bad day. Help her talk through her problems so that she can find a solution. When she asks you for help or advice, give it, without judgement or criticism. Find ways that you can make her life easier and help her achieve the things she wants for her life.

, You could be Jon Hamm, it doesn't matter: women are not obligated to want to date you. Remember that. Just think, if some girl you found unattractive and boring started shouting about how you were a loser or something, how would you feel? Sometimes people just don't connect. That's not your fault and it's not her fault either. Just keep trying and you'll find Ms. Perfect.

Do your own thing.,
Give girls their freedom.,
Don't be a follower.,
Don't be creepy.,
Okay, don't be too independent.",How to Attract Women Without Doing Anything3," If you don't want to go out and actively get girls, you're going to have to be sure you're going off to do your own thing. Don't hang around waiting for them or send them flowers every week. Just go do your own thing and wait for them to come to you. Some things you can do are:


Hang with your friends. Gotta get in that COD time, after all.
Hang out alone. At last! Peace and quiet! Underwear rock out party time!
Do things you enjoy. This is a great time to develop those skills that girls find so attractive.

, Girls don't want to date someone who's really clingy or controlling. If you have girl friends that you're hoping to catch the eye of, show them that you're perfectly happy to go do your own thing without them. Don't annoy them by constantly asking to hang out, don't ask to go everywhere with them (or follow them around without asking!), don't try to trap them in a corner when you want to talk, and don't try to guilt them or manipulate them into going places with you. Show girls that they are free to go where they want and do what they want, and if they want a buddy along for the ride, you're there for them.

, Start trends, don't follow them. Girls are attracted to guys they perceive as cool. Try to be independent and show your own personality, rather than copying what the other guys are doing.

, This is very important for getting girls to want to date you. Avoid awkward comments or jokes. Keep your eyes on her face. Don't stalk girls. If a few girls decide that you are a creeper, they will probably warn other girls that you are a creeper and then you're just doomed.


A good rule of thumb is that if you wouldn't say something to your mom, don't say it to a girl you're not dating.

, You shouldn't leave girls thinking you're uninterested in dating altogether. Flirt occasionally or find other ways to show that you're interested.

Build your self esteem and confidence.,
Don’t compare yourself to others.,
Take care of yourself and your appearance.,
Be approachable.,
Be an amazing person.,
Be kind and funny.,
Keep up in school.,
Join sports.",How to Attract Girls2," Self confidence and self esteem are very attractive qualities. Girls will fall head over heels for a guy that is confident in himself and what he can do. Do things that build your confidence in yourself like volunteering, learning a new skill, or traveling.


You can build confidence by volunteering with an organization like Homes for Humanity. This will give you the chance to prove to yourself and everyone else that you can do something and make a difference.
You can also boost your confidence by learning a new skill, like a second or third language. This can be done easily and for free online with sites like Livemocha.

, This is not going to make you feel any better about yourself. The only person you can ever be is you and that is great! Show the world how awesome you can be and stop trying to be somebody else’s brand of awesome.


Don’t try to act like anyone other than yourself either. Girls will notice you trying to hard and being all fake and they will not find that attractive. Acting like some gangsta thug when you grew up rich in the suburbs? Sorry, poser. She’ll notice. Just be you and be happy about being you. Girls will find that very attractive.

, Don’t neglect personal hygiene or your wardrobe. Why would a girl like you if you didn’t even like yourself enough to take care of your body? Wash your hair and body regularly, use deodorant, wear clothes that don’t have holes or stains, and brush your teeth.


Don't worry too much about wearing brand name clothes. She'll notice a lot more if your clothes fit you well and are in colors that make you look great, not what letter is written on the chest.
Don't go overboard, of course. Some gel in your hair is probably good, but it shouldn't look wet and be rock hard, you know?

, Don’t seem angry, upset, douchey or otherwise unpleasant to talk to. If you seem like you’re mad at her every time you talk to her, why would she want to talk to you, much less date you? Smile, be friendly, and try to make yourself easy to talk to by, you know, talking.

, Be someone that girls want to date. You don’t have to be smart but at least try to be knowledgeable and curious. Be a kind person that works hard to improve the lives of people around you. And do something with your life. That part is really important. Get out there and work to make a better life for yourself.


You can become more knowledgeable by reading about things that interest you. Did you know they have entire books about the evolution of weapons like swords? Books about how they think dinosaurs killed their prey? Yeah, library time.
Consider your dreams. What do you want for your life? What is your great passion? Showing that passion is really attractive to girls: they want to think that you'll love them as much as you love...baseball or whatever.

, Try to help her and always smile at her. A smile can make her day much better. Don't try to act cool and don't always talk to your friends when she's around. Try to set some time alone with her and talk to her in a kind voice.

, You don't have to get perfect grades, but at least shoot for ""A""s and ""B""s. Get good grades, but don't become arrogant either. Offer to help her with assignments she is having trouble with or offer to help her study for a test. Don't take it personally if she says she doesn't want your help though.


Staying organized is also very important. You don't want to look like a mess in class all the time trying to find your homework in front of her. Most girls like organized boys that turn in their assignments on time.

, This can not only attract many girls, especially cheerleaders and other girls that also play sports, but also boost your self-confidence. Girls like boys who are in shape and are athletic. Tryout for sports and get on a team with people that go to your school.

Take a dance class.
Sample exotic cuisine.
Go to museums and learn about art.

, When you’re talking to a girl, look her in the eye so that she knows that she has your attention. Girls hate when men can’t concentrate on them long enough to build a connection.Don’t try to split your attention. You can’t talk to her and watch the game at the same time. Choose one or the other.
Be sure to look away every once in awhile so you don’t make her feel uncomfortable.
Don’t stare at other girls when you’re with her.

, Don’t ramble on and on about yourself. Show interest in what she has to say. Everyone loves to talk and there’s nothing more annoying than a guy who hijacks a conversation.

, Girls put in a lot of effort to look good and they want their hard work to be acknowledged. Compliment specific things you like about her outfit. Let her know that you dig her fashion sense.Tell her you like her new hairstyle.
Compliment her make up.
Let her know you like how her shoes go with her dress.
Tell her you think her perfume is intoxicating.

, You can’t give a girl your full attention if your mind is somewhere else. She’ll be able to tell if you’re not present. Try not to focus on the other things going on in your life when you’re around a girl you like.


Take a few minutes to meditate to clear your mind before you talk to a girl.
Realize that worry doesn’t accomplish anything. Focus on having a good time.

, Girls are annoyed by guys who talk down to them. Don’t make comments that could be considered derogatory towards women or anyone else for that matter. If she feels like you objectify women, she definitely won’t want to spend time with you.


Don’t tell any jokes that could be construed as sexist or racist.

, Don’t talk about your ex all the time. Girls hate when you can’t stop babbling about your past relationships. She’ll think you still have feelings for your ex. No woman wants to be your rebound girlfriend.


At some point, she may want to know about your former relationships to see what kind of guy you are, but let the conversation come up naturally.
If you are still hung up on your ex, you should take some time to recover before you try meeting new women.

, Don’t be possessive. Girls get really annoyed when you act like they’re your property. She’ll also feel like you’re insecure if you feel the need to demonstrate ownership of her everywhere the two of you go. Girls don’t like being treated like trophies.Abstain from public displays of affection to show other guys she’s with you.
Don’t try to stop her from talking to other guys.

, Always be polite and avoid being crass. Try not to say or do anything that she could be offended by. If you gross her out, she certainly won’t be attracted to you and she may even be embarrassed to be around you in public.


Hold the door open for her.
Don’t curse or swear.
Be kind to service staff.

, Smile to let her know that you’re having a good time. Make sure your smile is genuine. She’ll be able to tell if you’re faking it. A smile is an international sign that we like the person we’re talking to.

, Girls don’t like being hit on by guys who smell like the inside of a keg. While a few drinks may help you loosen up, too many will make you look sloppy. If you’re slurring your words and stumbling all over the place, she’ll know you’re too drunk to focus on her.

, Don’t invade her space by trying to touch her before you build a connection with her. She’ll think you’re sleazy and only after one thing. Get to know her and let things develop naturally. Let her know you respect her boundaries.


Don’t kiss a girl on the cheek when you first meet her. Try shaking her hand.

, Be direct and tell her that you really enjoy hanging out with her. Be sure she knows you like her for her personality. Keep your eyes on her face while you’re telling her you like her and try not to check out her body in an obvious way.Refrain from using sexual innuendos.
Don’t be overly sexual or treat her like a piece of meat.

, After you have a connection with a girl, politely ask for her number. By asking for her number, you’re showing her that you’d like to talk to her again and giving her a chance to do the same by giving it to you.


Don’t give her your number or she’ll think you’re afraid to put yourself out there.
Don’t be pushy. If she doesn’t want to give you her number, move on. She’ll find you annoying if you try to force her to give it to you."

Start with nice friends.,
Avoid the places you're looking now.,
Try charity events.,
Try your work.,
Try church.,
Try asking friends.,
Respect yourself.,
Be confident.,
Take initiative.,
Take things slow.,
Be yourself.,
Get your priorities straight.,
Set the bar high.,
Ask about his mom.,
Notice how he treats others.,
Notice how he talks to you.",How to Attract Good Men," Surrounding yourself with quality people is a good start towards finding a great guy. Don't tolerate any of the bad behavior in your friend group that you wouldn't want to see in a significant other. This makes you more likely to turn a friendship into a good relationship, or to meet good people that are friends with other good (and totally single) guys.;
, If you're using a combination of bars and Craigslist, that's your main problem. Stop. Most of the ""usual"" places are where you're likely to find the most losers. Also: weddings, clubs, parties, the gym, etc. All those places where guys know you'll be looking for love. If you stick to the usual spots, you'll be more likely to meet guys looking to take advantage of you.

, Guys are much less likely to be looking to meet someone at charity events but such places are highly likely to attract guys with their priorities in the right place. Surprise a guy by sweeping him off his feet when he least expects it.

, A good portion of coupes meet at work. This is another place where guys will not come to prey, so you're know that you're probably safe. It's also a lot easier to gauge who's single!

, Well, of course, any place of worship will do. Exercise your spiritual side and invite the opportunity to meet a guy with his heart in the right place and with similar morals and ideas to you.


If you're not the bible-thumping type, there are lots of churches with more laid-back attitudes that focus on inspiration and practical moral guidance.

, It seems silly, but just ask your friends for help. Ask them to set you up. Your social circle may have been milked dry, but all your friends know more people than just you. You may be surprised by what they can come up with.

, This is the most important part of finding a good guy. You HAVE to respect yourself. You have to believe that you deserve a good guy (and you do, so that shouldn't be too hard). Stop beating yourself up. Stop allowing people to walk all over you. Stand up for yourself and do the things that make you happy. And stop apologizing for wanting things.


This means dressing nicely as well. You should dress like you want to be respected and taken seriously. Don't wear anything too tight or revealing. Wear something that would be good for going out to a nice lunch or dinner with your parents. At work, dress like you intend to be the next manager.

, Bad guys are looking for those that doubt themselves. That think they aren't worth as much because they're ""fat"" or ""ugly"" or ""poor"". Don't ever let anyone think you see yourself as less. Be confident. Speak your mind. Don't apologize. Avoid seeming shy. It doesn't have to be real, of course: for most people it's just an act.

, Don't wait for Prince Charming to come to you. Get out there and find him. Ask guys out on dates. The nice ones, the actually nice ones, tend to be shy or inexperienced and may need a little help getting started.


Try, for example, ""If you ask me to go with you to that new art exhibit opening this weekend, I wouldn't say no.""

, Being too quick to jump into bed with a guy tends to tell them that you're desperate and they don't have to try as hard. Make them realize that you, like them, are worth putting in some effort for.

, Pretending to be what you think guys want is just going to attract guys that are looking for all the wrong things. If you just get out there and be yourself, you'll attract a guy that's looking for you.

, If you're putting an emphasis on guys that look super hot instead of guys that work hard and treat you right, you're going to have a rough time. Make sure you recognize what's really important and you'll be finding great guys before you know it., Guys will live up to the standards you set for them. If you don't tolerate poor behavior and disrespect, then you won't see any more of it. If a guy does something that upsets you, say so. If he's being a jerk, stand up for yourself.

, Or, really, any of the women in his life. Get him to talk about them. If he clearly loves and respects them, that's a good sign.

, If he's nice to other people, that's also a good sign of what you can expect towards you. Especially pay attention to how he treats people who are ""beneath"" him (like waiters, homeless people, door-to-door folks, and kids). If he's nice to the sort of people that people are usually mean to, you're in good shape.

, Does he ask about your career? Does he use terms like ""you"" and ""we"" more than terms like ""I "" and ""me""? Does he talk in a future tense about your relationship? These are good signs. Look for language that shows that he cares about you and values your relationship."

Act mature.,
Avoid pointing out the age gap.,
Don't play games.,
Treat him with respect.,

Introduce him into your social circle.",How to Attract an Older Guy," Looking more mature doesn't mean you need to look old. In fact, your youth is probably one of your most attractive qualities. Rather, it means picking a hairstyle that suits you rather than something wild, and switching out some of your less mature clothing for a more sophisticated look. Basically, you want to be well put together to attract an older guy., Nothing is as attractive as confidence. That means paying attention to your posture (sit up straight!). It also means looking him in the eye while you're talking to him. Try to keep yourself calm and collected, so your words come out strong and sure, not fast and jumbled.Also, don't forget to smile. A smile lights up your face and shows you're enjoying yourself., Many old guys will be turned off if you are just looking for someone to take care of you. In other words, have a steady job and a well-established house or apartment. If an older guy is looking at you, those qualities will show him your mature enough to date him., You may think it's best to spill you're whole life story on the first date. Really, though, that shows a lack of maturity. Keep some things back for later in your dating life., That is, be on good terms with your family. By being on good terms, you've shown that you can maintain long-term relationships, even when things may get a little tough., Depending on how old the guy is, he may have completely different social habits than you. If you're in your 20s, and you're after a guy in his 30s, he may not be as interested in going out drinking as you are.You don't have to change who you are to attract an older guy, but you should make sure the two of you are a good fit. An older guy is likely to be more set in his ways, but that doesn't mean you have to follow suit. You can still go out with your friends, but don't leave a string of drunken messages on his phone., Getting over the age gap may be one of the harder aspects of dating an older guy. Avoid making references about his age, and if you bring your friends around, make sure they do the same.An age gap between partners can make it harder to connect. He probably has different hobbies, and different tastes, than you do. Try to connect with him on these things. Listen to music he likes, but also try to expose him to things you like. Don't force him to behave like a younger man, but try to involve him in your hobbies and interests., It doesn't matter how old someone is, nobody likes manipulation. Don't try to make an older man jealous to get his attention, and don't play head games to make him want you.One reason an older man might hesitate to date a younger woman is the fear of being toyed with. Approach an older guy with confidence and be direct. If you like him, say so.Don't assume that because a man is older, he's mature and ready to settle down. Some older men may want to take advantage of younger women to make themselves feel younger. Just as you don't want to play games with an older man, don't let an older man play games with you., Don't go after an older man because you want his money. He may be successful, and he may spoil you with the occasional nice date, but that doesn't mean he's going to give you all his money.Don't ask him how much money he makes, or what kind of car he drives. If he gets the feeling that you're only with him for his money, he's likely to end things. If you don't actually like the guy, don't lead him on., Before you get into a relationship with an older guy, find out what his goals are. Does he have any long-term plans? It's important to know how you will fit into each other's life.If he already has kids, for example, he may not be interested in starting a whole new family with you. If you don't want kids, this may be fine with you. But, if you do want kids, this could mean trouble down the road.Don't sacrifice your own goals to be with someone who is already starting to settle down. Or, if his plans are to start traveling the world, and you're still finishing up college, don't drop everything just to be with him., Intimacy is a big part of any relationship. Don't base your entire relationship on sexual compatibility, but take it into consideration.Don't assume that an older man will be less sexually active. The opposite is more likely to be true. An older man has probably had more sexual partners, and is likely to have more experience in the bedroom., More than anything, make sure you can get along with each other. Learn from each other and delight in sharing new experiences with one another.Take some time to assess your compatibility. Find out if you have any overlapping hobbies and pursue those. Find ways to spend time doing things you both enjoy., One big hurdle of dating an older guy is wondering how he will fit in with the rest of your friends. Think about the type of people you regularly hang out with. How will they react to you dating an older man?Your friends shouldn't dictate who you date, especially if you care for the person. However, you should consider how your partner will get along with your friends. Likewise, think about who he hangs out with, and how you feel about his friends.Talk with each other about your respective social circles. Make sure your partner is comfortable with your friends, and vice versa.

Portray the qualities you seek in a man.,
Carry yourself with confidence.,
Invest in yourself.,
Be yourself.",How to Attract Better Men1," If you want a happy-go-lucky, physically fit, educated man, you should work on being a happy-go-lucky, physically fit, educated woman. You need to become the type of person you want to attract, first and foremost. Birds of a feather flock together, so be the kind of person you want to flock with!Not only will this attract the right kind of men, but working on yourself will also increase your self-confidence.
A good rule of thumb is to sporadically “check yourself,” and decide if you would want a man who is doing what you’re doing. In other words, if you’re lying on the couch eating Twinkies and feeling sorry for yourself, decide if you want a man lying on his couch doing the same thing. You’d probably rather have a man who is out, doing something he loves, and feeling great.;
, If you act like you deserve a great man, you will attract great men. This does not mean that you should turn up your nose at every man who you deem unworthy, but rather be picky about who you accept on a romantic level. Be kind, and carry yourself with self-assurance and poise. If you don’t act like you deserve a better man, you probably won’t get one.If you carry yourself like the prize that you are, you will be seen as a prize. The best kind of men will be willing to work for you., Take care of yourself, practice self-love daily, and pamper yourself when you have no one else doing it for you. By taking care of yourself, you’re ensuring that you feel great. When you feel great, you’ll ooze a self-confidence and love that is irresistible to good men. If you are investing in yourself, you’ll attract men that want to invest in you as well., Imagine falling in love with a man, only to find out a couple months later that he is not the man he pretended to be. It’s not fun, is it? When you want to attract an authentic man, you need to be authentic yourself. Don’t pretend to be a person that you aren’t, because you won’t be able to keep it up forever.By showing your true colors you’ll also immediately weed out the men who wouldn’t be interested in the real, genuine you. If you love to tell cheesy jokes and order two desserts, you might as well do it on the first date!

"
Do most of the talking in the very beginning.,
Avoid mundane subjects like work, politics, or anything negative.,
Move past obstacles with grace.,
Be outcome-independent.,
Don’t be needy.,
Implement what is called ""Reverse cold reading to bait qualification,"" or RCR.,
Be laid back and nonchalant about the whole thing.,
Remember that picking up girls is largely about time management.,
Lastly, constantly assess her attraction.",How to Attract a Woman," This, of course, depends on the woman and the situation, but you want to avoid doing what most guys do, which is to put the conversational burden on her with redundant questions and digging for commonalities. Shoot to do about 75% of the talking, maybe a bit less. Your aim here is to demonstrate your fantastic personality and high value. Try to keep the conversation light, fun, and playful. What conversation starters might you use? There are plenty:


The cocky, playful alpha guy:

""I know you probably get this a lot, but you're absolutely the most stunning woman I've seen...in the last three minutes.""
""My friend had to drag me out tonight, but I'm finally glad he did, because seeing you, right here, right now, was worth it.""


The slightly shy, bashful guy:

""I'm sorry this is awkward, but I get really shy around pretty girls.""
""I'm glad you're still here. I've been working up the courage to talk to you for half an hour, and I was worried I was going to have to embarrass myself in front of you totally sober.""


The up-front, matter-of-fact guy:

""Hi, my name is , what brings you here tonight?""
""This is the part where I introduce myself and you smile and let me buy you a drink, is that right?""
""I've been trying to think of an excuse to talk to you, but I got nothing. Can I just tell you an interesting story that happened to me the other day?""

;
, Be in control of the conversation, but don’t be controlling. Don’t let yourself slip into interview type questions, like ""Where are you from?"" or ""What are you doing here?"" Try to tap into your slightly dangerous, but still controlled, side, and feed off that energy.


If she brings up subjects that you think might steer the conversation down the wrong path, gently push the conversation in another direction. Saying something that has something to do with the topic, but is funny, light, and might bring a change of topic.
If she keeps coming back to the subjects you think are leading the conversation astray, you have two options:

Feed off of the energy of that topic, since she seems to want to talk about it.
Find an elegant, respectful way to leave the conversation, and instead focus on someone else. A simple ""It was nice talking to you"" should do the trick.



, Many women will say they have a boyfriend if they don’t have enough attraction for you yet. At the same time, many women who say they have a boyfriend actually have one, so you've reached an obstacle. Don't fret, though, because an obstacle is made to be overcome. You'll move past it with grace.


If a woman says ""I have a boyfriend, I'd prefer it if you didn't talk to me,"" just smile, tell her it was nice talking to her, and move on to another candidate. Sometimes life gives you bad lemons.
If a woman says ""I have a boyfriend,"" and leaves it at that, you can say: ""That's fine, I respect that. Do you mind if we keep chatting?"" If she says yes, keep on working. You're making lemonade out of lemons.
Don't assume that you'll be able to convince a woman in a relationship or marriage to part with her number. Maybe you don't even want to be that guy. If a girl mentions her boyfriend, you probably want to start looking elsewhere unless your dying wish is to get her number.

, Prime yourself not to care whether you get her attraction or not. If she's attracted to you, that's a bonus; if not, you'll move on to another interesting girl.


If you tell yourself that you need her attraction because your ego can't take rejection, you'll be sorely hurt, over and over again, because you will be rejected at some point. Rejection is natural. If you're so hurt or disappointed because you missed a single opportunity, you'll miss out on the thousands of other opportunities that await you.

, If the woman thinks, even for a moment, that she has more value in your eyes than you have in hers, you’re putting yourself at a disadvantage. Why? Because people want to have to work a little for their prize, because that makes the prize taste even sweeter.


There are many techniques you can use to demonstrate that you're not needy, but for now the best thing you can do is detach from outcome (see above). Remember: this woman, though she may be beautiful and funny and smart, is only one of a handful of beautiful, funny, and smart in your universe. If she doesn't work out, another one eventually will.
Don't shower her with compliments. A single choice compliment to start the conversation is all the woman needs to let her know that you're into her. Actually, because women are smart, they usually know if you're into them even without a compliment. So keep the schmaltzy compliments in your back pocket and focus on impressing her with your smarts, your humor, and your perspective.

, How it works: find something about her that you're fairly certain is not true. Then, say you don't like that quality in a girl. Because it's not true about her, she will then explain herself to you and let you know that she is not that way. This is called qualifying, and we do it when we're trying to win the favor of someone. What you're doing here is baiting her qualification; unconsciously she should become more attracted to you, because you ostensibly share similarities, or at least similar perspectives.

, Your number one priority should be to have fun, because once you remove (or try to remove) your own ego from the equation, talking with a beautiful, interesting woman is incredibly exhilarating. Flirt, tease, be slightly cocky if that's your persona, and use sarcasm (with a wry smile thrown in so she knows you’re just messing around). Pretend you’re speaking to an old friend.


If she says something that you disagree with, tell her. In other words, don't be milquetoast. When you disagree, don’t be mean, don’t be offensive; just rationalize your opinion and lay out why you feel the way you do. If you do this in the right way, it'll move the conversation forward and give you something interesting to talk about. If you're confident, you can tease her about how she’s not cool if she doesn’t agree with you (wry smile here folks, wry smile).
Be composed. Very, very composed. Like the captain, you know exactly where you want to go and everything you say and do has a purpose. Nothing can phase you, even rejection. You expect the best but are prepared for the worst. Why? Because you're more composed than a Keats poem!

, Why waste your time with conversation that isn’t pushing you closer to your goal? Besides, distractions may arise that will steal her attention, so each minute counts. With a little practice, it's easy to get numbers in seconds rather than minutes.


You may it's helpful to only talk for a few minutes before asking for a number, a dance, etc. That's because it's hard to keep up witty, direct, spirited conversation for a long time, even when you're hitting all cylinders. Don't string the conversation along without an end-goal in mind!

, Look for open body language, dilated pupils, giggling, and touching. Regardless of her personality or culture, women are pretty consistent with signs of attraction. With just a little practice you’ll be able to pick up on these signs very quickly. Just follow your hunch; it’s usually correct.

Decide your dating “non-negotiables,” and don’t waver.,
Make yourself available to the best kinds of men.,
Create your own independent, fulfilling life.",How to Attract Better Men2," When you’ve dated duds in the past, you probably found yourself compromising for what you’d accept from them. At first, it seems perfectly fine to overlook certain things they lacked, or make excuses for lackluster behavior. Stop doing this! If you want a better man, stop making excuses for them. Understand and remember what you really, truly, deeply want, and don’t accept less.


Note that this doesn’t mean you should reject any man who isn’t a billionaire with a supermodel face and an 8 pack. It means that you have every right to hold out for a man with a stable job, an active lifestyle, a generous spirit, and a sense of humor.
It’s OK to be picky. There are millions of men in this world, and you can and will find someone who has everything you’re looking for, if they are realistic expectations.

, If you want a man who spends his time volunteering, you need to get involved with volunteering. If you really want a guy who shares your faith, you need to be attending religious or spiritual events.While falling in love can feel like magic, use logic to set yourself up to find it. Increase your odds of finding a great man by spending time where they do.

, If you are happily single and satisfied, you don’t need a man to complete you. When you don’t need a man, you won’t settle for just any man who comes along. By staying busy and following your own passions, you’ll naturally up your standards. You’ll only accept a man into your life that will add to it, not fill some sort of void.Don’t be so fiercely independent that you refuse to open yourself up to love. It’s important that you can be content and satisfied on your own, but be careful not to completely block yourself off from receiving love.

Learn from your past relationships.,
Listen to your gut.,
Ditch anyone who doesn’t respect your boundaries.",How to Attract Better Men3," If you want to attract better men, you can’t repeat the mistakes of your past relationships. Instead of mourning over the time you wasted on less amazing men, take a lesson from it. If you want a different type of man, you have to seek out a different type of man.


If you never had good luck meeting good men at bars, stop trying to meet men at bars. If you’ve all of your past failed relationships are with bad boys, don’t date bad boys.

, When your intuition says to run, don’t ignore it. When you meet the right man, you shouldn’t feel troubled or apprehensive. Don’t ignore your instinct. Every day that you waste with the wrong man is a day that you miss out meeting a better one. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and walk away., This is a no-brainer and is absolutely non-negotiable. Good men will never, under any circumstance, pressure you into doing something. In fact, the best kind of men will admire the fact that you know your own boundaries and self-worth and will speak up when you don’t feel right about something.If you find yourself having to repeatedly say “no,” he is not the kind of man you want. Move along, and find yourself a better man!

Girls of this type are usually shy, quiet or easily intimidated.,
Once you two are on good terms, you know you have a chance.,
Be sure to keep an eye on her so that if she needs to be rescued, you're there.,
If she ever cries in front of you, comfort her.,
Don't be afraid to be romantic.,
Give her a single red rose on her birthday.,
If you ask her out, ask her in person.,
Progress with her slowly, even if it means holding back.,
Never, ever, do anything that will hurt her, mentally or physically.,
If she does something for you, remember that she most likely put her entire being into it.,
Never force her to do something.",How to Attract a Hopelessly Romantic Girl," When you first approach her personally, you must be sure to do it in a way that won't scare her. (Which also means respecting the touch barrier even more than usual.) An excellent way of finding excuses to talk to a hopeless romantic girl is to help her if she drops something, offer to help if she's carrying something heavy, etc. A girl like this likes to be ""saved"". Perform these little tasks as often as you can until she seems comfortable around you, then talk to her when you can. Be sure to always look her in the eyes, and never anywhere else.;
, If she twirls her hair, blushes, glances at you a lot or holds her arms close to her body then you know she's shy around you—which could often mean she likes you and is embarrassed. Be sure to talk gently to her and never do anything which might scare or offend her.

, Although this is definitely not a carte blanche to stalk her (not only a good way to scare her off, but illegal in many parts of the world), you should be around when she needs you. If you see a person or group scaring her for whatever reason, do not be afraid to go over and stand up for her. If she is in a threatening situation, do not be afraid to stand in front of her protectively. Even if she simply falls and everyone laughs at her, be sure to ask if she's okay and help her up. All of these will make you seem the better man, and she will remember what you did. (But if she's being threatened and she sees you ignore her, she'll remember that too.)

, There is nothing more calming to a romantic girl than when a male holds her and reassures her that everything will be okay. Be sure to hold her in that way that makes her feel protected and safe. If she continues to cry, rock her gently or stroke her hair.

, This is the most important thing. Hopeless romantic girls are heavily influenced by romance novels, films, poetry, etc. and therefore have high expectations. Even if your friends or peers say things which might make you embarrassed, ignore them.

, Nothing is more romantic than this clichéd gift, and be sure to accompany it with your most sincere feelings, preferably in words. If you are unable to find a red rose, or are unsure of whether she likes roses, then buy her a bunch of flowers. No girl can deny that she enjoys receiving flowers.


Note — This presupposes that you know when her birthday is, so only do this if you've already established some sort of friendship.

, Nothing is more repelling to a girl like this than a guy who can't manage to confess to her face. It will make her think that you are unable to protect her or look after her as you do not have the courage. It will also help if you ask her in a very romantic situation, as it will be harder for her to deny you. For example, call her to meet you at sunset in a beautiful and secluded area, or ask her whilst the two of you are alone stargazing. A midnight walk along the beach is perfect, too.

, These girls are more sensitive than most, so going too quickly will scare them away. If she seems uncomfortable with something, don't do it again until you are sure that she won't mind.

, If you do by accident, be sure to apologise with a few soft words and her favourite flower. If, however, you do on purpose, then she will leave. You're supposed to protect her, not hurt her.

, Even if it's just home-made chocolates on Valentine's day or a poem she wrote for you. Even if it doesn't taste, sound or look nice. Keep in mind that she tried her best to please you and thank her sincerely for it, so that she knows that you appreciate her efforts.

, If she still isn't ready for something or doesn't want to go somewhere, don't lose patience and force her. It will damage her feelings about you—more importantly, it will damage her. Wait until she is ready—it will be worth it. This doesn't mean that you can never try, but if she clearly isn't happy then stop. What's more important—your happiness, or hers?

Think about what you want.,
Start paying attention to the way guys behave.,

Be the person you want.,
Act with kindness.,
Exude a positive attitude.,
Reveal your quirky interests.,
Go to interesting places.,
Go out in small groups.,
Use your body language.,
Show your interest.",How to Attract a Guy Who Has Good Personality," To find a guy who has a good personality, you will need to start watching for behavioral signs that indicate he has the traits you desire. But first, think about what it is that you want in a guy. How do you define a good personality? Do you want someone who is kind? Funny? Outgoing? Honest? Open-minded?

Identify what you are looking for in a guy and write these traits down.Then, consider how you will be able to tell if a guy has these traits. What behaviors should you be on the lookout for?
For example, you might decide that a guy is funny if he makes you laugh when you are with him. Or, you might decide that a guy is open-minded if he talks in a way that seems accepting of different beliefs and opinions. Jot down some of the behaviors you will need to identify when you are out with a guy.;
, Watch for the personality behaviors you have identified in the guys you meet or date. If a guy displays some of the behaviors that you have decided you want, then this may indicate that he is someone you want to get to know better.

For example, you might decide that a guy is polite if he opens doors for you, says please and thank you, and gives you his full attention when you are talking rather than looking at his phone.

, Some behaviors can be red flags, so be on the lookout for these as well. For example, you might want to steer clear of a guy if he is rude to wait staff, says negative things about people when they are not around, criticizes you, has a sense of humor that you do not find funny, or shifts quickly from one mood to another.


Also watch out for a guy who talks about his ex, ignores you during your date, talks about himself the whole time, or who complains constantly.Jot down any other traits or behaviors that you do not want in a guy so that you can watch for these as well. For example, if you dislike sarcasm, then you might make a note of this as something you want to steer clear of for your own reasons.

, Do your personalities click? Even if you find someone who seems to have a great personality, he might not be a perfect match for you. Consider whether there is anything about his personality that might not mesh with yours.


For example, if he is really outgoing and you dislike crowded places and parties, then you might have a hard time compromising on weekend plans.
Think realistically about whether or not your personalities and interests would mesh well before you decide to pursue him.

, If you would like to attract a guy with a good personality, then the first step is to examine your own. Think about the list of personality traits you decided you want a guy to have. Do you have these traits? Can you work to improve any of them? If so, then start looking for ways to be more like the type of person you want to attract.


For example, if you want someone who is “comfortable being himself,” then consider if you are comfortable being yourself. Think about what you could do to be more authentic to yourself, such as wearing that funky outfit you’ve always wanted to wear, or taking a pottery class.

, One of the most attractive personality traits is kindness.If you want to attract a kind man, you can begin by practicing simple acts of kindness. Everywhere you turn there are opportunities to be kind, whether it is holding a door for someone or picking up a stray piece of litter. Begin practicing kindness and positive attraction will follow.


If you are going on a date with a guy try to be on time, allow them to order first, and push in your chair before leaving.
If there is a guy you like at work, let him see you offering to help out a co-worker in a pinch, or putting in the extra effort to help a customer.

, One of the cornerstones of a good personality is a positive attitude.Nobody really likes being around someone who is grumpy and negative. Start by examining the way you talk about yourself (to others or just in your own head). Are you saying nice things? Any time you catch yourself putting you down, stop in your tracks and make a change. The way you talk about yourself dictates your attitude toward the world.


Rather than saying, “I suck at everything,” try saying, “I’m up for a challenge.”
Avoid complaining. A major turnoff in any date situation is constant complaining.Don’t mention that the restaurant is too hot or too cold. Don’t gripe about the menu, the prices, or the service. If anything is bothering you, try to let it fade into the background, and focus on the fact that you’re on a date with a nice guy.

, If your personalities mesh, then your quirky interests will probably be attractive to him.So let your love of Harry Potter or obsession with making pottery shine! You can start the conversation off by asking, “What kind of books are you into?” or “Do you have any hobbies?” and let it unfold from there. A guy with a great personality will have plenty to talk about, and he will be interested enough to ask you the same.

, If you want to meet someone new, you are going to have to leave your house. And don't think a bar is the only place you can meet someone! If you'd like to meet a guy with a good personality, you must go to interesting places! Try visiting art museums, street fairs, or coffee shops (especially on an open mic night). You may also consider signing up some kind of community gathering, like a painting class, book club, or knitting circle.

, If you are in the market for love, one way to attract male attention is to travel is small groups. When you go out in large groups (more than three friends), you will likely intimidate the nice guy who wants your number. When you are out on the prowl, limit your numbers and open yourself to love.

, If you are open to being approached while you’re out, indicate this with your body language. Don’t stand with your shoulders square to the person you’re talking to, but instead, keep an open stance. Let your shoulders stay relaxed, and wear a smile. All of these little actions send out good vibes, and communicate that you're open to meeting a nice gentleman.

, Forget about playing it cool. If there is a nice guy out there that you’ve got your eye on, let him know that you’re interested. You can do this in a more subtle way by paying him a lot of attention, making eye contact, and asking questions when he speaks. Or if you’re feeling cavalier, just come right out and tell him.


You could say, “I think we have great chemistry together. Would you want to grab dinner sometime?”

Be positive.,
Be confident.,
Watch your body language.",How to Attract a Guy1," If you believe all men want a blonde with large breasts, you'll act like it. Every man is attracted to a different type of woman. Relax. Yours is out there.



Smile. Such a simple thing does wonders. Positive, smiling people light up a room and others are automatically attracted to them. Moods are contagious--if you make others feel good, they'll seek to be around you.
Compliment others. This includes him! The old adage ""What goes around comes around"" is true. Cultivating an aura of positivity that others can benefit from will encourage them to return the favor.

What's more, accept compliments with grace. If a guy tells you that you look nice, smile and say, ""Thanks!"" Don't brush off his statement or disagree with him.

;
, Thinking you're awesome makes it easier for others to see you're awesome, too.


Think of all your positive attributes. Though nobody's perfect, we all have something others envy. Write down what you love about yourself and go over the list every day.
Limit your complaining. We all struggle with our weight and with friends. If you have a problem, do talk about it--but don't fill empty silences with griping. Keeping your mind on bigger, happier things will make it easier to give off the impression you want.
Be proud of your accomplishments. Did you ace that test? Score the most points in your last volleyball game? Go ahead, brag a little! Don't be afraid to talk about the impressive things you do.

Make sure not to be self-centered. Being proud of yourself and conceited are two very different things.


Compare yourself to your former self, not to those around you. Make the goal to be better than who you were, not better than others in your life. There will always be people better and worse off than you.

, Keeping an open, welcoming stance will show any guy that you are approachable and ready to talk.


Make eye contact. Shying away from someone shows them that you're nervous and may not want to engage. Holding his gaze will let him know that you're interested and deserve his attention.
Stay open and friendly. Crossing your arms may give off the impression that you're not looking for conversation. If you see a guy you may be interested in, angle your body towards him, signaling that interest.

Being open also involves not being preoccupied with something else. Checking your phone every 2 minutes tells the world that you aren't present and involved in your surroundings. Set it down and make yourself available.


Touch him lightly. The bond of human touch is irreversible. If you're involved in conversation, touch him sweetly on the arm or knee to tell him you're listening and captivated.

Use your intelligence to your advantage.,
Focus on finding a good match, not getting every girl (or any girl).,
Socialize with intelligent girls.,
Find subjects of conversation that work for both you and your potential partner.,
Show girls you are available and interested.,
Find your flirting style.,
Treat women well.",How to Attract a Girl As an Exceptionally Intelligent Guy," Most girls like a guy who thinks on many levels and has some element of ""culture"" to him. If you have (or can develop) a polished vocabulary and speech style, many girls will take notice. Add some charm to the mix and they will find you quite attractive.


Don't conceal your intelligence—you want to attract girls who like smart guys, and it's not good to lie about who you are.;
, Just as you aren't attracted to every girl, not every girl will be attracted to you, and that's okay. You're better off waiting for someone who is a good fit. If you are rejected by the girl you've got your eye on, then tell yourself it just wasn't a good match, and move on.


If you're shy or very romantic, it may be extremely hard to let a girl go. It's okay to feel deeply about someone, but it's also important to respect her boundaries. Keep in mind that she is an individual with her own life and feelings, and you need to respect that—no means no, and if you don't listen, she may feel annoyed or even frightened.

, Many intelligent girls desire a partner who they can have a meaningful conversation with and will appreciate their intellect for all it is. If you're in school, talk to girls who take Advanced/AP/Honors classes. If you're working in science, engineering, or similar fields, look to your coworkers. Find women who excel.


Keep in mind that advanced classes or a career in science don't necessarily indicate intelligence, and any C student or secretary could be extremely intelligent, but can't or won't adhere to conventional standards for ""smart"" people.
A part of sexist thinking is that girls should pretend to be less intelligent than guys, for fear of emasculating them. Show girls that you do not follow that mindset and are perfectly okay with their full intelligence. They will appreciate your respect.

, What does she like? What do you two have in common? If she is also intellectual, this may be easier, because your interests will most likely overlap more. If you can find topics that the two of you enjoy, then you just might be a good match.

, Most girls won't approach a guy reading a book in the corner or staring down at his cell phone, so don't be too preoccupied if you want someone to come. Have open body language: keep your arms uncrossed, sit up straight, and direct your feet/torso toward a girl, whether she is talking to you or sitting nearby. If you see her looking, smile and see how she responds. An inviting smile can get you a long way.

, Flirting helps you determine whether a girl is interested by offering her a chance to reciprocate and get to know you better. There are plenty of ways to flirt, and you can find your individual style, from gentlemanly to sweet. As you get to know a girl, you'll see what sort of flirting she enjoys most. Here are some examples of flirting:


Looking across the room, catching her eye, and smiling
Finding an excuse to walk over to her
Touching her arm or arranging her clothes/hair
Complimenting her
Listening to her and asking questions to get to know her

, Girls look for partners who respect them and are good listeners. Work on being polite and warmhearted, and you will have found your natural charm. Treat women like your equals, do kind things for them, and don't be surprised if you notice some of them getting crushes on you.

"
Practice good hygiene.,
Find your style.",How to Attract a Guy2," Taking showers regularly and keeping up on your appearance is the first step to showing the world you're interested in it.


Deodorant and toothpaste do great things for unwanted scents. Applying deodorant every day and brushing your teeth after each meal will ensure that you're always looking and feeling fresh and clean.
Light make-up will enhance your best features. Make sure not to go too overboard; most men prefer a more natural look. Too much make-up says you're not beautiful without it--which clearly isn't true!

, Whatever you feel best in looks best on you. Whether it's dresses, t-shirts, or leather cowboy boots, your clothes are a symbol of you.


Don't try to fit in with a certain look. You want to attract guys that like you--not who you are trying to be.
Dress for the occasion. It may be tempting to wear sweatpants to your cousin's bar mitzvah, but negative attention is not what you want.

"
"
Get energized.,
Cultivate your passions.,
Stay healthy.",How to Attract a Guy3," Finding and sticking to an exercise routine leads to higher levels of energy, better sleep, and a clearer complexion. That's not even including the health benefits and trimmer waistline!


A simple thing like going for a walk every day contributes to overall health. If you have time (and the ability) for a daily trip to the gym, great! But if not, stay active with smaller things: walk the dog, play tennis, or go swimming.

, A girl with interests is an interesting girl. Having your own identity is key to attracting a man: If even you don't know who you are, how can he?


Find hobbies. There are loads of things you're good at. Once you find the things you enjoy, you'll find guys with similar interests. Having things in common makes it easier to communicate and start a relationship.
Your passions should include other relationships. Don't neglect your friends and family in concentrating on finding a guy. Surrounding yourself with others who care about you will help you grow and become a more well-rounded, positive person.

, A balanced, nutrient-rich diet works wonders on the body and mind. Your body is a temple--don't put things into it that are harmful.


Getting enough vitamins and minerals will make your hair and nails grow faster and thicker, in addition to your skin glowing and looking healthier. This means loading up on the fruits and veggies and cutting down on the processed goods.
Kick those nasty habits. Drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes adds years to a person's appearance. Not to mention the bad breath and body odor.

"
"
Stay open to opportunities.,
Show him who you are.,
Feel it out.",How to Attract a Guy4," You may think you know what kind of guy you are looking for until one surprises you. Taking risks and going with the flow leads to more experiences and more connections.


Say ""yes."" If you're interested in a guy, don't shut down the conversation. He loves snowboarding? Great! Maybe you know nothing about it, but could he take you next week?
Play along. If he's teasing you, don't over-analyze. Tease him back! Show him you can be sharp, funny, and take a joke, too.

, A confident, dynamic, open girl is hard to resist. Being yourself and showing him your best qualities is the only way to market yourself.


Are you funny? Crack a joke! If you're strong, embrace it! Never alter your personality for who you think someone else wants you to be. It won't stick.
Share your interests. You'll never know if you have something in common if you don't talk about yourself. Letting him get to know you allows him to see how unique you are.
Talk about your life. Including him in on your friends and family will make him feel more attached to you. After all, they're the ones who have shaped you. While being mysterious can be attractive, you want to show him you're a real person who can be trusted.

, We can never guess who we'll click with. If you've made a connection with a guy, be sure to follow up. If he's coming off as unavailable, no problem.


He's laughing, you're laughing, and you've been talking for ages. Don't be afraid to take it to the next level. Find something he's interested in and make a suggestion to do it together. If he's interested, he'll take the conversation and run with it.
If a guy you're attracted to isn't attracted to you back, there's no use in even thinking about it; it could be one of a million reasons. He could be in a relationship, newly single and not ready, or just not feeling it at the moment. Remember: don't take it personally. He is one of billions of guys. You'll be fine. Mostly likely you'll forget it about when...wait. Who's that cute guy over there?

Build your confidence.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Make sure your teeth are clean.,
Use your clothes to enhance.,
Don’t overwhelm with scent.",How to Attract a Girl1," Confidence is one of those qualities that girls find attractive. Now, confidence doesn't equal arrogance, so there's a fine line that you'll need to walk. Fortunately, you can build your confidence, it's not something that you're just born with.Fake confidence until you actually start to feel confident. You can do this by doing confident things, even if you don't feel it. Start small and work your way up. For example: if you're shy, strike up conversation with one person you don't know each day. Work your way up to striking up conversation with that cute girl you've been eying.
Use confident body postures to convey confidence and trick yourself into being confident. Stand with your legs apart and your hands on your hips. Don't cross your arms across your chest (this comes across as being not confident).
Chew gum. Weirdly, not only does chewing gum make your breath smell nice (which can be attractive to a girl), but it can actually reduce your stress. So before you're around the girl you're looking to attract, pop a stick of gum in your mouth.;
, The definition of hygiene very much depends on where in the world you are. Certain places have higher or lower standards of hygiene and you'll be more likely to attract a girl with more or less cleanliness. (For example: if you lived in rural Alaska, you would probably attract a girl with less cleanliness than Los Angeles.)


Bathe at least once a week. This is, obviously, just a guideline, but it's a good idea to clean yourself at least occasionally. While there is research that supports women finding men's sweat attractive, you don't want to overwhelm her with your sweat.
Keep your clothes laundered. Again, a little sweat and a little scent isn't a bad thing, but you want your clothes to be at least moderately clean.

, White teeth are definitely a sign of attractiveness. More than your physical features a girl is likely to be attracted to clean, white, healthy teeth, so make sure that you're brushing twice a day, at least, and flossing regularly.


White teeth are one of the first things women (or anyone) will notice, so it's important that you take good care of them.
You also want your breath to smell good, which means brushing your tongue, as well, especially at the back of your mouth.

, Clothes can be an important indicator of confidence, and of attractiveness. Again, it really depends on where you are in terms of your main wardrobe (what goes over well and is necessary in rural Alaska is going to be very different from what is necessary and stylish in Los Angeles). There are a few basic things to keep in mind, however.Make sure your jeans, or whatever trousers you're wearing, fit you. Clothes that fit can enhance your body. Baggy clothing hides your body, or makes you look sloppy, while too-tight clothing looks good on basically no one.
Buy nice shoes. While not all girls are obsessed with shoes (or clothes) a good pair of shoes can make you look put together, which is something a girl will register, whether she does it subconsciously or not.
Pick colors that work with your skin tone, eye color, and facial features. If you have a nice pair of green eyes, wear a forest green sweater that makes them pop. Red and black are very good colors to wear if you're looking to attract. Both red and black make you appear more powerful., There's nothing wrong with a little scent, especially if you live somewhere that is big on colognes and body spray. But you want to make sure that you don't overwhelm the girl you're looking to attract. You may also want to consider not covering up your natural scent. Women tend to be attracted to a man's sweat.Just make sure that you aren't overwhelming anyone with your body odor. It's a good balance that you have to strike. If you're of the type who sweats a lot, make sure that you wash frequently and change your shirts.
Cologne and body spray can add a nice little accent to your appearance as long as you don't go overboard. Spritz a little behind your ear, on your face and chin (one spritz should do it) and on your chest. You want to make sure that your cologne or body spray mingles with your natural scent and pheromones."

Find your passion.,
Try new things.,
Cultivate the art of listening.,
Treat people well.",How to Attract a Girl2," People are attracted to those who know who they are, are confident about that, and who have passion about something. Passion about things (like sports, or rock climbing, cooking, or writing) can translate into passion for another person, which is an attractive quality.


Having things that you're passionate about gives you something to talk about. It's one reason why nerds are big right now, because nerds aren't afraid to be passionate about the things that they like.
Figure out what it is that you enjoy. This means giving lots of different things a try to pursuing the things that you love. Don't be afraid to screw up or not be good at something when you first start out (very few people can make a flan on the first try, for example). Being able to make mistakes without letting it upset your equilibrium is an attractive quality.

, This will help you push the limits of your comfort zone, which in turn makes you more confident in handling the things life pushes at you. It also means that you're more likely to be able to talk to a girl you want to attract. Doing things, being game for trying things out is a quality that can attract a girl.


Take a dance or cooking class. If you want to know where girls are, they often take dance or cooking classes. A man who can dance or who can cook is a big catch among the ladies. It also shows that you don't really care what people think about you, which shows that you're confident.
You’ll meet new people and have interesting experiences to talk about. Being a good conversationalist, telling interesting stories, having a life can all attract a girl.

, Listening, real listening, is a lost art. People are so busy wanting to talk about themselves, or checking their phone, that they have a tendency not to really listen. If you show that you care what other people have to say, you'll show that you're a good bet as a partner.


When someone is talking to you, make sure that you give them your full attention. Make eye contact, avoid checking your phone. If you don't feel comfortable making eye contact, try to look over one of their shoulders, or at their forehead, because it will look like you're making eye contact, without actually having to do that.
Listen to all people, even girls you don’t find attractive. This shows that you respect people and that you think all people are important and you're not just listening to someone because you want to get into her pants. Unless she's only looking for a one-night stand, a girl doesn't want to feel like you're only paying attention to her because you want to have sex with her.

, All people. When you're at the grocery store make sure that you thank the clerk. When you're at a restaurant, tip the waiter or waitress well. Look people in the eye and make them feel like you've seen them, that they aren't invisible to you.


This doesn’t necessarily mean be a pushover. If someone says something rude or disparaging towards you, you have every right to call them out.
Treating people well means holding the door for that little old lady, or helping carry her groceries. It means offering rides to your friends because they can't afford a car, and so on. If you get into the habit of treating people well, girls will notice that.

"
"
Approach her with respect.,
Ask her questions about herself.,
Be playful.,
Flirt with a girl.",How to Attract a Girl3," Always approach a girl with the underlying realization that she is, first and foremost, a human being and thus is worthy of respect (it doesn't matter what she's wearing, how drunk she is, or how she's acting). Girls are often taught that they don't deserve respect, so you'll stand out from a lot of other guys.


Make sure that you have respect for yourself, too. This is about confidence. When you talk to or approach a girl, don't base your happiness on whether she's going to be interested in you. When you make it seem like you're desperate. Politely engage her in conversation and if she doesn't seem interested, back off.
Be respectful to other people when you're around her (this ties in with treating people well). Avoid degrading women, whether it's by telling a rape joke (just don't), calling other guys ""pussies"" or using words like ""that bitch"" to talk about your ex-girlfriend. You'll come across as disrespectful and immature.
A lot of guys mix up being confident with being arrogant and awful. They say that women only want horrible guys who treat them poorly. The thing about this type of guy is that he exudes confidence. It tends to be the confidence rather than the crappy behavior that girls are attracted to.

, Make it seem like you're actually interested in what she has to say. Instead of jumping right in with something about yourself, follow up with another question about what she just said. Girls, like anyone else, like to think that people are interested in their thoughts and opinions.


For example: you might ask her about her job and when she tells you she's working as a barista, ask her how she likes it, what's her favorite part about the job, what's her least favorite part.
Obviously make sure that you listen to what she says. Don't just be formulating your next question, or it'll seem like you're interrogating her without caring about the answers.
Don’t get too personal too quickly. If you've only just met the girl, don't jump right in asking about her relationship with her family, or whether she has any deep dark secrets (although asking this as a joke might be okay depending on the girl). if the two of you end up dating, there'll be time for that later.

, You don't have to have a big shit-eating grin when you're hanging out with her, but it's a good idea to make your interactions fun. She'll remember that being around you was fun and kind of charged (flirting is good for that).


Rather than a big open smile, consider having a kind of half-smile. This is often more attractive to girls than full-on grinning.
Make her laugh. Tell funny stories. Real ones are the best ones, especially ones where you come off as human. It shows that you can laugh at yourself. For example: you might tell her about the time you tried to scare your dad when he was coming out of the gym locker room, only to scare a completely random person.
Be careful with humor, because not everyone has the same type of humor. Make sure that you're gauging your reaction. Is she laughing hard at what you're saying, or only laughing politely. Avoid harmful humor, as well, such as racist or sexist jokes.

, Flirting can be a bit hit or miss, but it's a great way to create a fun, light atmosphere. It can also get a bit charged and leave her wanting more. Make sure you go by each individual girl's reaction, because every girl is different in what she likes and dislikes.


Tease her gently. Don't be mean about what you say, but gently poke fun at her. For example: tell her that you can out-dance her on the dance. If she is a better dancer, pretend that you are, instead.
Eye contact is an extremely important part of flirting. Keep eye contact with the girl that you're interested in, across the bar, while you're in conversation. It'll build a real charge of energy between the two of you. Watch her tone if she need some space let her in.

Be confident and act natural.,

Be specific and flexible.,
Don't get upset if they just want to be friends.",How to Ask out Someone Who Likes You1," Act like you normally would when you're around that person. Don't act nervous or scared, and try to come off confident. Stand tall, with your shoulders back and head up.When you speak, use your normal tone of voice and breathe deeply to relax if you're nervous.


To project confidence, make sure you don't fidget (put your hands in your pockets or hold something to keep your hands occupied). Make eye contact, smile, and speak slowly and clearly.
If you are confident that the person likes you, it should lessen your fear of rejection.;
, Walk up to the person and start a conversation about something. You can start a conversation about anything, including how their day is going so far, or a recent episode of a show you both like. This will make it feel more natural when you ask them out and will make you feel more comfortable. Make sure to take them to a secluded place where there aren't other people around.


To start the conversation you can say something like, ""Hey, did you see last night's episode of American Horror Story? It was so crazy.""
You can also say something like, ""Hey, how's your day going so far?""

, When there is a lull in the conversation, ask them if they'd like to go out on a date. Be clear and confident when you ask them so that there's no room for confusion.Asking someone to be your girlfriend or boyfriend is asking someone whether they want to be exclusively romantic with you. Before this step, you need to go on a couple of dates first to establish the fact that you're ""dating.""


To establish that you want to go on a ""date"" rather than hang out as friends, you can say, ""Hey, do you want to go out on a date with me over the weekend?""
If you've already gone on dates with the person and you want them to be your boyfriend or girlfriend, you can say something like, ""I like when we hang out and go on dates. I'm not interested in going out with anyone else — do you want to be exclusive?""

, Instead of asking someone if they want to go on a date ""sometime,"" get specific with what you're asking them. For instance, you can say something like, ""Would you like to go the movies on Friday at 6?"" This will make them either give you a yes or a no and will clue them into how you feel about them. Don't get upset if they are already busy or have plans. Instead, offer up another time and date that works for them. If they already have plans for the day, you can say something like, ""Oh, okay, well do you have free time next week?""
If they say they don't have time at all, then drop it and wait until they feel comfortable going out with you.

, There is a chance that the person that you think likes you only likes you as a friend and not in a romantic manner. If they tell you this, don't be upset and don't ruin your relationship with the person. As a true friend, you should stay friends with them and respect how they feel. Instead of obsessing over the rejection or feeling down, move on and work to build a stronger friendship with the person.



If they say no, you can say something like, ""Oh okay, that's totally cool. I just thought that you liked me that way, but I feel totally alright with just being friends.""

Ask them if they like you.,
Watch their body language.,
Consider how often the person wants to be around you.,
Listen to them.",How to Ask out Someone Who Likes You2," The easiest way to determine if someone likes you is by asking them outright. Choose a person that shares similar interests and evaluate their values. Give yourself time to get to know the person first. If you both enjoy each other's company and often have the same opinion on issues, there's a good chance that they like you.If the person tries to talk about deeper and personal things rather than superficial pleasantries, it's a good chance that they may like you.You can say something like, ""Hey, I really have a good time hanging out with you. Would you like to go on a date?""
You can also say something like, ""I noticed that we are similar in a lot of different ways, and I like spending time with you. Do you feel the same way?""

, Someone's body language may clue you to if they like you or not. Take note if the person leans into you, and exhibits open body language when they are around you. Frequent, prolonged eye contact or gazing in your direction is also another sign.If they look comfortable, relaxed, and happy, it's a good indication that they like being around you. If they touch you on the shoulder or arm, it's another sign that they are into you.


Take note of how the person interacts with other people as well. Do they pay you special attention or is this person regularly flirtatious with others as well?
If the person crosses their arms or legs and sits pointing away from you, this could be an indication that they don't like you., If the individual always wants to be around you or makes excuses to be in your presence, there's a chance that they like you.Going out of their way to talk to you at recess or lunch is a good sign that they like you.

, When a person likes you, they will usually give you compliments. This is a sign that they like you. Consider how close you are to the person and how personal they try to get with you. If they ask you how you feel emotionally or try to get intimate details about your life, there's a chance that they like you. If they ask you what you're doing over the weekend or seem curious to what you do on your free time, there's a good likelihood that they would be receptive to spending social time with you.


Concentrate on what they have to say and take it in and internalize it. Instead of spending time thinking about your response, hear them out."

You can say something like, ""We started off as friends, but the more we hang out, the more I'm developing feelings for you and would like to take you out on dates. Would you be open to that?""

, Speak to a mutual friend and try to get a confirmation that the person likes you. Explain that you are open to dating them, but aren't sure if they feel the same way. If it's a good mutual friend, they will tell you the truth. Once you confirm that they like you, ask your mutual friend if they would talk to the person you have your eye on.

And that's going to take getting to know her rather than fronting up and asking her out straight away. Find ways that she seems comfortable with that let the two of you spend some time together without strings attached. This could be any one or a combination of the following:


Be study buddies. Pick each other's brains for ideas and solutions to schoolwork or college assignments.
Sit with her in the cafeteria at lunch and simply chat about everyday life.
Compliment her on her reading choices and talk about books together.
Visit her performance when she is playing an instrument, hitting a ball or dancing up a whirl. Be supportive by being in the audience and coming up and congratulating her afterward.;
, Do what you can to find chatting opportunities, be they in the hallway, in the library (quietly!) or on the way home from school or college. Perhaps you catch the same bus home or maybe you share the same walkover from class to class––whatever the case, seize the opportunities to have small talk with her. And when you do:


Ask her questions to help draw her out of her shell.
Be receptive to her conversation. Be a great listener and be supportive of the things she tells you.
Don't interrupt her. Let her say what she wishes to say, at her pace.
Talk only a little about yourself. She can find out more later, and a little mystery is a great thing.

, They will be a useful source of support and information as things become more serious. They can also serve as a source of reassurance to her, helping her to realize that you mean well and are worth letting down her barriers for.

, She's probably not going to tell you but she'll be giving away some signals if she does like you. If she does like you, she might:


Blush a bit: For example, when you walk up to her and say a casual ""hi!"", she smiles, nods, blushes, and murmurs something about getting to class, then hurries in opposite direction.
Stare a little: When she sees you in the hallway, she will quicken her pace and turn away but look back just before she turns the corner and meets your gaze.
Glance at you: If you are in the same class as her, watch her out of the corner of your eye. Don't stare though, you don't want to come on too strong! Chances are she'll be doing the same thing, and quickly turn back to her work if she meets your gaze.
Act nervous: She blushes a lot when you are near her or has numerous little smiles that fade quickly.
Chews her bottom lip, and acts flustered if you talk to her.
Makes eye contact: Eventually, she might be brave enough to meet your eyes, give a small smile, then look away.

, Break the touch barrier and touch her shoulder, lightly tease-punch her, patting her back after something impressive. Compliment her a little, but not too much. Try hugging her that Friday before you go.

, If you're not confident in yourself, how can she be confident in both of you together in a relationship? Look at yourself in a positive way and believe that you are Mr. Right.

, Imagine that you are the shy girl that you want to ask out. Figure out a comfortable way to ask her out without making yourself feel shy or embarrassed. Don't overdo it though, you don't want a long speech just a cute conversation.

, Don't walk up to her like you're about to tell her something that will change her life. Act like you normally do when you are starting a conversation with her.

, Tell her she looks beautiful in that top or that her eyes are gorgeous. It may seem a little cheesy, but this gives her the hint that you are interested and makes her feel like she knows what's coming.

, Say something like ""Hey maybe if you aren't busy, we can hang out later."" or whatever you want to do with her. Say this with your best smile and while slowly getting close to her.

, If she says no, simply back down and say maybe another time. If she says yes, act excited and make plans. Either way, you shouldn't act depressed because this will surely make her even more shy around you.

Don’t insist if you don’t get a number.",How to Ask for a Phone Number," If there's one single thing you can do to make it easier to ask people for their numbers, make it this! Though it's always difficult (some might say almost impossible) to force yourself to relax once you're already in a stressful situation, approaching social encounters where you think you'll probably ask for someone's number with a calm, relaxed attitude makes it much easier to pop the difficult question (and makes you look supremely confident to boot). Though everyone relaxes differently, you may want to try experimenting with some of the following relaxation methods:


Meditation
Yoga
Physical exercise
Deep breathing
Making yourself laugh
Thinking of the people around you as laughable (e.g., that they're in their underwear, etc.);
, Often, working up the courage to talk to people you're attracted to in the first place is way harder than actually asking for their numbers. To have the best chance of getting a number, you have to be willing to immediately take the plunge and talk to people you find attractive without giving yourself a chance to over-analyze the situation and find a reason not to. Don't give yourself any opportunities to chicken out! It's much, much harder to get numbers if you don't ever approach and talk to people you find attractive.


If you're having a hard time finding the nerve to approach an attractive person, force yourself to act. Try giving yourself a hard time limit (10 seconds, for instance, if you're feeling bold) for waiting and worrying before you walk over and talk to someone and stick to this time limit! If you're with friends, have them agree to ""push"" you into social interactions instead of giving you opportunities to wiggle out of them.

, If you look confident, most people will think you are confident — they have no way to know that you're sweating bullets on the inside unless you tell them! Take advantage of this and use proud, confident body language to give your flirting game an immediate boost. The best part of doing this is that it's part of a self-reinforcing cycle: when people react favorably to your confident behavior, you'll feel more confident, making it easier to sincerely act confident. Regardless of your sex or appearance, here are just a few universal tips for making yourself look as confident as possible:Don't be afraid to take up space. Hold your head high and stand up straight. Pull your shoulders back and puff your chest out. Take a wide, relaxed stance when you sit.
Use strong, relaxed movements. Walk with long, slow strides. Use large, smooth, easy gestures.
Show your attention. Position yourself to face people when you're talking to them. Use eye contact, but don't stare.
Don't close yourself off to others. Don't cross your arms or legs when you sit down. Don't play with your phone when you're bored. These behaviors telegraph to others that you're not interested in interacting.

, Let's be realistic — not everyone is going to be immediately comfortable approaching strangers to talk to them and ask for their number. If you fall into this category, it's OK to contrive a reason to talk to someone to get the conversation flowing. So-called ""conversation-starters"" are some of the oldest tricks in the book when it comes to flirting and making connections with other people, but they're surprisingly effective. Don't worry — if you eventually get around to asking for this person's number, you don't have to worry about being phony! Below are just a few conversation starters to get the ball rolling:


Ask for advice: ""Hey, I like Dostoevsky and I noticed you reading Notes From Underground — would you recommend it?""
Compliment or comment on a shared interest: ""Nice Creed shirt! Did you see them when they were in town back in 2001?""
Enlist their help: ""Wow! Can you show me how to dance like that?""
The old standby: ""Do you have a light?"" (Only works for smokers).

, No one likes being put on the spot, so when you're going for a phone number, keep things low-pressure. Resist the urge to open with a cheesy pickup line or come-on. Though there's something to be said for the confidence required for making your intentions known immediately, this sort of approach can sometimes make you seem predatory or insincere. For most people, a better idea is to stay casual. If you need to, use a basic conversation starter to open your conversation, then simply relax and continue as feels natural, making amicable small talk until things heat up!


One of the benefits of taking a casual approach is that it allows you to avoid the embarrassment of outright rejection. If you're having a casual conversation with someone and you sense things becoming awkward, you can always end the conversation by claiming that you have something else you need to do. On the other hand, if you open your conversation with an obvious come-on, if things turn awkward, ending the conversation prematurely will be a little more embarrassing because it will be obvious that you've failed at what you set out to do.

, If you're aiming to get someone's phone number, once you start a conversation with this person, look for an opportunity to set yourself apart from the other people this person may talk to after you by making a personal connection. You can do this by finding something that you both enjoy, having a friendly, spirited debate about something you don't both enjoy, or even just telling each other about your lives. When you make a connection with someone, it should be immediately obvious — the conversation should ""spark"" and become more lively, heated, and intimate.


For instance, let's say you're at a party where you don't know many people and you've worked up the courage to start talking to an attractive stranger by commenting on the band on their T-shirt. If it turns out that you've both seen this act live, take this opportunity to share your experiences in the mosh pit. With luck, your shared experiences should help you create a personal connection that will it much easier (and more appropriate) to ask for someone's number.

, One of the surest ways to make a lasting positive impression on someone is simply to be funny. Everyone loves to laugh! Humor feels good, so people are much more likely to give you their number and to want to spend time with you down the road if they think that you have a good sense of humor. In addition, it's worth mentioning that some scientific research has shown that humor and playfulness is one of the very most attractive traits a person can have in social interactions with others.While you'll definitely want to show off your good sense of humor if you have it, beware self-deprecating humor. Don’t make people laugh ‘’at you’’ — while a little self-deprecation can be great fun once you've gotten to know someone, making fun of yourself when you're first meeting them can make you look nervous and unsure of yourself, rather than relaxed and confident.

, The best time to ask for someone's number is usually right after you've shared a good laugh, made a notable connection, or otherwise had a good time — in other words, end on a high note! People are generally more willing to agree with you if they like you, so asking for a number right after you've scored major conversational points will boost your chances of getting the number (and make the person you're talking to more likely to let you down gently if they don't want to give you their number).


Let's continue with the example situation described above. If you've had a pleasant conversation talking about your mutual love of the band on your conversation partner's T shirt, you might want to end the conversation with a funny story about something that happened to you at a different band's show. Once you get a big laugh, say that you've got to run, but that you should exchange numbers so you can talk more later. With any luck, your great timing will increase your chances for success.

, Asking for someone's number is something that's generally done at the end of a conversation — not in the middle. Once you've gotten someone's number, don't let the conversation stagnate or become awkward. Instead, quickly wrap the conversation up and leave to do something else. This will give the impression that you've got a busy, active life (which usually comes across as attractive) and hopefully leave the person you've been talking to with lingering unanswered questions that will require another conversation to answer.


In our example, as noted above, we should end the conversation by asking for the number of the person we're talking to, instead of asking for the number and then continuing with the conversation as normal. It's obvious why this sort of behavior should be avoided if we imagine what it might sound like: ""Thanks for your number! So, did you see any interesting movies lately?"" Returning to friendly small talk after escalating things into borderline-romantic territory can lead to awkwardness (even when handled well) and can give serious mixed signals.

, It can be quite embarrassing to outright refuse to give someone a phone number after you're asked for it. One of the ways people get around this potential awkwardness is by giving a fake number. If you've just gotten someone's number, taking a quick moment to verify it by calling or sending a text can save you from disappointment in a few days' time if it turns out to be a fake. Try texting ""This is (your name)"" or calling a minute or two after you end the conversation. If you get a response, you'll know the number is the real deal. On the other hand, if you can't get through, you reach someone who's clearly not the person you were just talking to, or you receive an error message, you'll know you have a fake.


Don't get upset or raise a scene if it turns out that you've been given a fake number. Have a quick laugh over the fact that you've been duped and immediately forget about it. No one is obliged to give you their phone number, so you shouldn't feel like you've been betrayed if they don't give you it!

, This is an old dating rule, but it's still good advice today. When you get someone's phone number, don't call this person back the next morning or even the next evening — instead, wait at least a few days before you make contact. While calling immediately may be what you want to do when you're feeling overjoyed at getting an attractive new friend's number, calling too early can give the impression that you're taking the potential of your relationship more seriously than is warranted, which can be a turn-off (especially for people who aren't looking for a big commitment). Note that some relationship experts recommend waiting as long as a week before calling, while others opt for a less conservative minimum waiting period, like three days.You’re trying to keep things casual at this point. Calling immediately after you get a number can make it seem like you’re taking the connection you made with this person much more seriously than is warranted. Ironically, this can hurt your potential for serious dating in the long run.

, Thought it's a good idea to approach conversations with people you're attracted to without hesitation, there is such a thing as being too forward. When you want someone's number, don't let the very first words out of your mouth be, ""Can I have your number?"" To some (misguided) people, being this up-front is a way to demonstrate extreme confidence. However, to most, this simply appears bizarre. Unless you're an expert player or you're trying to experiment or challenge yourself, you'll probably have better luck with a more conventional approach.

, No matter how smooth and confident you are, rejection is always a possibility — even if absolutely everyone you talk to finds you irresistible, some will still be ""taken!"" Because you won't get the number you're looking for all (or even most) of the time, it's best to keep your expectations in check. Try not to worry about whether you'll get a number when you start talking to someone you're attracted to. Instead, focus on enjoying yourself, listening to your conversation partner, and making a connection with a new person. This way, if you do choose to ask for a number at the end of your conversation, you won't have any reason to be disappointed even if you get rejected — you still accomplished most of what you set out to do!

, Asking for a number is something you should do at the end of conversations that go well — not ones that don't go so well. If your conversation turns awkward for some reason (like, for instance, if you accidentally offend the person you're talking to) don't try to salvage it by asking for a number. Instead, either gracefully excuse yourself and end the conversation, or, if you really want the number, keep talking and try to repair the damage you've done before you ask. There's nothing worse than asking someone who's clearly uncomfortable for their number, so try to spare yourself (and your conversation partner) from this unfortunate outcome.

, As noted above, there are a variety of reasons (good and bad) why someone might decline to give you their number. If you feel the sting of rejection, don't take things out on the person who's rejected you. This person was never under any obligation to share their number, so no matter how lively your conversation was, it's not ""wrong"" of them to withhold their number when you ask for it if they want to. Reacting with anger or acting mopey after someone has refused to give you their number is always a bad idea — it can make you look petty, vain, and entitled under the best of circumstances, so just don't do it. Below are just a few perfectly legitimate reasons why someone may not want to share their number (there are obviously many more):


Being in a serious relationship
Having just gotten out of a serious relationship
Not being comfortable giving their phone number to strangers
Not looking for romantic opportunities
Not being as attracted to you as you are to them

Wait until the person is alone.,
Smile and politely make eye contact.,
Approach them calmly and casually.,
Keep the conversation moving forward.,
Stay confident throughout the conversation.,

Keep your head up.",How to Ask Someone out if You're Shy," Focus on the three key things that make a difference: hygiene and style, plus a smile. Be clean, wear comfortable and well maintained clothes, and always remember to smile. Smiling can automatically make you more relatable and radiant.Make sure to brush your teeth or use mouthwash. Bad breath is a real turnoff.;
, There is nothing quite so helpful as rehearsal; preparing your mind helps you to feel familiar with the situation. And when you have a speech prepared, it will go a lot better. If you don't practice you may blurt out: 'ummm er wanna...go out...with, umm...let's date' or something silly like that. Keep practicing until it feels natural, or at least okay. Practice conversation starters such as:


”Hey, how is your day going?”
""Hey, you're Greg’s friend aren't you?”
“Do you want to hang out sometime?""
”Would you like to go to dinner or grab a coffee sometime?”

, Confidence is important in any human interaction, but especially when asking someone out. Having confidence can help stop any stress or nervousness that might come up. Breathe deeply and focus on yourself overcoming your shyness., Look for a time to ask the special someone out when it is not too noisy or hectic (Crossing a busy street, standing in line at a crowded restaurant). Also don’t be somewhere quiet enough to get other people's attention and make the situation uncomfortable.

, You may not want to ask anyone out when they are with friends. They may get shy and it could turn into an uncomfortable moment. Being alone will also let you stay focused on the person you are trying to talk to without any interference from others.

, Don't stare, just give a sweet, cute smile and when they look at you, look for a bit then quickly look away. See if you get eye contact or a smile back. If so, that is a great sign that they may be interested in you.

, When they're sitting alone just sit next to them and eventually start a general chat. If it is someone you have never talked to before, start off a conversation with “Hey, do you mind if I join you?” If you're already acquaintances, ask them casual things such as ""Hey, How are you?.... How have things been?”

, Bring up your current location or the occasion (if it is at a party or meeting) you are attending to keep the conversation from getting too stale.Also, try to find a common interest that you share with the person to talk about in greater detail. Examples could be:


Entertainment
Travel
Reading
Art
School

, Keep your head held high. Be proud of yourself at all times. If you blush, or your shyness comes up in conversation, embrace it. Do not be embarrassed, but casually joke about it or speak about it lightheartedly.Understand that if you make a mistake or stumble on your words then the other person probably won’t notice or care., Once you have established a conversation that you think is going well, close out by asking the person on a date. Look them in the eye and use the lines you rehearsed to be clear and confident with your question. Start off small and ask them out to a movie, dinner or cup of coffee.


Make sure to exchange contact information and be clear on the time and place where the date will occur.

, If you get rejected, understand that rejection is a common thing that happens to everyone. The most important thing is to learn from the rejection and continue to try your luck elsewhere. Maybe it wasn’t meant to be with the person you liked. But you did get over your shyness and asked them out! That confirms that you can do again.

Being too eager, too bold, or too aggressive in your approach can cause her to raise her defenses before you’ve even made a play. “He’s just another one of THOSE guys,” she may say to herself. This will doom your goal.A boor will say something like, “Hey, what time does your shift end?” Not only is this a terrible line but it is also creepy, making it seem as though you will be waiting for her at closing time.
Don’t be so transparent, and don’t be creepy. Instead, try engaging her in conversation, i.e. “This is my first time here. Wow, are you always so busy on Tuesdays?”;
, Like with flirting, you should be a gentleman and on your best behavior. Make it clear that you are nice, respectful, and thoughtful – again, not some creep. Employ the usual trappings of politeness that you use in other social situations.


Say please and thank you. A waitress is serving you, but she is still a person and should be treated like it.This is just normal kindness.
Don’t call her sweetheart or any other “pet name.” It is condescending. Also, don’t stare at her. She may well be very pretty, but you will probably make her uncomfortable.
Avoid complaining about the restaurant. Your waitress did not write the menu, set the prices, design the décore. Nor does she control how busy the establishment is. Complaining will only put her off.
You might try empathizing with her, though. For example, if the restaurant is annoyingly busy, express your solidarity, i.e. “It sure is busy tonight. They should really give you more help with the tables.”

, Your waitress knows the menu like the back of her hand. She knows what’s good, what’s so-so, and what ends up in the garbage. Ask her for recommendations. She’ll notice and point you toward a good meal. It shows a level of trust and turns the conversation to her.Conversely, don’t order something that is not on the menu or ask her to make substitutions. This makes her job harder and will only serve as an annoyance.

, She has been talking about food the whole day. Turn the conversation to something more interesting, whether about you or her. Try to make yourself seem genuinely interesting.No long conversations about who the restaurant’s beef supplier is, or how much they pay for vodka wholesale.
Talk about yourself a bit, or at least hint at it. Waitresses are hit on a lot, and while they're always friendly about it, they probably will turn you down if they don't know you well.
At the same time, turn the conversation to her. Talking only about yourself might come off as self-absorbed. Empathic people ask questions and listen to others., Keep in mind that tips make up about 85% of a waitress’ total wages. Tipping is not just polite, but says that you are well-mannered as well as confident, friendly, and interested.


Tip what you can afford, but don’t be stingy. You will leave a better impression if you err on the side of generosity.
You may remember when 15% was pretty standard for good service. Those days are long gone. Nowadays the standard tip is closer to 20%.Aim for 20% or even 25% for the best effect.

, Remember that your waitress is working and earning a living. She has other tables to serve and other demands on her time. If you try to get her attention too often, she’ll quickly get annoyed.


Remember that she may be very busy. It might even be kind to acknowledge it, i.e. “I don’t want to keep you here talking too long. I can see that you have a lot of work to do!”
Keep in mind as well that, if you monopolize her time, she might get in trouble with her employers.

, Nothing – but nothing – will doom your efforts to catch your waitress’ fancy than suggestive or crude overtures. Remember to put your best foot forward and be polite, ever the gentleman. You are in a restaurant, not a night club or frat house.It is never OK to touch or make unwanted advances. This applies not just to your waitress but any woman. No sexual comments, gestures, or banter.
Alcohol may lower your inhibitions and lead you to say things you’ll regret. Be careful not to carry on your flirting if you’ve been drinking too much.
As in all social situations, if she asks you to stop something, stop it.

, Your first thought might be that the waitress will have more time and be more open to accepting a date if you wait until she stops working. This first thought is wrong. Instead, it looks creepy. Know when to pick your spot and leave.Very probably your waitress doesn’t want to join you for a drink or coffee immediately after her shift. More likely she wants to go home. You’d be better served by deciding to ask her, making your play, and getting on with your night.
If the waitress thinks that you are interested, your sticking around for hours will become a major distraction and annoyance to her.

, If you have struck up an interesting conversation with your waitress and feel a bond, you needn’t act on your first impulse. Take your time. Try stopping in once in a while if the restaurant is conveniently located.


Build up a mutual recognition. It may be a good sign if she notices when you stop in or says hello.
While being a regular is OK, avoid frequenting the restaurant too often lest you seem like a stalker. If you always eat at the same table and always smile at her, she may be creeped out.

, Using the techniques we’ve discussed, try to get to know the waitress a bit. Talk over the course of several meals or drinks, if possible, and learn about her while subtly introducing yourself. This way your request for a date will not seem like it’s coming from a complete stranger.


Try to sit at one of the tables she is serving. Take note of any giveaways that she is unavailable, like a ring on her left hand.

, One way to ask her out without the embarrassment of a possible rejection is to leave a note on one side of a napkin. After paying, jot down your name and number and then leave. If she’s interested, she’ll respond. Notes also leave the matter entirely in her hand and spares her from feeling pressure or having to make a hasty decision.


Be short and to the point, i.e. “You seem like a thoughtful person that I’d interested to know better. Coffee sometime?” End with your name and number.
Insert a nice tip into the fold of a napkin, with the money is sticking out. Make sure that she will notice the tip or someone else could pick it up
Use a clean napkin if you decide on this route.

, In this variant, leave your note inside of the check presenter with your payment and tip. Go with the same approach, including a short offer to take her out and your name and number. Don’t stick around, as it will only make her uncomfortable.


Unlike a napkin, the check presenter should be fairly secure and discreet. In many restaurants, there is an unspoken rule that servers only touch check presenters from their table.If there is room, write the message directly onto the receipt. If not, use a napkin in a pinch.
Aim for a kind and no-pressure request, i.e. “To my charming waitress: pardon my forwardness, but I’d love to take you out. (Insert phone number). Call me sometime. I’d love to hear from you., This gambit involves your passing the note to the waitress directly as you leave the restaurant. Bold, but sure to get her attention. Tuck your tip inside of folded piece of paper with your note.


Write something like, “(Your name and number) Dinner sometime? Call me anytime. I’d love to hear from you!”
Hand her the note as you walk to the door, saying, “This is for you.”

, Your move may well not work out. Your waitress might have just been friendly, or perhaps she is married or involved with someone else. In any case, do not push it any further. Accept the rejection and move on.


The beauty of the note request is its discreetness and also lack of pressure. If you asked her out on a note, you’ll know she is interested or not by her response. The ball is in her court.
Don’t be discouraged if you’ve tried all of the above and she doesn’t call. At least you tried – many men would not!

, If you feel like flirting is not your strongest point, don't sweat it. Just make sure she at least has a chance to realize that you might be interested in her before you ask her out. It is a big thing to have someone ask you out, but if you have no idea they like you it is even more of a surprise. Even paying special attention and talking to her more can introduce the idea to her. A lot of girls are really shy and they sometimes will never tell you if they like you. So sometimes, you have to be the one to approach them.

, Over the phone is good, but avoid e-mail or text messaging, which are too impersonal. Casual is the best way to go. Saying, ""Hey, want to do something later?"" is far better than detailing what you have carefully planned out.

, Unless the girl avoids you, she probably doesn't mind you, even if she doesn't outright like you. Girls are taught in society to be nice. If she says something like, ""Oh, I'm really sorry, I was going out with friends that night,"" don't be put off. Ask only once again. If she gives another excuse, ask if she can make it another time; if she can't, she isn't interested.


Even if you are not confident, act like you are. Girls love suave guys. Don't whip out a, ""Hey Sexy, I'd love to get dinner with you this Friday,"" but be confident in yourself. Nervous guys aren't cool. If you are nervous and think it is a good idea (you are the best judge of the situation), tell her that you're a little bit nervous.

, It almost always makes her nervous. A lot of girls will think you're pretty cool for being able to speak to them in private, by yourself.

, It will make you nervous. Get her by herself. Enlist your friends to distract her group, or find out a time when she is alone.

, That's all you have to do. Just jump into it. If you like a girl and she may like you back just ask her. If you hesitate you may never build up enough confidence again. You'll never know if you don't try.

, It is okay to say you're nervous, but don't say anything too strong, like, ""I'm so nervous because no girl so pretty has gone out with me before. It will make her feel weird. Coming on too strong on the first date is a big no-no. Even if she likes you, she'll feel slightly freaked out.

If the person appears uncomfortable at the mention of the dance, you have the choice of either stopping or continuing on with this. Remember that the situation could go either way.
If the person has already asked someone out to the dance, don't feel disappointed. Be cool about it and say, ""Oh, well that's nice. I hope you two have a fun time!"" From there, you have the choice of either pursuing someone else or not going to the dance at all.

If you choose to pursue someone else, beware that you might hurt the first person's feelings, and you could bring down your reputation.

Ask her out in person, if you can.,
Pick the right time and place to ask her out.,
Call her with confidence.,
Text concisely.,
Avoid being vague about when and where you’ll go out or meet.,
Treat her with respect.,
Avoid looking like a stalker, and know when to give up.,
Be honest about your feelings.,
Make sure you have positive body language.,
Have good hygiene.,
Exude confidence.,
Act naturally and don't make a big deal out of asking her out.,
Resist the temptation to propose a grandiose first date.",How to Ask a Woman on a Date without Making Common Mistakes," Asking her out in person is key to successfully getting a date. Although you may be shy or intimidated, you can’t let those feelings rule you. A date is a potentially intimate moment when two people get to know each other a little better. You should start it off that way., If you’re going to ask her out in person, pick the right time and place. Picking the right time and place to ask her out is one of the most important things in getting a date. You don't want to ask at the wrong time or place, or you might blow your chance. There are a number of things you should consider when asking her out in person:


Don’t pick a time or place where she is distracted.
If you’re in a bar or club with friends, try to find a moment when you're alone. Otherwise, some of your or her friends might invite themselves and make it a group date.
Don’t ask too early in your encounter. Ask toward the end of your encounter when you think you will part ways. Otherwise, you might seem too desperate., Perhaps you got her phone number at a club, and want to contact her the day after and set up a date. This is alright, but make sure your phone call and texting is confident and pleasant. You’ve done the hard work of making first contact and getting her number, don’t blow it now.


Start off the conversation in a light way. Joke about something (appropriate). Try to get her laughing or relaxed.
Demonstrate your interest by asking her questions, but nothing too prying. Focus on light things.
Invite her out. Tell her you’d like to get to know her better. Based on personality, you can ask her to suggest something, or you can suggest something you think she likes.
If she declines, she might tell you why. If it’s a scheduling issue, ask her when a good time is for her. If not, drop it and politely end the conversation – unless you want to pursue a friendship.
If she accepts, try to end the conversation politely., Texting might be a way to follow up with her after you met the night before. It is a noncommittal way to communicate that many people are comfortable with. However, there are a number of things you can do wrong that will blow your shot at getting a date.


Consider texting her the afternoon after you met her. By avoiding an immediate text, you're showing that you're thinking about her, but you're not obsessing.
Start off with a light or humorous comment that will relax her and remind her of who you are. For example: ""Hey! Remember that devastatingly handsome guy you met last night?""
Don’t write a long message to her.
Instead, be clear, concise, and articulate what you want – a date with her. For example: ""I'd like to take you out so we can get to know each other better.""
Don’t be forceful. Avoid telling her what she should do or what she'll be missing if she does not go out with you.
Allow her time to respond. Don’t jump the gun if she doesn’t text back in 3 minutes and then shoot her another text. Wait a few hours or more. Chances are, if she wants to go out with you, she’ll respond., The last thing she wants is to date a guy who is wishy-washy about what he wants. Be clear about when and where you will meet. Feel free to ask her opinion, but if she defers to you, don’t defer to her again. Pick where and when you want to go, and set the date.


Set a specific time.
Set a specific place.
Let her know where you'll be going and what you'll be doing so she'll be prepared., Make sure that any interactions you have with her are respectful and not overbearing. Don't assume that women want to be the lesser party in the relationship and always defer to your judgement. Rather, assume that your relationship, if it goes forward, will be one of equals and one based on mutual respect.


Never insult her or be rude to her.
Always consider her opinion and taste.
Don't make assumptions about her before you get to know her., Even though you're really into her, you've got to avoid looking like a stalking. Don't obsess, and if you do, try to control it. If she's interested in you, she'll let you know. If she turns you down, then call it quits.


If she rejects you, don't try to read in between the lines and interpret it as her playing ""hard to get.""
If she rejects you, don't go out of your way to ""bump"" into her randomly.
If she rejects you, don't be rude. Just move on.
Once she has ended communication with you, it's over.

, Don’t sell yourself as a “friend.” When asking her out, don’t approach her as if it is two friends doing something fun. If you want to date her in a romantic way, be clear about that. If you're not clear, your simply luring her into a friendship with ulterior motives. This is something that will ultimately frustrate both of you., When asking her out, the tone and language of your body should match up with your words. You want her to get the sense from how you’re carrying yourself that you are confident and want to get to know her a little better. Make sure you’re standing up straight, smiling, your shoulders are up, and your hands and arms are in a relaxed and non-defensive posture. There are several things you should avoid:


Slouching over.
Crossing your arms. This demonstrates that you’re in a defensive posture.
Fidgeting with your hands. Don’t play with things in your hands, and don’t keep your hands in your pockets., In order to give her a good impression about who you are, you've got to maintain good hygiene and look well-kept. If you typically don't maintain good hygiene, now is the time to step it up. There are a number of things you need to do:


Shave or groom your beard.
Shower before a date.
Use deodorant and cologne, if you want.
Floss and brush your teeth.
Wash your clothes and only wear clean clothes., When you ask her out, you need to make sure you seem ultra confident and sure of yourself. Try to think positively and focus on all of your good qualities in your own mind. There are pitfalls to this, though. Consider:


You don’t want to come off as arrogant or full of yourself.
You don’t want her to think that you think you’re too good for her.
You don’t want to alienate her or her friends by bragging or boasting about yourself. , Don't make it sound like asking her out is a matter of life and death. Avoid inserting a sense of urgency into the situation. Instead, act nonchalant, but interested. If you are tense and nervous when asking her out, she will feel just as tense and nervous. Make your invitation sound as if it was the most natural thing for you to do (and it should), and this will help her feel comfortable and at ease with the plan as well.

, Proposing a grandiose date might give the wrong impression about who you are. While your first date should be memorable, you don’t want it to be the sort of thing that could intimidate her or could signal to her that you’re jumping the gun on a relationship that does not even exist yet. The purpose of the first date is to spend time together and focus on each other rather than some very interesting activity that would distract you from each other. Avoid:


Anything that requires traveling more than a half hour from your home city. You both should feel at ease and at home wherever it is.
Events like concerts or music festivals. Such events will undermine the ability for both of you to communicate and form a bond.
Events that the other person might not be interested in. Don’t propose a date to an exhibition on modern art unless you know that she’s also passionate about it."
"
Introduce yourself.,
Strike up a conversation.,
Engage in group activities with her.,
Chat with her on Facebook or by texting.,
Make sure she's single.,
Be confident.,
Try to get her alone.,
Have a date in mind.,
Be mindful of your maturity difference.,
Be yourself.,
Be prepared for rejection.",How to Ask Out an Older Girl in High School," No matter what your age is compared to hers, most girls don’t respond well to being asked out by someone they don’t know. Allowing her the chance to even know you exist will make asking her out much easier.


It’s as simple as walking up and saying hello. Most girls respond well to confidence.Although it’s completely natural to be nervous, try your best to be calm and confident. After all, you’re just saying hi.
If you have a mutual friend, ask that person to introduce you. This may lessen that awkward factor.;
, Hopefully, you are planning on asking this girl out because there’s something you like about her. Use this as a conversation topic. For example, talk about your mutual friend, the football game, or how you enjoyed watching her play soccer.


""I saw you at the football game on Saturday. Did you see that cat run across the field in the middle of the play?""
""Have you seen that new movie yet? I hear it's supposed to be hilarious."" If she hasn't seen it, this would be a great opportunity to suggest you see it together.
""I saw a picture of you from homecoming on Facebook. Did you really get a limo?""
""Sara told me that you are in drama club. I was thinking about joining too. Do you like the advisor?""

, This may be difficult if your circle of friends doesn’t intersect with hers, which is likely if she is much older than you. Becoming friends with someone is an easy first step in getting to know someone and letting them get to know you.


Ask her to go to a group movie date or other group event. For example, ""A bunch of us are going out to the lake on Saturday. You should join us if you're not busy.""
Ask her if she’s planning on being at the football game. If so, casually mention that you’ll see her there.

, This is a simple way to get to know someone better, while giving you the time and space to respond. This is especially helpful if you get nervous easily and aren’t quite sure what to say. This is also a great opportunity to gauge her interest.


If her responses are short or if she only responds after you've sent her several messages, she may not be that interested. If she gives you full responses and furthers the conversation, this is a good sign.
For example, if you ask her what she thought about the new Superman movie, and she replies with something short and nondescript, like ""good"" or ""I liked it,"" she may not be that interested. If however, she replies more in depth or asks your thoughts, she may be more interested in chatting with you.

, This may seem like a no-brainer, but ensuring she's actually available will save you from having to endure the embarrassing mistake of asking out a girl who's taken.


Ask around, but be causal about it. You don't want to spread the word that you're trying to figure out if she's dating anyone.
Check Facebook. It may be harder to determine if she's single if she's dating someone who's not in your school, but social media is a good place to start.

, After all, you’re asking out an older girl. No matter their age, girls are usually attracted to confident guys. Although awkwardness can be endearing sometimes, it might come off as immaturity when asking out an older girl.


Stand up tall.
Walk with purpose.
Don’t stare at the floor. Make eye contact with her.
Use this guide to help you appear more confident. , This may be difficult to do at school, as girls tend to hang out in groups. If she is with a group of her friends, she may feel pressure to say no to your date because she’s afraid of what her friends will think. Being able to text her may be helpful in this case.

, Girls are more apt to go on a date with you if you actually suggest an activity rather than just asking if they will go out with you. Asking a girl to “go out with you” sounds more like you’re proposing to be boyfriend/girlfriend. She may not be ready for this before going on a couple dates with you.


Suggest a fun activity for you to do together. This could be going to a movie, dinner, ice skating, concert, or athletic match together.
Know her interests. Suggesting an activity that you know she enjoys will make it more likely that she’ll want to go on that date with you. For example, if you ask her to go to a country concert with you, but she hates country music, she may say no for that reason and not because she doesn’t like you.

, Typically, girls mature faster than guys, which puts younger guys at a disadvantage in dating older girls.This can potentially result in an even greater difference in maturity levels. Be aware of any differences in maturity and act accordingly.


Try to emulate her behavior in situations that you are unfamiliar with. For example, when hanging out with her older friends, don't try to be the center of attention. Sit back and observe how her older group of friends interacts before jumping in.
Try not to draw too much attention to your age difference. She may have a later curfew than you or none at all, while you are still expected to be home early. Simply make plans for earlier in the evening rather than having to cut activities short because you have to be home early.

, Trying to act like someone you're not will only work for so long and she will eventually see through it. She may love the fact that you're younger and possibly have dated fewer people than she has.


Dating an older girl may mean dating someone with more experience than you. Don't feel pressured to do anything you aren't ready for. Be honest with her and communicate that you want to take things slow. If she really cares about you, she will understand.

, Just because a girl says no to a date with you doesn’t mean that she doesn’t want to be your friend. Maybe she just hasn’t realized that she likes you yet. Give her time to get to know you better if she says she just wants to be friends and maybe she will change her mind later. In the meantime, don’t continue to pressure her to date you as it may drive her further away.

Choose a semi-busy, casual setting to ask the question.,
Have an event or activity in mind before asking.,
Keep the conversation light and friendly, not serious or romantic.,
Be upfront about you desire not to date.,
Offer for her to bring some friends along too.",How to Ask a Girl Out Platonically1," Again, the best tip is to not take things so seriously, so don't bother to wait until you're alone to ask -- this just makes it feel more like a date. Instead, pop the question in the hall, during lunch, or in the break room. If other people are around, and you don't seem like you're asking a super important question, she'll get the hint that it is platonic.


If you're in a group, invite her out with everyone else. Having a large group of friends together will make the date obviously platonic.;
, Simply asking, ""do you want to hang out,"" without having an idea where will just lead to awkwardness. Furthermore, having something already in mind makes it easier to just be casual about it -- ""hey, want to see that concert we talked about this weekend.""


In general, don't invite her out to dinner. This is almost always ""date"" territory.
Any activity with lots of people (mini-golf, museum tours, etc.), or common hobbies you share (biking, rock climbing, playing music, etc.) are fantastic platonic options.

, The best way to accomplish this is to not think about it for too long. Just go ahead and ask, keeping it light and fun. The best way to do this is to simply ask her when you think of the activity instead of planning out the perfect worlds. Remember -- if you want the date to be purely friendly, you need to treat her like a friend. So stop worrying too much about the words and just chat., It may seem a little strange or abrupt at first, but everyone will be much happier and more relaxed if you don't have to guess whether or not you're dating. Simply open up with an open, honest desire to get to know her as a friend:


""Hey, I don't want you to think I'm hitting on you, but -- ""
""You seem like a really cool person, and I'd love to hang out as friends sometimes?""
""I'm new here, and am looking to meet some new friends. Let's be friends!""

, This is a clear, considerate way to indicate you're not looking for romance. When you ask her out on the platonic date, tell her to let her friends know as well. The cliche, ""the more the merrier,"" isn't exactly romantic, but that's the point. Asking her to group events will be much easier.

"
"
Watch your body language.,
Let her pay for her own things.,
Act like friends, and don't treat her any more special than anyone else.,
Mention your significant other, if you have one, to show you're not interested in dating.,
Keep your plans loose.",How to Ask a Girl Out Platonically2," Some joking poking and prodding, a light hug, and sitting next to each other is fine, but brushing her shoulders or cheeks, snuggling up next to each other, and (of course!) kissing are going to send a very different message. The best ground rule is to act like you were with any other friend, of any gender. Don't overanalyze every gesture or move -- that's what people do on dates! Just be yourself.


Try not to touch each other much -- especially if you construe it at all as sexual. If you feel like things are romantic, they are, so move on or find a way to create some distance., If one of you is buying the other's dinner or the movie tickets, you're starting to steer yourself into dating territory. Let her buy her food, and you buy yours. Remember, going out platonically is just like going out with friends -- and you wouldn't buy your buddy's taxi ride just for nothing.

, If you're your normal, friendly self, then you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Whenever you're together, try not to overthink things or worry about signals. Just relax and be a friend, like you would with any of ""the guys."" The more you keep things friendly in general, the more platonic you'll come off when you ask her out.


You shouldn't treat her like ""girlfriend-lite."" You want to treat her like a normal friend whose opinion you admire and who you like spending time with.

, One of the best ways to make it obvious that the date is platonic is to talk about the person you're actually dating. Even if you're not currently seeing anyone, you may feel comfortable enough to mention that you're not interested in dating, though you have to see how to conversation plays out. Some ways to be subtle include:


""You like that band? My girlfriend loves them too!""
""You would get along great with _______, I'd love you to meet her.""
You should also ask about her love life -- asking ""who are you crushing on?"" or ""any luck finding a new man?"" will show that you're just friend's gossiping., If you run into other friends, go join them. If she suggests something different to do, or you change your mind, go with the flow. Don't worry about keeping things perfect or ""running"" the date well. This is just two friends hanging out, and overthinking things tends to give the impression of a ""real"" date.


Do not invite her back to your place, especially if you're just getting to know one another.

"
"
Determine where you stand on a potential romantic relationship.,
Maintain your boundaries.,
Hang out in groups, not just one on one.,
Know that the occasional temptation doesn't mean you can't be friends anymore.",How to Ask a Girl Out Platonically3," Do you want to get to know her better in the hopes of dating down the line, or do you want to keep things firmly friendly? Both are perfectly fine, but you should take some time to think about this, especially if she seems to be developing feelings or wanting more. Be honest with yourself, and what you want, and it will be much easier to handle and changing feelings.

, There comes a point where, unless you're looking to move forward into romance, you're just going to have to hang out with other people. This line is different for everyone, and a lot depends on your personal boundaries. That said, some good ground rules include:



No sexual contact of any kind, including kissing. This is especially important when drinking, as the ""friendly hook-up"" sounds like a much better idea than it is.

See other people of both genders. A large, varied friend group can keep you from becoming too dependent on each other.

Be honest, especially if one of you develops feelings. Holding and hiding things tends to let the feelings balloon up and grow until they are much harder to manage., Romantic dates are almost strictly two people affairs, but platonic friends tend to hang out in groups. This doesn't mean you can't ask a girl out platonically by herself. Rather, you should feel comfortable hanging out with others as well, sending the message that you're interested as friends, not as partners.


Inviting her to group events shows that she is part of the gang -- a valued friend instead of a special someone.

, By definition, platonic friends are those that could have a sexual relationship but don't. So it is only natural that you'll occasionally feel a spark of something more, even if you don't want to pursue it. This is fine, as long as you stay honest with yourself.


Always ask, ""is giving in to this temptation worth potentially losing my friendship?""If you feel her getting interested, or flirting, don't flirt back. You don't have to say anything about it, but you shouldn't condone the behavior unless you want to send mixed signals.

"
"
Smile and make eye contact.,
Engage in a little small talk.,
Ask if the person is in a relationship.,
Get a phone number or arrange a date.",How to Ask a Person if They're Single1," Doing some simple flirting is a good way to determine if someone is interested in you and it may also help you to determine if the person is single or not. If you flash a smile at someone and the person returns it, then this is a good sign.If you are standing across the room, try by making eye contact and smiling at the person. Doing this will send him or her the message that you would like to talk. If the person returns your gaze and smiles back, then you should approach him or her.
If the person looks away or does not return your smile, then he or she may not be interested.;
, Some people find small talk annoying, but keep in mind that it can help you to find out if someone is single and may even lead to a deeper discussion later on.After you approach someone, introduce yourself and strike up a conversation. Chatting with the person for a few minutes before you ask if he or she is single will give you a chance to learn a bit more about the person and decide if he or she is someone you’d like to date. Try chatting about:


The place you are at. For example, you could say something like, “This place has the best coffee! What are you drinking?”
The people you are with. For example, you could say something like, “That’s my friend George over there. Did you bring anyone?”
A recent event. For example, you could say something like, “Did you catch the game last night?”

, When you feel like you’ve made a connection with the person you like, then you can ask if the person is in in a relationship. Make your question as direct as possible to avoid any confusion.


Try saying something like, “Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?” or “Are you seeing anyone?”
If he or she says ""yes,"" try not to show your disappointment. Just say something like, “That’s cool,” and then talk for a little longer before excusing yourself.
If the person says ""no,"" don’t react with too much excitement. You might just say something like, “Cool. I’m not either.”

, If this person is single and seems to be enjoying your company, then you can get his or her phone number and/or set up a date. There are many ways to ask someone out, but a simple approach might be best.


Try saying something like, “I am enjoying talking with you. Would you like to get together for dinner sometime?” Or, ""We should talk again sometime. Can I get your phone number?"" Or, ""I'm going for a hike on Saturday. Want to come along?""
If the person rejects your invitation, then try not to get discouraged. It is possible that the person recently go out of a relationship and is not ready to date yet.

"
"
Pay attention to body language.,
Check for a ring.A wedding or engagement ring is a dead giveaway that someone is taken.,
Introduce yourself.,
Get to know the person.,
Ask about weekend plans.",How to Ask a Person if They're Single2," Noting the way that the person interacts with someone else can also help you to determine if he or she is taken. If this person is with a person or group of people, then pay attention to how he or she interacts with them. Try to glance at the person now and then to see how he or she is behaving.


For example, is the person leaning in towards someone and smiling?Is the person standing closer to someone than is appropriate for friends? Is the person holding hands with anyone or touching someone on the arm or back? These things may indicate that the person is not single.
However, if the person is not displaying any intimate body language with anyone, then there is a good chance that he or she is single.

, If you are close enough to see the person’s hands, then look for a ring on the person’s left hand. People usually wear wedding and/or engagement rings on the ring finger, which is the one next to the pinky finger.


If there is no ring, then there is a chance that this person is single. However, keep in mind that many people have committed relationships without being married.

, If you have reason to believe that the person is single, then you can introduce yourself and start to get to know the person you like. Just keep in mind that taking this approach may reveal that the person is or is not single within your first conversation, or it might take a while.


If the person is alone, try saying something like, “Hi. I’m __. What’s your name?”
If the person you’re interested in is in a large group, then you can introduce yourself to the whole group by saying something like: “Hi, I’m __. How does everybody here know each other?”

, When you first meet someone, it is good to ask questions to get to know the person better. Allowing the person a chance to talk may also reveal whether or not he or she is seeing anyone. Some good getting-to-know-you questions include:Where did you grow up?
Where do you work? Do you like it?
Do you have any pets?
What do you like to do in your spare time?

, If the person is not single, then he or she likely has plans with a significant other over the weekend. You can casually ask about the person’s weekend plans and this may give you an answer to your question and it can also be a good way to ask for a date.Try saying something like, “What do you have planned for this weekend?”
If the person says nothing, then you can try saying something like, “I was thinking of going to see a movie. Would you be into that?”
If the person says that he or she has plans with a significant other, then just play it cool. Try saying something, “Awesome! Have a great time!”

React well if they say they don’t return your feelings.,
Give it time.",How to Admit You Like Someone," When you tell someone how you feel, it is important to show confidence. If you are timid and unsure, how will that make your crush feel? He or she will not want to be with someone who seems unsure.Smiling is one of the easiest ways to broadcast confidence. A relaxed, natural smile shows others that you are sure of yourself and will impress them.;
, Don't panic when you admit your feelings. This can be a very stressful situation and it is easy to lose your cool, but you must remain calm during the whole conversation. If you panic and seem nervous, it will not help your case at all.If you start to feel like you are panicking, try focusing on your breathing. Take deep breaths and calm down. Or pretend like you are talking to an old friend, not someone you like. This will make it easier to talk to them.

, Let them know how you feel about them, but do not go over the top and act like they are the most important thing in the world. Let them know what is going on and why is it that you feel that way about them. Avoid discussing any huge relationship commitments, as it may make your partner feel uncomfortable or uneasy.

, Do not just jump into that subject right away. Start off talking about something that happened that day, and work your way up to talking about your feelings. This will give your crush some time so that they won’t be surprised or caught off guard when you tell them how you feel.Try talking about something cute or funny to make you more comfortable with the conversation initially. Tell your crush about a funny thing your brother did or talk about a new movie you really want to see.

, Tell your crush that you like them. Just say it. It might be intimidating, but they’ll never know if you don’t tell them. Be brave and tell them how you feel.


Try something like, “I’ve been thinking about you a lot and I want you to know that I like you.”

, Make sure you tell the person you like that you don’t expect anything in return – you just wanted to tell them how you feel. That way they can have some time to think about what you said without feeling pressured to respond right away.


When you're done expressing yourself don't ask, ""So, how do you feel about me?"" It is up to them when and if they are willing to let you know. If they say no, then accept their answer and move forward. Say how you really feel, but don't throw a tantrum.
If they say they like you too, that’s great. But don’t make them feel like they owe you a response right away.
If they say yes, then you could ask them out. But if you're younger, you should just be friends.

, There are many things that can go wrong when you expose your feelings to another person. So, take some time considering how and when you’ll do it beforehand to minimize these negative possibilities.Choose a time when the person is alone. This is a private matter between the two of you and you should be alone when it happens. You don’t want the object of your affection to have to think about how to react in front of other people in addition to handling the news you just told them.
Consider your crush’s schedule too. Don’t tell them how you feel at a time when they are busy and stressed. This might overwhelm them even more and make them respond in a more negative way than they otherwise would.

, Try to choose an intimate setting, a place where both of you are comfortable. You want your crush to feel at ease when you admit that you like them. Choosing a place that you both enjoy and feel comfortable in can make all the difference in how someone will receive news like this.Try telling them in the peaceful park near your house or when you are both alone in your car.

, If possible, don’t tell them in a text or over the phone. Maintain eye contact while you are talking to him/her and tell them how you feel.Doing it in person is more meaningful, but it will also let you gauge their reaction because you’ll be there to see it.However, if either of you are the nervous type that might stutter or get sweaty, sending a text or writing a note might be a better option. That way you can think about what you want to say before you actually say it. But keep in mind that texting should be used as a last resort to tell someone how you feel.
If you must send a text, try something like, “Hey, I like you. Want to hang out some time?”Don’t ask someone else to tell him or her for you unless you feel it is absolutely necessary because you are too embarrassed or for some other reason. Make sure if you do ask someone else to tell your crush how you feel that it is someone you trust so they won’t spread rumors about you.

, Nothing is guaranteed. It is very possible that the object of your affection won’t return your feelings. But you shouldn’t tell them only to get a positive response. It is nice to know people like you and your crush should appreciate your honesty, regardless of the outcome. If they have nothing to say in response to how you feel, move on and don't be discouraged because of their response., If they do let you know how they feel about you, but it is not the same way you feel about them, don't stress it and don't make the mistake to take it back. Eventually they may feel the same way and if they don't, again just move on.The important thing here is to react with grace. If you get upset or say something mean in response, then it negates all of the nice things you just did and said. And it will definitely eliminate any chance of your crush deciding that they do really like you in the future.
Don’t indulge in a pity party or get visibly upset in front of your crush.

, Sometimes people need time to think about their feelings and make a decision like this. Strong emotions often take time to develop. So it’s possible that they will think about what you said and change their mind in the future.Continue being their friend and try to act as if nothing has changed. This will give them a chance to see you in a new light.

Be presentable when you ask her out.,
Be clear that what you want is a date.,
Ask her on a study date.,
Make a t-shirt for the occasion.,
Find out more about her interests.,
Give her a personalised gift.,
Don’t comment on her body or physical features.,

Look for signals that she likes you.,
Think about what will happen if she says no.",How to Ask a Female Friend out on a Date," It should be when you two are alone and feel comfortable and relaxed. You can slip it into a conversation casually. Suggest playfully that you can be her date for the night and show her what it would be like to date you.


You should ideally ask her out in person, but over the phone is also an acceptable option. Do not ask someone out over e-mail or Facebook.Ask her when you are alone together. She may feel uncomfortable and embarrassed if her friends are around. That may cause her just to say no, regardless of how she feels.;
, If you ask her out on a date in person, take the time to look nice. You don't need to get decked out in a suit and tie, but you shouldn't ask her out in your gym clothes either. You have a better chance at getting a date if you dress up a little.Be well groomed and clean. Smell pleasant, but not overly scented.
Additionally, make sure you brush your teeth and floss before you approach her.

, Whether you propose a trip to the movies or offer to cook her dinner, she might misinterpret your question as just a friendly gesture. Again, make it clear that this is a date.


Try saying something like this: “We should go see a movie together. We could make a date of it!” or “I’d love to take you on a date to the fair this weekend.”
This is clearer than asking her to “hang out.”
She might be worried about your friendship, so tell her that you enjoy being her friend and that you want to stay friends no matter what.

, Study dates are less uncomfortable and a good excuse to get together, especially if she has been dropping hints about failing a subject or just having trouble in class. There is less pressure for it to be a date date and will give you a chance to spend some alone time together.

, Since you are already friends, she already knows and appreciates your sense of humor. Try making a special t-shirt that says something like “Will you go on a date with me? Yes or No.” It will lighten the mood and make her think about how funny you are and how she already likes spending time with you., You have a better chance of scoring a date if you're inviting her to an activity or event that you already know she's interested in. This also shows her that you're interested in her as a person.You already know her well enough to know some of the things she likes. Use this knowledge to your advantage.

, Knowing a girl well before becoming romantically involved means being able to give her something you know she’ll love. Let her know how much you pay attention to her and how invested you are by giving her a thoughtful gift that shows her how you feel.


You might choose some of her favourite songs or include one that lets her know how you feel about her. Burn a copy of the playlist on a CD for her or send her a link to it. It's an inexpensive and easy way to let her know that you care.Some good songs to include might be “Just the Way You Are” by Bruno Mars, “Your Love is My Drug” by Kesha, or “I’m Yours” by Jason Mraz., If your female friend doesn’t return your sentiment, it will be harder to come back from this and continue to be friends if she thinks you are always thinking about her sexually. Instead, talk to her about the deeper things you know and love about her.This is where you have a leg up on other people anyways. You already know things about her because you are friends. Whereas other potential love interests might have to resort to complimenting something physically obvious like her looks, you can bring up things that take time to learn about a person – like how you love that she volunteers at the animal shelter or that she cries when she watches sad movies.

, Think about all possible outcomes and weigh the pros and cons. You can even make a pros/cons list if it helps you to visualize the situation more completely. Since this girl is your friend, you need to make this decision carefully.You already know that you get along and that you like her personality. You already know what she likes and how to please her. You’ve likely already met her family (an often intimidating part of dating a new person).
But you also have a lot to lose. You’re not just risking rejection by some girl you just met. You’re also possibly jeopardizing one of the most important people in your life.
Ultimately, the decision is up to you. If you feel like you couldn’t handle it if she rejects you, it might be better to wait and see if things develop naturally on their own. But if you think you will be miserable every day while you are hiding these feelings for her, it might be better to ask her out.

, Learn to read her body language. Is her affection towards you like that of a sibling, or is it potentially romantic? Does she flirt only with you or does she flirt with everybody? Is she interested in another person?


Think about the time of day that she normally hangs out with you. If you usually spend time together during the day (lunches, casual hang out sessions, etc.), she might be less likely to return your feelings. But if you hang out in the evenings or on weekends, that’s a good sign., You might decide that you would be able to continue being friends with her if she is not interested in dating you, but consider what you know about her as a person and whether you think she would feel too awkward moving forward as friends. If she is a naturally shy person, it might be difficult for her to continue being friends.

It's important to respect her individuality and get to know her better, and to give her the chance to get to know you too.


Find a shared activity, like a sport, hobby, club, or even just chatting during lunch so that you can be around one another long enough to get to know her personally. Try walking with her to class or dropping by her work. The more time you spend with her, the more you'll get to know her personality quirks and how she expresses herself, and the easier it will be to tell if she really likes you.;
, Subtle changes in her personality might indicate interest in you, while other changes might show that she is just not that into you.


It is important that you get to know her personality by watching how she interacts with her friends, or else you will not be able to notice any subtle variations when you're around.
A girl who is interested might be bubblier when you're around (or even if you're within earshot), laughing more and being more boisterous to impress you. Some girls, though, might be quieter around someone they like, and may go red in the face or look down and avoid eye contact.
Some signs that a girl is most likely not interested in you include stiffening her body or moving away from you; giving short, gruff answers to your questions or making sarcastic replies to your comments; acting annoyed if you interrupt her time with friends; rolling her eyes or scowling; or directing her attention to others, especially other people she may be romantically interested in.
You can also try to notice how she interacts with her friends of both genders when you are around. Does she laugh at everyone's jokes the same, touch everyone casually when they talk, look into everyone's eyes intently, or does she reserve these signs of interest for you alone?

, Sit down next to her at lunch or during an activity totally out of the blue. This will mean that she doesn't have the time to prepare herself to meet you and her flustered responses will tell you a lot about her feelings for you.


A girl who is caught off guard by someone she is not interested in will probably not change how she's behaving (unless she actually dislikes you, in which case she might seem annoyed, rigid, or distracted); she would see you as just another friend dropping in to say hi. However, if she is interested in you, she might suddenly seem shy or embarrassed, or she might reach up to run her hands through her hair or adjust her clothes to make sure she looks her best.
Be sure you don't catch her in a bad moment, like if she's checking to see if there's something in her teeth or really wrapped up in a conversation with one of her friends. She might be embarrassed if you catch her too off-guard, which might backfire on you.

, Go up to her when her friends are all around her. If they suddenly disperse to leave the two of you alone together, it could mean she has already told them she likes you and has asked them to scram should you come along.


Notice how her friends react when you walk by: Do they giggle, whisper to each other, or give you a knowing smile? If so, that's another sign she might like you.

, When you talk to her one-on-one, does she keep checking her phone, looking around for someone else to talk to, or shifting her weight like she's looking for an excuse to leave? If so, she's not that into you.


But if she leans in, laughs a lot, and seems to just like being in your orbit, then chances are that she's doing this because she likes being around you.

, If he is not just a part of her group of friends, her reaction might tell you whether she is interested in you (or in him!).


If she appears flustered, uncomfortable, or looks down, this may be a sign that she's worried you will think she likes this guy over you. If she does not respond to you because she's so wrapped up in conversation with him, or if she waves to you vaguely and quickly shifts her focus back to him, this might indicate that she's not that interested into you.
When you talk to her with a group of friends around, see if she looks to you for your reaction, especially if there are other guys present. This can be a sign that she cares more about how you react than about the other people she's talking to.
She may be more shy around you than she is around guys she considers to be ""just friends,"" so try not to read too much into her behavior with guy friends.

, While there are lots of common signals that girls send to let others know they are interested, not all girls work the same way-- they are individuals! A girl could be very shy or very confident, and either personality might express interest in very different ways.


Just like you don't always know if a girl is interested (you're reading this article after all!), a girl might not always know how to show her interest. She may send mixed signals, or come across as aloof or disinterested because she's not sure how to best convey her feelings (or, if she's not sure about you as a potential date, she might not be certain she wants you to know about her feelings for you in the first place).

, While some girls will be clearly interested in you and some won't, others might waver between interest and disinterest. These girls might string you along one day and the next day treat you completely differently. This is different from a girl who is just unsure about how to express her feelings; this is a girl who is actively trying to lead you on or take advantage of you.


Waiting for someone like this for too long will only cause you pain and will make you lose time that could have been used to find someone that actually likes you. If a girl you like does not seem to know what she wants, give her space and time, and move on if she does not seem to make up her mind.

, Even if she's shy, try to draw her out by asking her about her own interests. If she seems comfortable talking about herself and sharing her interests and points of view with you, this might indicate that she is keen on you.


Keep in mind that a lot of girls feel pressure to tone down their opinions to impress guys, so she might be hesitant to really express herself if you try to get her to talk about things she is passionate about or that are very controversial. Start with casual topics like classes at school, shared hobbies or clubs, or friends you have in common before you broach more serious topics like politics or religion. Help her feel comfortable sharing her opinions by encouraging her to say what she really thinks and not becoming defensive if she disagrees with your opinion.

, If a girl is interested in you, some of the things she says will start to give away her interest. For example, she might suddenly start to call you by a pet name and start complimenting you. Other verbal signs of interest in you include giggling, laughing at your jokes even if they're pretty lame, and asking for your help.


See if she's trying to be coy or playful or just telling you something that you think is calculated to make you like her. If she burps in front of you, confesses something embarrassing, or tells you about a guy she has a crush on, then she probably sees you as a friend.
Does she talk to you more than she talks to other people (anybody not obviously a friend)? If she's usually not extremely talkative or typically waits for someone else to start a conversation, but talks to you frequently, this could be a good sign that she is very comfortable with you.

, Sincere compliments indicate that she at least likes you as a person, if not more, which is a great place to start. She may also be using the compliment as an excuse to talk to you more, which is also a sign that she might like you.


For example, if she compliments you on a shot or kick you made or asks you why you didn't play, it shows that she has been paying as much attention to you as the game itself.
If she compliments something you did when it really wasn't all that great, then there's even more of a chance that she's into you.

, If a girl just nods vaguely or seems distracted when you try to talk to her, then she may be getting bored or be ready to leave. But if she asks you lots of questions, whether she's asking about you or the thing you're talking about, or brings up a completely unrelated topic, then she may be trying to prolong the conversation because she likes you.


It's also a good sign if she asks you a question she could easily find the answer to herself; it means she's using the question as an excuse to talk to you. If you have a class together, and she asks you for the homework, when she could easily ask one of her friends instead, then it's a great sign that she's just looking for excuses to talk to you.
See if she asks you about your plans; she may be trying to hint that she'd like to come along, or find out if you're hanging out with other girls.
Does she ask you about other girls? If she asks you if you have a girlfriend or if you like anyone, this can be tricky: she might be interested in you, or she might be asking for a friend. You might answer coyly (letting her know you do like someone but won't name any names), or you might be honest and say you're interested in her. The other option is to casually turn the question back on her and ask if she's interested in anyone rather than answering her outright.

, Crack a joke. It doesn't matter how bad it is; if she's interested in you, she'll laugh. If she's not into you, you'll get such responses as a steely look and no laugh at all, a pitying smile, or a condescending comment.


Girls tend to laugh more at the jokes of people they like, even if they're not all that funny. But avoid offending her or ruining your rapport by being careful to avoid telling jokes that are sexist (or sexual), racist, or otherwise potentially offensive in any way, including jokes at her or another person's expense.

, When she's around you, a girl who is interested will seem to stand taller, pull her shoulders back, and pull her stomach in.You can even try to be slick and check out her posture when she walks away from you, or when she doesn't know you're around.


A girl who is interested might subconsciously send nonverbal cues like licking her lips, touching her neck, or lifting her head so that more of her neck is exposed. In general, girls who are interested tend to sit or stand in ways that accentuate their body and face.She may lean toward you more, or move closer to you. Other signs of interest can be playing with her hair or clothing, using hand gestures, or tilting her head., Some psychologists think that foot movement may be one of the best nonverbal cues to read in order to know if someone is interested in you, since we are the least conscious of what our feet are doing. Check what she does with her feet and legs while sitting, which might indicate her level of interest.Girls who sit with their feet under them or their legs tightly crossed may be showing a lack of interest or some degree of nervousness around you. On the other hand, girls who sit with their feet away from their body and their legs relaxed may be more interested., Casually brush her arm or shoulder in passing, or touch her hand as you reach for something on the table. A girl who likes you will almost definitely notice if you touch her, even in a very casual and platonic way: she may blush, glance at you, or try to make the touch linger. A girl who definitely dislikes you is likely to pull away, avoid your touch, or act as if you have burned her by casually touching her. A girl who sees you as just a friend is likely to not notice your touch at all.


While a casual, glancing touch of her hand or arm can be helpful if you are trying to figure out if she likes you, do not take it any further than that until you know for sure that she is interested and have her consent.
While holding the girl's hand or putting your hands around her waist may seem like a nice thing to do, these more intimate types of touch are best saved for when you know she is interested and comfortable with you touching her. It is very important not to rush things. Do not forcefully take her hand or touch her. If she is showing signs of irritation, immediately stop touching her, or she may think that you are possessive and controlling.

, Look for the blush; that's a fairly good sign that she's into you. If she blushes just from seeing you, being around you, or saying hello to you, then it may be because she's flustered because she likes you.


Be sure that you watch her around other people to see if she's the kind of person who blushes easily.

, If this is the case, then she may have a crush on you. Look into her eyes to see if her pupils get larger without creeping her out. This is a sign that she's excited about being around you.


Of course, if you're in a room and the lights suddenly dim, then her pupils will get larger, too.

, Imitation really is the highest form of flattery — and a sign that she likes you. Watch for her touching you and mirroring your movements. These are signs that she's interested.This is called limbic synchrony, and it’s a subconscious feature of human interaction that signals that we like someone or are in agreement with them. For example, if you have your arms crossed, she may cross her arms, or if you have your hands on your hips, she may do the same., She will start to maintain eye contact and even lock eyes with you once she's interested in you. She will scan your face, do a double-take, and give you a darting glance, then a second look.She may also look doe-eyed or dewy-eyed when she looks at you.


If she looks down at the ground, it may mean that she is shy and nervous to make eye contact.
Take a moment during class, after studies, or whenever she's around to check out where she's looking. If she's watching you or looks at you and then quickly looks away when she spots that you've seen her, you at least know that she's thinking about you. Focusing her view on you is a great sign of interest.

, Is she turning up everywhere you seem to be? Is she showing a sudden interest in things you like but she's not so big on, such as your football games? If she is willing to go out of the way to an event or game she'd normally have nothing to do with, this is a big hint that she's interested in you. It gets even clearer for you if she takes the time to ask you questions about the game or about your involvement in it; that means she's definitely into you.


Maybe you see her suddenly hanging around your group of friends when you never saw her in that circle before. It could be her way of trying to get closer to you.

, Many guys overestimate how interested a girl is because they don't pay attention to what she says and does, but instead jump to conclusions. Girls are socialized to be nice and friendly to everyone, even if they're not interested, and that can lead to a lot of mixed signals from guys who interpret every nice girl as a flirting girl. For example, you might think ""She talked to me! She must like me!"" or ""She smiled at me! She must like me!"" when actually she is just friendly and talks to and smiles at everyone.


Pay careful attention to her and don't jump to conclusions from a few small interactions with her. Get to know her as an individual and give it time over several weeks to really know if she is interested in you or if she's just a friendly person., Sometimes guys mistake a girl's clothing choice as an indication of her interest in him, and that can be very misleading. In particular, some guys assume that a girl who is scantily clad or dressed in a sexual or provocative way must be interested in him. This is a dangerous assumption, since there are a million reasons a girl might be dressed the way she is that have nothing to do with you.


Don't assume that a girl who is dressed in a sexual or provocative way is doing so to entice you or lead you on, or to convey that she is interested in you sexually.While it's true that a girl who is interested in you is likely to try to look her best around you, this has very little to do with how sexy she will try to be. Her body language and facial expression are a better indication of her level of interest than her clothing choice.

, Every time, all the time: if she says no, it means no. Although it's true that some people play games, you can't afford to risk misreading her intention when it comes to her consent. You must choose to be respectful of her if she says no to your advances or to your interest.


If you try to touch her in any way (whether its hand holding, back rubbing, kissing, or anything else) and she says no, stop immediately and don't do it again unless she says it's ok. Listening to her when she says no shows respect for her right to choose. Consent is not just about sex, it's about all forms of intimacy.
If she says she's not interested in you, respect it until she says otherwise. Most often you can still be her friend, but back off if she seems uncomfortable with you or avoids being around you.

, How do you feel when you're around her? Do you feel happy, giddy, and excited? Does she make you feel good about yourself and do you feel like you want to spend more time around her? These are good signs that you're feeling good about her and ready to get to know her better.


The fact that you're reading about how to tell if she's interested is probably already a great sign that you're into her and ready to take this to the next level.

, She may want you to ask her on a date but doesn't want to be too obvious about it. However, there are some tell-tale signs that she wants to take your relationship to the next level.


She may ask what you're doing over the weekend and mention that she's not doing much. When you mention a hobby, she may say she'd like to try it some time. If you mention a movie that's coming out and she blurts out, ""I'd love to see it!"" then she may be opening up a space for you to invite her to go.

, You've had all the indications above, and you've decided the feelings are mutual and you'd really like to take her on a date. The next logical step is to own up to your interest in her and hope that she'll respond in kind.


Pick a place where you won't be interrupted, but be casual about it. Let her know you're interested without putting on too much pressure.
When you ask her on a date, try not to leave it vague whether it’s actually a date or if you're just going as friends. For example, if you say, ""Do you want to catch a movie?"" she won't know if you're asking as her friend or as a potential date. But if you phrase it differently and say, ""I was wondering if you might want to go out sometime? We could catch a movie,"" it will be more clear that you have romantic intentions. Clarity will also help you too: the last thing you want is a girl who doesn't like you in that way to go on a date with you and not realize it until later!

, Sometimes you'll get all the signals because a girl is naturally flirty with everyone. She isn't doing it to be mean; it's just who she is and you'll need to keep looking.


More rarely, if she says no, it could be a sign that she's nervous, confused, or playing hard to get. She could also be having some problems at home or with a parent who won't allow her to date, or she might simply not be ready. If you really like her, you can continue being her friend and try again at a later date when she's had more time to get to know you.

This is also a really good flirting technique. Holding his gaze, especially if the two of you are talking, will create a connection between you two pretty quickly.If a lot of times you look up, and he's looking at you, that's a good sign. It means that he likes looking at you, but he might be too shy to make his interest known or to approach you!;
, Subconsciously, people want to be close to a person that they're interested in. If he's leaning towards you it means that he's comfortable with you and that he wants to be near you. These are very good indicators of his interest.If he moves to get closer to you, this is also a good sign. For example: if the two of you are walking together and his arm keeps brushing up against yours.
This can be a subtle, mostly subconscious movement, or it can be much less subtle. You can use a bit of moving closer of your own to flirt with him. For example, you might walk around a puddle on his side of the puddle so that you get closer to him.

, People tend to subconsciously mirror the body language of people that they like. If he's mirroring movements and postures that you're making that's a good sign that his subconscious is paying attention to you.


For example: he takes a sip of his drink a few moments after you do. Or he rests his arms on the table when you do.
You can use this to flirt with him, as well. Mirror some of his movements. If he crosses his legs, cross yours. When he takes a sip of his drink, wait a few moments and then take a sip of yours.

, Touch is a great indicator of interest. Unless the two of you have been friends for a while and he's completely comfortable with you, it's unlikely that he's going to touch you a lot.


Some ambiguous touching might be: hands brushing when you're walking together (could be on purpose, could be accidental), patting you on the back (this seems more a friends type touch), anything ""guy-ish"" (like fist-bumps, high fives, and the like).
Touches that are more likely to designate interest: he puts his hand or arm on the small of your back to guide you, when he hugs you the hug lingers (he may brush his hand down your back or along your side), he puts his arm around you.
You can use touch to flirt back with him. Put your hand on his arm when you're talking to him. Nudge him when you say something funny (and grin at him).

, If a guy is interested in you, even if he's ignoring you, he's going to want to be around you. You'll notice that every time you turn around, it seems he's somewhere nearby. Again, even if he's ignoring you, if he's interested he's going to make sure to ignore you nearby.


If he remembers what you tell him, that is one of the best signs. That means that not only was he listening to what you were saying, that he cared enough to remember it. If he's only in it for sex or for his own ego, he might pretend like he's listening, but he probably won't actually be listening.
Make sure that you listen to him as well. He'll love that you're interested in him and that you remember what he says to you. It'll show that you think he's important.

, A lot of times if a guy's into you he's going to be a bit nervous around you. This is because he wants to make a good impression on you, so he's going to be trying to act cool.


Look for things like unexplained laughter, sweaty palms, or fidgeting but if he's keeping you in the friend zone, then don't bother with him. He might have a little difficulty maintaining eye contact with you without becoming a little uncomfortable.
Do your best to make him comfortable. Tell him about that time you spilled a drink all over yourself at your work party, or something to make you seem human and not inhumanly awesome.

, If a guy likes you he's going to want to impress you and he's going to want to be there for you. If a guy is doing nice things for you he's probably a little bit interested in you, especially if those things are coupled with some of the other signs.He might do something like lend you his jacket when you're cold, or he might offer to buy your coffee drink even though you aren't dating, or he might offer to drive you to the airport when you have to catch a flight.
Do nice things back to him. This way he'll see that you are someone who doesn't take other people for granted and that you notice and appreciate what it is that he's doing. If you aren't interested in him try not to take advantage of his interest in you.

, A guy who likes you is going to want to, subtly or unsubtly, tell you how much he appreciates you. Hopefully this will extend beyond simply compliments about your appearance, but those can be nice, too.He might compliment you on a new haircut (which means that he's been paying attention), or tell you that you're doing an awesome job on that project for school.

, As said above, if a guy likes you (really likes you) he's going to want to know about you. That means that he's going to listen and remember when you talk. If he isn't listening, it's a pretty good bet that he's not interested. You can do better!


He's also unlikely to ask you any questions about yourself. This is a guy you definitely want to stay away from. Either he's not interested, or he is interested, but he's too much of a narcissist to really see you as a fully fledged person who's interesting in their own right.

, While some guys can be nervous about making eye contact with a person they're interested in, at some point they usually do so. If he's looking at the room instead of you, especially if he doesn't seem to be listening to you, then he's definitely not interested.


A big warning sign for someone like this is if he's too busy checking his phone to listen to you. It means that he's more interested in other people than he is in you.

, His body language can tell you a bit about how he's feeling, whether he's interested or not interested. If he isn't interested his body language should make that pretty clear.


He never tries to get closer to you, or touch you, even subtly. If he doesn't do particularly nice things for you, or anything for you, this could be a sign that he's not interested.
Again, even if a guy is shy or dealing with his interest by ignoring you, he's still going to want to be around you. If the guy is never around, well, that's a sign he's not interested.

, With a very, very few exceptions, a guy will get in touch with a girl he's interested in. He will. A text message takes five seconds to write and send, even if it's just an ""I'm busy at work. I'll text you later."" A guy who is interested in you won't leave you hanging, especially if he wants you so bad., If the guy always manages to wriggle out of meeting your friends he's probably not that interested in you. Yeah, you don't want to introduce him to all the friends right off the bat, but if it's been a while and he's still the mystery man to your friends? He's not that interested.


This is also true if he avoids introducing you to his friends. It shows that he's not very serious about you, because otherwise he'd be dying to show you off to his buddies.

,How to Meet Women1,
"
Go online.,
Ask your friends.,
Try an introduction agency.,
Consider women at your workplace.,
Go where the singles hang out on purpose.,
Attend a class or a course.,
Be aware of your surroundings.",How to Meet Women2," It is now well established that online dating sites are a regular part of meeting people with like interests. Find a dating site that appeals to you and create a profile. You can either look through the women already on the site according to mutual interests or you can wait for women to find you.


When uploading a profile, look approachable and neat. Wear clothes, too––naked bodies, no matter how buff, are not the way to go when online.
Avoid lying. If you're older and less fit than you'd like to be, don't cover this up. Your potential date won't hang around if she comes face-to-face with your untruths upon meeting you.
If you do get nibbles, reply promptly, so as not to cause the women to think you're lazy or uninterested.
Be open-minded to all those interested in you. If you put an age-range or any other restrictive ranges into your wishlist, you could miss out on women who might be slightly outside those expectations but are ideal for you. It also sounds really bossy and perfectionist to list restrictive preferences and will scare off many women even if they fall within your restrictions.

, Friends, both male and female, are a good place to begin when you're seeking to meet someone new. Your friends will know of single women who are looking for a chance to date--from sisters and work colleagues to friends from hobbies or sports they pursue.


Organize, or have your friends organize, a party or dinner event at which the two of you can meet.
Consider a blind date with this person.
Be sure to ask your friend about why he or she thinks this woman might be compatible with you. It will help you to come up with topics of conversation before you meet.

, If the thought of going online seems a tad too exposing or impersonal to you, you might prefer to try an introduction agency, where the agents do all the work of matching and arranging introductions for you.


Many online sites operate as both, so check the details when looking at the website, as you might get the chance to try both ways.

, It's up to you whether workplace romances are taboo or not; in some cases, company policy prevents anything of the sort. But where this isn't an issue, there are both good and bad reasons to date someone from work.


On the plus side, many women at work will likely have similar interests, schedules and availability. What's more, you don't have to go trawling through bars and clubs to meet them.
On the downside, breakups after a relationship can impact work badly, office gossip can be difficult and charges of favoritism can be rife.

There are ways of handling all the challenges though, so if you do like someone at work, perhaps it's worth the effort.


Never harass a woman. Workplace procedures are in place to deal with any element of sleaziness, inappropriate touching or comments, etc. for good reason. Make sure she won't misinterpret your intentions by being open, clear and caring. Avoid using dirty language or innuendos.
Leave alone any idea of having an affair or dating a woman who is going through a divorce.
Keep personal communications personal. Don't use the workplace email to serenade her. Use your personal email addresses or speak to her directly instead.

Your IT team can recall anything from work emails, so if you do use them, be careful and never send anything that couldn't be shared with everyone else in the office.


Think really hard before attempting to date a boss, manager or supervisor. Charges of favoritism will be all too easy to lay against you and the imbalance in power at work may also influence an imbalance of power in your personal relationship, which isn't healthy for either of you.

, There are plenty of opportunities for meeting single women in a city, town or similar environment. Some examples include:


Clubs, nightclubs, bars/sports bars and restaurants

Be wary of noisy dance clubs, as conversation opportunities are very limited and if you do hook up before talking, you may discover she's night and you're day when you finally do get to talk


Speed dating events
Singles parties
Hobby or sports events that end with a party or get-together
Dinner parties, dinner events, tasting events (wine, chocolate, anything else sensual)
A singles cruise or other specially organized singles event that is a bit more out of the ordinary.

, If you're passionate about something, from sailing to food art, you might find equally passionately driven women by joining a class or course focused on that very topic. You'll certainly have lots to talk about together.


Hit the gym. Not only will you reap the benefits of fitness, but often classes are full of--you got it: mostly women.
If you happen to be one of only a few men––or the only man––at the course or class, you'll be considered somewhat special!

, Life itself presents many opportunities to meet women––if you're open to the possibilities.


For example, standing in the supermarket queue, try striking up a conversation with the women alongside you who has attracted your attention for all the right reasons.
Catch a woman's eye while commuting home on public transportation and make an amusing comment about something relevant, then introduce yourself.
Daily places where conversations might be possible with women include the laundromat, waiting at a bus stop, shopping (including saying hi to the shop assistant you fancy so much), working out at the gym, walking your dog, clearing up your front yard as she passes by, the library, the video store (you already know her taste in movies), large outdoor events and pursuing recreational/sporting activities.
Church and community group events can also bring you into contact with women who have the same set of beliefs and values that you do. There are bound to be many opportunities that come up through such institutions from your regular attendance.

"
Look the part.,
Act the part.",How to Meet Women3," Even though it is said that nobody should judge a book by its cover, first impressions count enormously when people don't know one another yet. It is always in your favor to look your best.


In those first moments, you will be sized up and categorized depending on what you're wearing, how much you've groomed yourself and whether you've cleaned your shoes, no matter how much you may resent this reality! To help yourself meet women, stay well groomed and dress stylishly, according to your own tastes.
When looking to meet someone, wear clothes that represent you. They should be in good condition, pressed if needed (obviously not all clothing needs pressing, so use your instincts), free of holes and without stains.
Keep your hair in good shape. Take time in the morning to style your hair, shave, and get a haircut every 8 weeks.
Leave the grungy workshop or gardening clothes at home. Unclean, messy clothing reduces your confidence and doesn't help you to stand out. Grungy clothing on either sex tells the world, ""I'm not interested at the moment, thanks.""
Go easy on the cologne. She shouldn't be able to smell you from across the room.

, Be the type of man a woman would want. Take small opportunities to show her you're a gentleman. Then, of course, follow up with casual conversation.


If you see a woman with her hands full, offer to help! A courteous stranger will be sure to pique her interest.
Any situation can be an opportunity to converse. Explain a bus schedule, inform her of a better value down the street, or offer her spare change when she's fumbling through her purse. Don't expect anything in return, however; allow her to reciprocate.

"
"
Look approachable.,
Look at women's faces, not their chests.,
Stay relaxed.,
Make a connection.,
Know when to end the conversation.",How to Meet Women4," Meeting people is helped by appearing open and willing to be approached. This includes using open body language, smiling and presenting a broadly positive demeanor.


As well as good grooming, your body language has a big impact on whether or not someone feels able to approach you. Moreover, the tone, speed and volume of your voice has an impact too.
Look and act confident. Self-doubt is noticeable by other people; prepare yourself mentally to be confident and fake it if need be!
Stay positive––nobody wants to hear a litany of woes the first time they meet you. Even if life is treating you unkindly at the moment, don't pass this on to her when you first meet.

, She may be stunning, but she won't stay near you if all you can do is stare at her breasts. Focus on her as a person; take in her face and truly listen to what she is saying. Maintain good eye contact without staring her out.


Remember her name. Use her name when talking to her--she'll feel subconsciously more at ease with you.
Value the place of small talk. It may be tiny, but it's a safe approach for getting to know one another better. Moreover, it's not what you say at this stage but how you say it: with warmth, friendliness and interest.

, Everyone is nervous when meeting someone new and wanting more than just a mere handshake from them. But it's important to settle your anxiety as much as possible by reminding yourself that you're worthy.


Avoid seeing the meeting as an audition. This causes you to put yourself on show and to treat her as being on show too. This can only end badly when things don't go according to script. Instead, relax into yourself and treat this as a fun opportunity to get to know someone without worrying about where it may or may not lead.
If you think you're good enough for the woman in question, she'll sense this and reciprocate your confident stance. If you act unworthy, you risk being treated as such. Attract the response you want by being confident and engaged in the moment.

, Try to find out what this woman really loves in the world, and let her tell you all of the things she loves about it. Then, tell her you feel just the same way about some things, but don't overdo it; it's important to show that you're well rounded by gently disagreeing with her opinions on a few non-controversial things.


For instance, ""Yeah, I really like Van Gogh too, but Monet is much too simplistic."" That way, she'll know you're not just saying ""yes"" all the time to make her like you but that you are willing to converse intelligently.
Do not tell too much information about yourself at first contact; it can make you look too desperate to get a sweetheart and too social to her liking. Act like a lonely, working man with a capable mind.
Women are incredibly sensitive to ""personal bubbles."" Be sure not to crowd her--a good distance is about three feet. Instead of the chair next to her, choose the one across. If she leans in, bingo.

, Going on for too long can make you seem desperate or even scheming. When this woman is someone you'd really like to see again, say something like, ""You know, I would love to hear more but I have to get back to work now. Tell me all about it over salsa dancing on Tuesday."" Always leave the conversation to be continued. Do not exhaust the conversation as things can turn awkward and she may lose interest.


Do not allow her to end the conversation or date; if she wants to quit, stall the ending by thinking of a few things to say and then end the meeting. She will now hang around longer at the place; if you have the chance, return. Then ask for her telephone number.
Of course, as with everything, there are exceptions. If you feel that whammy of chemistry connecting the two of you and you go on to talk all night and into the next day, let the flow take you where it will. Sometimes, this is what happens--with no rhyme or reason.

"
Make eye contact with the girl you want to talk to.,
Smile, and see if she smiles back.,
Read her body language.,
Walk up to her in a non-threatening manner and introduce yourself.,
Ask her if she’ll let you buy her her favorite drink.,
Sit next to her and try to find common interests.,
Practice the technique wherever you go.",How to Approach Women in Bars1," A great way to let someone know that you’re interested in them is by making eye contact with them.

Make sure not to stare for a long period of time, or it may come off as creepy. She may not notice you the first time around, but don’t get discouraged. Make sure you’re in her view, and try to catch her when she’s looking in your direction.

If a girl makes eye contact with you but her face remains rigid, confused, disgusted, or expressionless, there’s a good chance she’s not the one to approach.
If a girl makes eye contact with more than 2 or 3 times in a row, there’s a good chance she’s interested in you.Research shows that those who are in love tend to stare into each other's eyes for longer periods of time.;
, All smiles are not created equal. The kind of smile you’re looking for is a genuine smile that uses the muscles in her eyes and her mouth, otherwise known as a Duchenne smile.

Some women just smile at others to seem non-threatening or polite, not as an invitation to talk.

People smile more often when they see someone they find attractive.Smiling will also make you more approachable., Are her arms crossed, is she avoiding eye contact, or pointing away from you? These are all signs that she is not interested.A woman who is interested in engaging you will often have a straighter posture, with her knees pointed in your direction.


If the girl preens or touches her hair, this is also a sign that she’s into you., Never approach a girl from behind or engage in physical contact when you don’t know her. This can disgust them, and ruin your chances of talking to them for the rest of the night. Instead, approach her so she can see you, and maintain a smile as you walk up to her.


Do not walk directly towards her like you have a mission. Instead walk in her direction, but make approaching her seem natural and not forced.Things to say include, “Hi,” “Hey,” “Are you having fun?,” or “I saw you at the other end of the bar.”
You do not need an elaborate pick-up line, and some girls even find them corny.

, A good excuse to begin a conversation is to talk over drinks. It’s also a friendly gesture that she will appreciate. Always make sure to ask her what kind of drink she wants before buying one.


If she refuses and seems uncomfortable, you should walk away.
If the girl takes the drink but then doesn’t seem interested in talking, you need to accept that. Not all girls want to talk., Take a seat next to her if she accepts the drink and it seems like she wants to talk. Try to find common interests. You can pull from your surroundings like the city and town you’re in, the bar you’re patronizing, or a local sports team. Try to figure out the type of person she is, and talk about what she’s interested in.

, Practicing these techniques outside of a bar or club situation is ideal because it will acclimate you to doing it in low-stress situations. Try out this method at the grocery store, shopping mall, or in school in order to meet new friends.


Trying it out in a low-stress situation to a woman that you aren't interested in will allow you to practice without fearing rejection."
"
Understand that rejection is part of the dating deal.,
Listen to your gut instinct.",How to Meet Women5," Some women won't be interested because they don't feel the spark or the click. Respect that––it's far better to have honesty up front than to insist on a meeting of minds and bodies that is never going to be nicely compatible but is forced and uncaring. Rather than taking rejection personally, realize that this is an important step in finding the right woman amid a sea of women who aren't your perfect match.


Sometimes you'll be rejected because it's not the right time in her life to be committing to a relationship. Perhaps she's going through a messy divorce, perhaps a big career move is on her radar or perhaps she just needs time to heal after a bad relationship. If she is really worth it, give her wide berth while remaining friendly and just be patient. Otherwise, wish her the best of luck and keep looking.

, A single rejection doesn't mean there is something wrong with you as a person (she may like you but not know how to express it!). However, if you experience repeated rejections, you may want to address your grooming, your mannerisms with women, or even your whole approach. It could be that you're doing something wrong and that's always easy to fix.

"
"
Introduce yourself to the group of girls.,
Be the life of the party and buy her and her friends drinks.,
Remember to pay special attention to her, but don’t isolate her.",How to Approach Women in Bars2," If you see that a group of girls are out together, it’s important that you recognize all of them and treat them equally. Even if you only like one girl in the group, ignoring or dismissing her friends will often make them angry at you or make you seem like a jerk.


It's okay to change who you target if you meet someone more interesting or attractive that's in the group. Just make sure that you aren't sending signals to more than one girl or problems may arise.
Some good opening lines include, “Hey girls, how’s everything going tonight?"" or ""Are you all having fun?”
Another good way to open, is to ask them their opinions on a relevant topic that you have debated with a friend.Examples include “Me and my friend were debating over whether the new Kanye album was as good as his old stuff. What do you girls think?"" or ""My buddy thinks that vodka is the best liquor, but I think whiskey is. What do you girls think?”
Shaking hands is a good way to make physical contact with new girls that you meet, but some may even be receptive to hugging. If they go for the hug, reciprocate it.

, If you can make a good impression on her friends, it will make you look a lot better to the girl that you have your eyes on. Also, in some circles it is considered tacky to buy one girl a drink but then ignore her friends.If you don’t have enough money to buy everyone drinks, you can offer to buy them songs on the jukebox.
Refrain from being mean to any of her friends.

, As much as you want to engage her friends and keep them happy, you also don’t want her to start thinking you’re not interested in her. Try to go out of your way to pay her special attention, but never do it in an aggressive way.


When you are talking to her friends, make sure to compliment her, specifically, in a non-sexual way.
If there is a lull in the conversation, or people break off into individual groups, take your chance to speak with her one on one.

"
"
Expect only to have a fun night out.,
Don’t take rejection hard and don't get discouraged.,
Feel confident that being yourself is good enough.,
Don't force things or feel defeated.,
Don’t go to the bar if you’re broke.",How to Approach Women in Bars3," For those that suffer from social anxiety, it might be therapeutic to meet new people. However, expectations can create additional stress because you’re striving for an expected outcome.

Instead of ruminating on the things you need to do when you go out, try to stay loose and have fun. Concentrate on your own happiness, not approaching women.

For some people, hyper-social situations like bars or clubs overwhelm them. If you are like this, then try joining a hiking group or a local sports club before diving into the bar scene.
Never expect to get intimate when going out and meeting girls.

, Not everyone will want to talk to you, and that’s a reality that you need to embrace. Extenuating circumstances like an existing significant other, may cause the woman to not want to speak with you.You must also realize that rejection is typically not a reflection of who you are as a person., Even though it’s tempting to pretend, women can pick up on whether someone is genuine or confident. Don’t try to compensate for your personality by talking about things that aren’t true, and be confident in who you are, whether it’s positive or negative.


Having positive thinking and keeping a positive self image will help you build confidence. If you don’t think you’re a great person, just think about all the things that you’ve done to bring happiness to other people.
Breathing slower and relaxing your neck and shoulder muscles can also help you with your confidence., There will be some nights where no women you approach will be receptive to talking to you. In these cases, don't get desperate and start going for whoever is in front of you. Instead, relax, and realize that you won't be successful every single night.


Instead of getting upset, go home and do something you really like or get take-out at your favorite restaurant.
Never insult anyone if you're having a hard time talking to women. This will only make you come off as a jerk, and will likely ruin your chances of talking to a woman for the rest of the night.

, If you don’t have the money to spend, you’re not going to feel confident throughout the night and you’re going to be stressed about spending money. If you don’t have the cash, then just figure out another social event you can do that doesn’t require funds.


You can meet people at the grocery store, park, or school if you have a limited budget.
Don’t spend your money on the bar if you have responsibilities you’re struggling to maintain like rent or loan payments.

Start by taking a shower.,

Congratulate yourself!",How to Ask a Guy to Dance at a School Dance," You want to look, smell, and be clean and fresh. Step into the shower and use your favorite scented shampoo for an extra sense of cleanliness. If you need to shave your legs do that as well. Once you step out of the shower and dry yourself off, apply some moisturizer. (It doesn't need to be scented, but it can be if you want.) This will keep your arms and legs soft. Afterwards, wash your face with a good face wash.;
, First, brush out any tangles you have and make sure your hair is fairly smooth. Now begin blow drying your hair while brushing it. Take a break once in a while between blow drying and take the time to comb out any tangles before doing it again, so it isn't a painful process at the end.

, Make sure your clothes are appropriate. Even if all the popular girls are wearing really short dresses, doesn't mean you should.

, Pick a cute bag that matches your outfit! Fill it with money for snacks (if available), have extra makeup (just in case!), gum (bad breath is not good) and your phone. Depending on the size of your bag, you can add some extras. Such as, a small water bottle, a brush, feminine products, perfume or lotion.

, Don't look desperately all over the place, and don't stand by the door craning your neck every which way. Walk over to some friends, first. Try to spot him from there, but if you can't, excuse yourself and get a glass of punch. Look for him, but not too obviously. Look distracted at the same time. When you do find him, take a deep breath and relax. Try not to be nervous before you walk over.

, Let him talk to his friends, and spend some time with yours. Wait until the middle of the dance to ask him. If you procrastinate, you may lose your chance! Spend that time thinking about what you're going to do. Maybe ask the DJ to put on a slow song!

, If you had garlic pizza right before the dance, chew on some mint gum! Check your makeup and apply some perfume/lip gloss if you want. if you've still got butterflies, just tell yourself to calm down, because let's remember, it's just a guy. The world won't end if he refuses.

, Even though this is the big moment, don't seem too uptight or formal, it will make you less approachable. Just be normal.


If he's talking with his friends, wait until their conversation is over. Don't interrupt, it might seem a little rude. instead, if the conversation has gone on for a while and he still hasn't noticed you, lightly tap him on the shoulder.

, Smile, so he doesn't think he's in trouble.

, Don't yank on his arm, just lightly brush your fingertips on his arm and motion for him to follow you.

, If you're crazy nervous though, you could say something like, ""This dance is nice. Are you having fun?"" or ""You look really nice, I love your outfit."" Don't keep pulling those, though, just say one thing as an icebreaker.

, Just say, ""I was wondering if you wanted to dance."" or ""Would you like to dance?"" Keep it simple.

, If you dance to a fast paced song, it may be less pressure while still spending time with him. Plus, if he wants to keep dancing, he may ask you to dance on the next slow song!

, Tell him it's no big deal and just calmly walk away. Avoid asking why too. Keeping a cool head is much better than bursting into tears. If he says yes, go onto the dance floor with him.

, If you feel uncomfortable with his hands on your hips, lead them a little bit higher. After about a minute of the song, if you feel comfortable, put your head on his shoulder.


When the song is over, you don't have to keep dancing, But don't just leave. Talk with him for a little bit, but if he wants to leave, don't bother him. Just tell him you had fun, smile and walk away.

, You just danced with a guy! Good job and good luck!

Before asking him, think about where you want to go.,
Choose an activity that both of you will enjoy.,
Consider the method you'll feel most comfortable with.,
If you feel really worried about how he will respond, try face to face.,
Just relax.,
Ask him what he is doing on the date you'd like to arrange the activity together.,
If he says he's free, go ahead and ask him on the date.,
If he says yes, that's a great idea, well done!,
If he says he is really busy, don't push it.,
If he says no because he doesn't like what you've suggested, be ready with an alternative.,
If he says he needs to think about your suggestion, take it at face value.,
Don't force him.",How to Ask a Boyfriend out on a Date," As part of this, consider how much it will cost, how far away it is, how long the activity will take and whether you have already done something similar before.


Do you want the date to be just the two of you or would also like friends to come along?;
, While making a compromise now and then to do something he likes a lot that you don't much care for is part of the relationship, if this is the first time for asking him on a date, choose something you will feel comfortable about too.

, This will depend on your relationship and how you usually contact each other too. You can text him, call him, email him, talk to him on IM (instant messenger), write him a nice letter, or speak face to face.


You might also like to contact him one way, then follow up with another way, just to confirm his affirmation to going on the date, and the time, etc.

, It's a lot harder to say no or push aside someone's kind request when you're face to face. He'll see immediately how much effort this requires of you and be more willing to meet you all the way if you are together when you ask. Have courage––he cares about you after all!

, He is your boyfriend, after all. While he might say no, he is more likely to say yes, or to suggest you make another suggestion if he does say no. He isn't going to bite you or laugh at you; if he does, he's not boyfriend material.

, For example:


""Are you doing anything this weekend? I have an idea for something we could do together.""
""Any chance you're free this coming Thursday night? There's something I'd like to suggest we do together.""
""Would you be free next week? I'd like to go somewhere together for a few days of the vacation if you are.""

, Tell him what you'd like to do together, why you think it'd be fun and any other relevant details to help him reach his decision.

, Start planning the activity together.

, He actually means it and being pestered about it will end up irritating him and could sour things for you both. Just say something like: ""Okay, maybe another time then"", or ""No problems. It'll keep until you're free."" He'll appreciate the lack of pressure and the willingness to change your plans for him.


Leave off asking him again for at least a week. That way, you won't seem pushy or desperate.

, For example, if he says he has already seen a movie or doesn't like the genre you've suggested, have one or two different ones to offer instead. Or, switch from movies to skating/a sports game/dinner out, etc. Be ready with flexible options.


Other possibilities include going to the park, the beach, out of town, etc.
Another option is to ask him what he'd rather do. However, it's a good idea to offer your ideas first, to show you've really thought about this.

, He does need to think about it. This does not mean he is not interested in you; it means he needs to think about the activity. Feel free to say something like: ""Sure, no worries. If you do want to, maybe you can let me know by tomorrow/Friday/the weekend, so that I can book tickets/reserve the seats/etc."".

, That's a good way of him dumping you. There are plenty of other times to ask again.


If he keeps declining your suggestions, it's a good idea to ask him what he'd rather do. If you feel you can't ever make suggestions, you might need to rethink the viability of the relationship, as all relationships are about give and take.

Develop the patience to let things develop at a pace based on someone else's interest rather than on yours. Don't let the fact that all your friends seem to have that special someone make you impatient; instead, pace yourself and take it easy it just isn't your time yet and there is no deadline on pairing up with another person.


Don't initiate contact. Let him be the first to come to you. The person who makes the first move is always put in a weaker bargaining position than the person who chooses whether or not to accept it.
Don't be the first to call. Let him call you. Remember, men like to know that you're interested, but they still like the thrill of the chase.
Don't be the one to set up the first dates. Instead, give him hints if he needs nudging along: ""My friend just bailed on the camping trip, so it looks like I'm going to be free this next weekend."";
, If you're busy enjoying your life as it is, playing hard to get will come naturally because you'll have too much going on in your everyday life to be easily available. The bottom line is that if you're happy, and carefree, people will notice.


Go out with your friends. Don't be a wallflower. It's hard to play hard to get if you're never out on the town. Do fun things that make you happy and you'll stop wondering how to play hard to get and start living it.
Meet new people. Go to social events, join clubs at school, ask your friends to introduce your to their friends. Really take interest in those people. The more people you know, the more credible your busy schedule will be.

, The key is to keep the other person asking questions so that they can find out more about you. For example:


If asked what you did last weekend, say ""I hung out with some people I know.""
If asked what you're doing this Friday, say ""I'm not sure yet.""
Use a lighthearted, flirtatious tone, and smile. You don't want to sound completely uninterested or flippant, so even if you keep your answers short, keep them sweet as well.
The habit of never quite answering with the entire facts can be a useful habit to start even at the beginning of a confirmed relationship, as it lets the other person know what will happen if they pry too much! This lets you maintain your boundaries.

, If he or she calls you, don't answer all the time, and wait a day or two before calling back. A good rule of thumb is to wait about twice as long as they do before calling back.


If the call is urgent, for example, if they want to make plans for that night, consider ignoring the call; it'll show the person that your time is valuable, and if they want to get together, they need to plan accordingly. (Of course, accept that sometimes a spontaneous date can be romantic and fun, but that's not the main subject of this article.)
In terms of texting, it's generally a good idea to avoid responding immediately.

, Say ""maybe"" or that you're ""not sure"" and that you have to check your schedule. Ask them to get back to you later in the day, or the following day. And occasionally, say you can't make it because you have other plans. Of course, if you're interested in this person, offer to make plans on a day that you're supposedly free, whether it's the day after or the next weekend.

, Whenever someone gets clingy, pull away. Shy away from firm answers or commitments. Try to leave as many options open for yourself as possible, for as long as possible. Expect anyone you date to follow the steps in How to Tame a Free Spirit. It's also helpful if you know how to spot the signs of a clingy person, including:


They constantly email, text, or phone you even though you haven't responded to anything. They'll even call to say ""I missed a call. Was that you?!""
They always call first. Often it's before you're even up.
You have observed that they don't seem to do much else in their life, apart from hanging around you. When you ask them what they do, they can't really tell you anything else other than going to work or studies.

Insecurity stalks them like a hunter follows prey. It's also clear from talking to them that they have a happiness deficit with respect to their own life and sense of life's purpose. Related to their insecurity is the need to agree with everything you say.
You can spend hours telling them the dullest details of your hobby or work and they sit there, riveted. It's not likely you'll have the patience to test this sign though – you're too busy!

, You're almost there, but you're not quite there yet. Make sure that for the first couple dates, you follow some of the steps here:


Don't settle on one person right away unless you know they're the one. Again, playing hard to get will be easier if you are actually hard to get.
Tell him that your other dates with guys so far has largely fallen flat. This will let him know two big things: 1) that you're dating other guys; and 2) that you're a tough cookie to crack.

This is a classic ego boost for a man. You're assuring him that you're exactly what other guys want, but that he has a shot at getting it. He'll want you even more.



, Give him small reminders that his conquest is worthwhile and that he's not just wasting his time barking up the wrong tree. A little encouragement goes a long way, but be erratic with your encouragement so he stays on his toes.


Text him something like: ""You're sweet. That was a pretty nice date. Let me know when you want to try it again.""
Long notes or love-letters are generally a little too gushy. Instead, leak some selective information to his friend about how ""things are going pretty well so far."" He'll tell his friend what you said.
Give him a kiss when he least expects it. Don't do this if you haven't kissed before, because you want him to make the first move. When he's sitting down reading a book, or walking along, go up to him, look him in the eyes, and give him a smooch. His heart will race and he'll be even more invested in you.

Build up your self confidence if it's sorely lacking. Now, this doesn't mean you have to be loud, boisterous, arrogant, chatty, or forward. It just means getting to a place where you feel comfortable in your own skin.


You can be secure, sweet and humble all at the same time. But be prepared to come out of your shell. Guys like confident, interesting girls who lead their own lives.
The only guys who like insecure girls are the ones who are insecure themselves and want to dominate another human being. And who wants to be with a guy who wants a girl to feel bad about herself or who wants to tell you how to be all the time? That's not healthy, and you deserve much better.;
, Without being fake, make an effort to look your best around the guy you like. Guys are visual creatures so looking your best will simply spin the odds in your favor. But most importantly, when you look your best you'll feel your best - giving you the confidence you need to let your awesome personality shine through.


A little make-up can go a long way. You don't need to color-by-number your face, but mascara opens up your eyes, lip-balm enhances your smile, concealer can cover and insecurities, and tweezers could really help nightmare eyebrows. Just wear what you are comfortable with.
Dress in clothes you feel comfortable in. Don't squeeze yourself into a body-con skirt if that's not your usual style. A well-fitting pair of jeans and a top that brings out the color of your eyes is a safe but striking combo.
Smile a lot - research has found that people become more attractive to others when they smile, so flash those pearly whites as often as possible to look prettier, as well as friendlier and more approachable.

, A guy can't fancy you if he doesn't know you exist. If you haven't caught his eye yet, then get him to notice you. Make sure you show a little interest and drop small hints that you like him.


Most guys won't ask you out because they're afraid of getting shot down. You've got to walk before you run, right? Say ""Hi"". Say ""Good-bye"". Give a little wave. When he reciprocates, you'll know that you have his attention.

Introduce yourself somehow and make conversation. It's nearly impossible for someone to like you if he doesn't get to know you, unless he ""likes"" you for all the wrong reasons.

, Having a good sense of humor makes everything better. This doesn't mean you should be a giggling fool, laughing at everything that crosses your path, but you should try not to take yourself too seriously and always be ready with a laugh, especially when your crush is around.


If you're too serious or straight-faced all the time, he may find you intimidating and unapproachable, which is the last thing you want.
Express your sense of humor in your own way. Some people are witty and sarcastic, others can tell hilarious stories, and many people just do quirky things and poke fun at themselves.
No matter what tickles your sense of humor, it's much easier to like someone who you can have a good laugh with once in a while. If you don't find something to laugh about together, then maybe you'll discover that you don't like him after all!

, A guy is not going to hit on you if he thinks you're taken, so it's your job to make it clear that you are single and ready to mingle.


If you have a Facebook account and he's not already in your friends list, invite him; just make sure your status is set as single!
You should also make it obvious in other subtle ways, such as hanging out with your girlfriends in a place where you know he'll be, dropping subtle hints about not knowing who to go with to an event, etc.
Letting your friends in on the situation is probably a good idea - they can help strategize to get the two of you together, and also diffuse any awkward situations. They also know where you stand on the relationship front and won't start falling for him themselves.

, Being a guy's friend first gives you two great benefits: he gets to know you and you get to know him, without the awkwardness of being in a dedicated relationship. Treat him like you would all your other friends - be casual and comfortable around him.


Guys will usually be more open with guys than girls, but that doesn't mean that you can't get close - that's usually where the magic happens.
Just be careful though - if it gets too platonic, you might lose the romantic connection and sometimes it can be really hard to get back that spark once you are placed firmly in the friend-zone.
If this happens, things can become too complicated and you might be tempted to give up. A little bit of flirtation throughout the relationship will keep things going nicely.

, This may seem like a no-brainer, but actually talking to the guy you like (rather than pining after him from afar) is of utmost importance when it comes to getting him to like you.


Ask him stimulating, interesting questions; find out about his life, his family, his friends; tell him funny stories. Anything that opens up a dialogue between the two of you.
If you can get the guy talking about something he's really passionate about - whether it's a favorite sports team, band, author - then you're on to a winner. When he's talking to you about something he loves, he'll start to associate the positive emotions he feels with you!

, Though this may come as surprise, guys love compliments just as much as girls do, so don't be afraid to say something nice to him from time to time. Of course, showering him with fake compliments is not a good idea - you'll just come off as insincere.


Compliment something about his appearance, like his cute dimples or cool new haircut. Just don't overdo it - guys can be shy about that sort of thing. A simple ""I love the color of your eyes"" is all you need to say.
However, compliments don't just need to be focused on appearance. If he's talking about something that he loves, tell him that you admire how passionate he is. You can also compliment his sporting performance or tell him what a great job he did on a class project.

, Finding activities that you can enjoy together can really create a bond between the two of you and allow him to appreciate how fun and interesting you are. Once he sees that you're someone he can share his passions and interests with, he might start to see you as potential relationship material.


If he thinks of himself as the next premier league player, turn up at any football practices you're invited to and cheer him on. If he loves rock-climbing, ask him if he can show you how, and make a good-faith effort to see why he's so into it. Have an open mind.
You can also invite him along to experience some of your interests. For instance, you could bring him along to a dance class or invite him to try out some unusual ethnic cuisine. Discovering that you're a person who can introduce him to new and exciting experiences can be a major attraction for a guy.

, Find out what the two of you have in common and exploit it! Shared interests are the foundation of many a successful relationship, so this step should not be overlooked.


It doesn't matter what the interest is, it could be as simple as the ability to recite lines from Family Guy episodes or as intense as a fascination with astrophysics - as long as it leads him to see you as a kindred spirit.
For example, If you both love a certain kind of music, ask him if he's ever listened to a particular artist and offer to play a CD for him. Or if a mutual favorite band comes to town, invite him to go with you.

, Guys love their friends, so its essential that any potential girlfriend gets along with them. For this reason, it is extremely worth your time to get to know his friends and let them see you as a ""cool girl"". This will let the guy see how easily you could slip into his life - no complications, no drama.


If you can get his friends on your team, that's a major bonus. They will root for you and bring you up around your crush, even when you're not there. This will ensure that you're always on his mind.
Be careful though. You don't want to flirt with his friends. This will send conflicting signals and may make you seem like a tease.

, Once the two of you have got to know one another and are frequently hanging out, you can start to kick things up a gear. Show the guy that you're interested in being more than just friends by flirting with him - it might be just the sign he's been waiting for to ask you out.


Smile. Make sure to smile whenever you see the guy - this lets him know that you're happy to see him. Even if he's in a group of people, reserve the biggest smile for him.
Make eye contact. Making eye contact is an essential flirting technique. One great tip is to look at him from across the room, then once he catches you looking hold his gaze for a moment before smiling and looking away. He'll be hooked.
Make physical contact. Another great flirting technique is to touch the guy in a more-than-friends kinda way. Lightly brush his arm when you're talking, give him a hug when you greet him, or gently mess his hair when you're joking around. This will give him the ""I'm interested"" vibe pretty quickly.

, If you have his number (if you don't, you should ask for it) you can text him things throughout the day to let him know you're thinking of him. You can send funny or flirty texts and if he replies with the same, you'll know you're on the right track.


For example, if he has a sports game or exam coming up, you could text to wish him good luck. He'll hopefully find this sweet and appreciate the fact that you remembered.
However, you should also be sure not to overdo it. Remember the rule: if you send two consecutive texts without getting a reply, you should stop texting. It needs to be reciprocal.

, If the two of you have only been hanging out in group situations or in more formal settings (like school or work) until now, it might be time to invite him somewhere on his own. It doesn't need to be a three-course dinner in a fancy restaurant; it could be something as simple as coffee or the mall.


If he says yes, that's a pretty sure indication that he's interested in you, or at least that he really enjoys your company. Take it as a positive sign and enjoy it. Just try not to let things get awkward - you're just two friends having a good time, right?
If he says no, don't freak out too much. He may genuinely have another commitment, or he may just feel too shy around you to hang out one-on-one. Give it some more time, then try again. If he says no a second time, you might have to face the fact that he's not interested.

, At the end of the day, there's only so much waiting around and hoping you can do. Sometimes your best bet is to tell the guy straight out that you're interested and ask him if he feels the same. Whatever his response is, at least things will be out in the open and you can either move forward with the relationship or move on.


Don't believe the hype about guys having to ask girls out. In reality, guys love strong, confident women who know what they want. In fact, just the fact that you had the courage to ask might be enough to impress the guy and make him say yes.
Never get someone else to ask a guy out for you. It is immature and will increase the chances of the guy saying no. Even if you're too shy to ask him to his face, a text message or handwritten note will be much more effective than the ""send a friend"" method.

, These things take time. You can't force someone to like you, and trying to hurry things up can ruin the courtship altogether. Give him some space and don't be obsessive. Let things progress at a natural pace, or fade out of natural causes.


Eventually he'll tell you one way or another whether or not he's interested in reciprocating your affection. And if he's not, don't hang around him like a lost puppy. Sometimes you might be incompatible in ways that you don't see, and sometimes a guy just isn't ready for a long term relationship.
If this is the case, don't waste any time in moving on! Don't take rejection too personally. It happens to everyone at one time or another.
There are plenty more fish in the sea and as long as you have confidence in yourself, you know that you're a good catch and the right guy is out there waiting for you.

, Finally, but importantly, keep in mind that you cannot control what other people think and do. He may be the object of your interest, but that does not create any obligation that you be an intimate part of his world.


Turn the situation around. If there was some random guy who took an interest in you, is there anything that he could do to make you like him? Probably not.
The reality is that you will either like him that way, or you won't. You will find him attractive or not. You will find him funny or not. All he can do is try to be the best person he can be, and hope that you agree.
The reverse is also true. Be the best person you can be, and let it develop––or not––from there.

, Shy guys’ top priority is secrecy. If a shy guy likes you, it’s extremely likely that he hasn’t told anyone and doesn’t intend to.


Asking his friends has a very serious downside: You may be given bad information about whether or not he likes you. Because he's shy and doesn't express his feelings often, you might get the idea that he's not interested when he actually is.
Asking his friends also has the downside of putting the ball in his court. When he knows — or guesses — that you like him, he's going to think that you want him to ask you out. This makes him feel pressured. As frustrating as it may be, you're going to have to do a lot of the work here, helping him feel relaxed along the way.

, Shy guys’ behavior can be so strange that it might not make sense on its own. Instead of only analyzing his behavior when he’s around you, compare it to how he acts around others. Remember, guys are guys - they will act like guys around their friends, but when it comes to just the two of you talking, he will think before he speaks, tend to be nicer, and will find a way to make you laugh. Look for anything he does extra around you – whether it’s good or bad. Is he extra nice? Extra quiet? Extra nervous? Extra irritable? If he treats you differently than everyone else, he definitely has strong feelings of some sort for you.


Does he get really quiet around you? His inability to talk might be nervousness: He's got a crush on you, and he's so afraid of saying something weird or stupid that he's told himself it's better just not to talk when you're around.

, However, instead of looking for the usual flirting behavior (ex. getting near you, touching you, and other look-at-me body language), watch for signs that he’s uncomfortable around you. If he looks down, crosses his arms, avoids eye contact, or makes nervous gestures more than usual when he’s with you, chances are that he’s making an extra effort to hide his interest in you.


Does he fidget with his hands, clothes, or his hair when you talk to him? These things are definitely a sign of nervousness; talking to you makes him so flustered that he can't keep still.
Does he sweat or perspire around you? Sweating is another sign of nervousness. Sweating is an involuntary bodily function, and if he could control it, he would. But he can't, so his forehead and underarms are likely to bead up.
Does he blush or gulp a lot around you? Blushing can be tough to see, but on some guys it's obvious: His face lights up and he looks like he's just run a mile. Gulping is a sign that he knows he needs to say something but can't find the exact words, or any words, to say.
Is he around you often, but never close to you? It could be that he savors being near you, but doesn't want to tip his hand by being close to you. If he's always somewhere close, but never close enough, he might be as hopelessly drawn to you as you are to him.

, Since shy guys suppress their feelings so much more than other guys, keeping their interest a secret and sometimes avoiding their crushes altogether, they often steal glances to make up for it. Watch him from your peripheral vision to see if he stares at you when he thinks you’re not looking. If he does it more than once, he’s definitely interested. Be careful, though: if you look at him and he turns away immediately, he is totally embarrassed. Smile at him if you want to give him hope.


At the same time, does he avoid looking at you altogether? Even shy guys look at girls some of the time. If he consistently avoids looking at you, it could be that he doesn't want you to notice his secret feelings. Notice whether he looks at other girls to find out if he acts like that in general or just around you.

, Everybody gets nervous when chatting with the person they like, but for shy guys, it’s even worse; usually, they will give you either short, quiet, possibly even snappy answers or they’ll speak very quickly and ramble on out of sheer panic. Again, note whether or not his speaking is extra awkward around you compared to around other people.


Does he give you short ""yes"" or ""no"" answers and refuse to elaborate? It's not that he's not interested in the conversation; it's that he's too interested in the conversation and doesn't want to say anything that might reveal his affection for you.
Is he more confident around his friends? His friends offer him a little bit of psychological support. He still doesn't want to mess up in front of you, but he's a little more willing to engage in conversation.

, It's not necessarily that he likes your friends, it's that he wants an excuse to be closer to you, and he wants to be able to hear about you from the people who know you best. Especially if he makes friends with all of your friends and not with you, it could mean that he's crushing.


With this scenario, make sure he's not flirting with your friends. If he is, it could be that he genuinely likes one of them and not you. On the other hand, he could just be flirting in order to show you that he can impress other girls.

, Though shy guys will avoid actively pursuing whoever they’re interested in, they will often do things passively to show that they care. If he likes you, chances are he’ll be willing to take time out of whatever he’s doing to help you — sometimes over and over again. However, do not abuse your power over him. This is an especially cruel thing to do to a shy guy; in fact, maybe the reason he’s so shy in the first place is because he’s used to being treated badly.


Calmly and sweetly ask him to carry your books or your backpack for you to the next class. If you need an excuse (you don't, you can just ask him), tell him that your back is hurting you and you don't want to make it worse.
Ask him to help you out with hard homework problems. If he's not great at math, don't ask him to help you out with geometry — it'll only make him more nervous. Find out what he's good at and ask him to explain something to you.
Ask him to trade something yummy that he brought for lunch. Maybe he brought some jelly beans and you notice them in the cafeteria. Ask him for some jelly beans in return for a toffee apple or something sweet. If he grants your wish without hesitation, it's a good sign.

, The compliment doesn't have to be over the top — a ""good job on your report"" or ""Hey, thanks for helping me with my math!"" will do. You may find it hard to compliment him, especially if you're shy yourself, but this will go a long way toward making him feel more secure around you and letting you know if he likes you. The most important part to look for is his reaction:



He likes you reaction:

He stammers, clams up, or gets visibly embarrassed or even more shy
He pays you back a compliment of his own, even if it's a little bit awkward



He doesn't like you reaction:

He doesn't seem phased or affected by the compliment at all
He reacts with obvious displeasure or disappointment



, A lot of shy guys feel more comfortable writing from behind a screen than speaking face-to-face. Try to initiate a conversation with him on Facebook, Twitter or Skype and use these tips to tell if he’s flirting with you online.


If he sends you a Facebook request, that's a great sign. Hold out sending the request yourself if you just met him. Wait and see if he does it. Guys usually can do over the internet what they can't in person. And he definitely wants to get to know you if he sends that request.
If he's really talkative online, and enjoys sharing things with you, it's because he relishes the chance to talk with you, but wants to control the situation. He feels more in control now that he doesn't have to worry how he comes off in person.
Ask him questions and see if he asks questions in return. Shy guys are usually pretty good about asking questions (they don't want to have to talk all the time). If he consistently asks you about your past, about your goals, or simply about your day, take it as a good sign.
Don't keep your conversations just on the internet. It's fine to begin talking to him online or in texts, but eventually, you're going to need to approach him and try to get him to open up in person. Otherwise, he'll get too comfortable with the internet and might need extra courage to make the move in person.

, Shy guys often feel at odds with the world — like it's moving at one speed and they're moving at another. This can make basic things like talking to people at school painfully hard. But chances are that a shy guy will have a ""safe place"" where he feels completely at home. If you can find that place and make yourself welcome, that's the first step in becoming more than just friends.


What is that special place? It depends on the guy! For some guys it's the soccer field, for others it's the library. Find out what he loves to do the most and work your way into his comfort zone.

, Shy guys will stay in the friend zone for painfully long periods of time, agonizing about the pros and cons of asking you out. For them, the friend zone is a happy medium. They get to be near and talk to you, but they don't have to risk anything by asking you out. This is a low risk bet for them, and lots of shy guys love it.


Don't get discouraged, and don't believe someone who says you can't date him after you've befriended him. It's simply not true. You are the master of your own universe.

, You tried to read his body language to see if he liked you; now it's time to investigate your own body language to see if you're sending him the right signs. The trick is communicating openness to him, not someone who's closed off:


Communicate openness by smiling, taking off your headphones, talking to people around you, smiling at strangers, and laughing when you feel like it. This subconsciously tells him — It's okay, I don't bite!

If you're stooped over your laptop in a corner, with your headphones on, and ignore other people, he's going to be petrified about approaching you. Avoid ""closed off"" body language at all costs!

, The best case scenario is that you show enough interest in him that he finally sucks it up and asks you out. Then you'll know that he's into you and won't be second-guessing yourself for the entire time you're dating. If you're engaging him in his element, establishing a friendship, manicuring your body language, and staying patient, he will ask you out if he likes you. It's only a matter of time.

, You can send him as many notes in class as you want, or lick your lips so often that it tastes like you're eating lip gloss. But sometimes a guy is just so shy or plain oblivious that the only thing to do is ask him out. Don't worry — it's not the end of the world, and plenty of beautiful, smart, and eligible women have done it. If you like him, it doesn't really matter who asks out whom, as long as you can share the sunlight together at the end of the day.

Instead, you should work on doing your own thing, having a great time with your girlfriends, hitting up the dance floor, or just having a blast without needing a guy. You can smile at him and let him know you’ve noticed him, but focus on having a great time and he’ll want to be right there with you.


Of course, it’s impossible to be in a good mood all of the time. If you’re really having a down day, you shouldn’t feel the need to completely fake it. That said, though, you should work on cultivating a positive energy as much as you can.
Potential boyfriends and potential friends are drawn to positive energy like moths to a flame. The more you laugh and the more joy you have in even the smallest things in life, like a clear night sky or an adorable puppy, the more people will be gravitating toward you.;
, You shouldn’t be too chilly or mysterious if you want to get the guy you want, or he may think that you don’t really like him or that you’re just not very nice. Instead, you can be friendly, introduce yourself, and make a bit of small talk without letting him see that you really like him. Show him that you’re fun to talk to while leaving him wondering where your feelings are at; this will leave him to want to talk to you even more.


Don’t be afraid to say hi and to ask how he is. If he’s wearing a funny shirt, tell him you think it’s cool. Don’t put too much pressure on your first exchanges and just focus on having fun.
Being friendly to others will also make you look like an awesome person who is worth getting to know. Don’t limit your friendliness to the guys you like and make an effort to get to know everyone in your orbit.

, Though you may think that “be yourself” is tired advice, the best thing you can really do to get the guy you want is to be just who you are instead of putting up a front or acting like a girl you think the guy would rather be with instead. Don’t hide your best qualities, even if they’re a bit quirky or out there, because in the end, that’s what makes you special. If you’re faking it, then the guy will be on to you much sooner than you think. Plus, putting up an act is just plain exhausting and you won’t be able to fully enjoy yourself if you feel like you have to constantly check yourself.


Though you may want to wait to show your raunchy sense of humor or your famous impressions of your cat, Fiddles, you shouldn’t act like a different person, or your connection won’t last long.

, Flirting can help you get the guy’s attention and get him more interested in you. While you don’t want to come on too strong, making eye contact for a few seconds, giving him a playful touch on the arm, and a bit of playful banter back and forth can help move your relationship along and can make the guy more intrigued by you. Give him more of your attention than you’d give to other guys, but don’t give him all of your attention, or you’ll be putting all of your cards on the table.


A lot of girls are nervous about how to flirt and don’t really know how to go about it. Start with making eye contact and then breaking it, and then have some lighthearted, fun conversations where you may even end up teasing each other a bit.
Move closer to the guy and see how he reacts. If he gives you a playful push or seems like he’d be receptive to one, then respond in kind.
Some girls like to lick their lips a bit when they flirt with guys so they draw more attention to their mouths.

, Another way to get the guy to notice you is to be fun and lighthearted instead of stressing out over every little thing. While it’s important to be serious about your goals, dreams, and so on, it’s not so important to freak out over your chemistry exam or the fact that you spilled ketchup on your shirt. Learn to laugh at yourself at the right times without being self-deprecating and on brushing the bad things aside.


If you know how to take a joke and laugh at yourself, the guy will like you more because he’ll see that you’re easy to be with. Guys don’t like hanging out with girls who make them feel like they’re walking on eggshells.
Part of not taking yourself so seriously lies in gaining some maturity and perspective. You need to learn that one fight with your friend or one poor math score isn’t the end of the world and isn’t worth freaking out about.

, If you want the guy you want to pay attention to you, then you have to stand out to him in some way. This doesn’t mean you should dye your hair blue and play the banjo — unless that’s your thing — to get his attention, but it does mean that you should be confident doing what you want to do and putting your best foot forward. Maybe you have an incredible sense of humor, awesome dancing skills, or a unique fashion sense. Just remember that if you were like everyone else, you wouldn’t stand out to the guy.


Be proud of whatever makes you different instead of trying to hide it. Having something that makes you stand out will make a guy be more drawn to you than if you blended in with the crowd.

, Guys love girls who are confident and who don’t need them for validation. To wow a guy with your confidence, you just have to be happy with who you are and what you have to offer. Don’t doubt yourself, question your looks, or ask for reassurance. Instead, stand tall, smile, and let the world see how happy you are to be yourself. If you’re happy and comfortable in your own skin, then people will be naturally drawn to you.


Body language has a lot to do with conveying confidence. Turn toward the guy when you’re talking to him and avoid looking down at the floor or fidgeting with your hands. Instead, make eye contact, smile, and show that you’re confident in your social interactions.
People who are confident talk about the people they love and the things they love to do instead of seeking validation by putting others down.
You can show insecurity from time to time and you don’t have to act like the most confident person on the planet all the time. But if you work on loving the person who you are, people will want to soak up some of your positive energy.

, Being realistic is important when it comes to getting the guy you want. While you should have the confidence to feel that you can get any guy you want, sometimes two people just aren’t compatible or are missing that special spark. If a guy you like is just not into it, it’s better to move on to someone who can connect with you a bit more. Some girls think that if they don’t get a certain guy to be theirs, that there’s no one else for them, but they just have to open their hearts up to more possibilities.


If you’ve been trying to make it work with a guy who seems busy, distant, or just not very receptive, then it may be time to move on to bigger and better things.

, If you want to keep the guy interested, then you have to show him that you really care about him and that you want to get to know him. While you shouldn’t follow him around or ask him 20 questions an hour about his life, you should make an effort to get to know what his interests, friends, family, and life are like. Ask him questions about himself from time to time and make eye contact when he tells you something important to show that you really do want to know what he’s saying.


If you get into the habit of talking about yourself and your own problems all the time, then the guy will quickly get bored. Make sure he’s doing about half of the talking.
If you really care about him, then check in with him from time to time to see how he’s doing when you’re not together. If he had a big test, text him to ask how he did. Show that you’re thinking of him when he’s not there.
If he’s knowledgeable about something, whether it’s baseball or politics, ask him to talk to you about it so he shows that you care about the things that matter to him. Of course, if you don’t want a breakdown of the history of the Oakland A’s for the next three hours, you can kindly steer the subject in a different direction.

, Though it’s important to show the guy that you care about him, you should also avoid letting him think that he’s the guy you’ve been waiting for your whole life. Even if you do think this is the case, you and the guy should get to know each other a bit and feel really serious about each other before you start making declarations of love, asking him how many kids he has, or tell him that you can’t stop thinking about him. Once you spend more time together and it’s clear that your affection is mutual, then you can open up to each other a bit more.


Match the guy’s pace as much as you can. If he’s taking things slow and not revealing a lot of his feelings quite yet, then you can hold back from pouring your heart out and take it slow for the time being.
If you start hanging out with each other, play it cool with how often you see each other. You don’t want to make it seem like you’re always available. This will make him appreciate your time together more.

, Another way to make the guy see that you care and to stay interested is to give him sincere compliments when you’re together. Don’t tell him that you think he looks hot and call it a day; let him know that he has an amazing sense of humor, that it’s so easy to talk to him, or that he’s the most creative person you know. Make an effort to get to know him and to give him a compliment that feels truly sincere, not just something that’s calculated to make him like you more.


Keep it simple. Say something like, “You have such a natural way of talking to new people. I wish I could do that” or “I’ve never met someone who knows as much about history as you do.”

, Once you’ve explored that initial attraction, you and the guy you like will want to find something you have in common. Though you don’t need to have everything, or even many things, in common to have a successful relationship, it can help to have a few things that you can talk about and do together to keep your relationship going strong. You can bond over liking the same oldies or Motown hits, hiking, going to baseball games together, or wanting to try every new restaurant in town. It doesn’t matter what you bond over; what does matter is that you find a few interests to explore together.


You can also find a new interest that you’re interested in exploring together, like a new popular band, a new bowling alley in your town, or going hiking together when neither of you have done it before.

, If you want him to see that you really care about him, then you should check in with him from time to time to show you’re thinking of him when you’re not together. Though you shouldn’t call or text him more than once every day or two if you don’t see each other, sending him an occasional call or text, especially if you want to see how his game or interview went or to wish him luck on something important going on, will show him that he means a lot to you.


Make sure you both check in with each other about the same amount of time. It should be mutual.
Not all guys are big phone talkers. If you call him just to chat while he wants to plan your next date, don’t take it the wrong way.

, As your relationship moves forward, your conversations will deepen. You should open up to the guy little by little, letting him know what’s on your mind and what you’re nervous or wondering about. Let him know about your childhood, your friendships, and your relationship with your family members as you get closer and each share something about yourself. As long as he’s opening up, too, he’ll be drawn to you because he’ll feel like he’s getting to know you more and more.


Take your time. Let him get to know you before you reveal the big stuff or he may get overwhelmed and won’t know how to respond.
When he opens up to you, take the time to really listen, instead of revealing more and more about yourself.

, Some affection can help any relationship stay strong and move forward. You can hold the guy’s hand, give him kisses, place a hand on his knee, or give him a big hug when you see him. As you get closer, more touching will be natural, and you should let him see how much he means to you by giving him some physical attention. Just remember not to move forward at a faster pace than makes you comfortable, and to only be affectionate because that’s what you really want.


Different guys have different approaches to PDA. Some just don’t like holding hands or being super affectionate in public. This doesn’t mean that the guy doesn’t want to be seen with you, but that he’s just a little shy about making his private feelings public. Of course, if holding hands in public is really important to you, you two can find a compromise.

, Though you don’t have to play completely hard to get and be so mysterious that he has no idea what’s going on in your mind, if you want to keep the guy hooked, then you can’t act like you’re at his beck and call, either. You don’t have to answer the phone every single time he calls or tell him exactly what your plans are if you’re busy one night. You can tell him that you like him without revealing everything that’s been racing through your head and make him take the initiative. If you keep him guessing a little, then he’ll be even more drawn to you.


Guys like it when a girl can keep them on their toes. If the guy knows exactly what to expect from you every time you talk, then he’ll be less excited to see you.
Of course, you don’t want to get to the point that you’re acting so aloof that he doesn’t think you like him at all. Make sure he does believe in your feelings for him.

, If you want the relationship to stay interesting, then you’ve got to keep things fresh. Falling into the same old dull routine can make that fire flame out pretty fast, so you should always keep him on his toes and find new things to do together to keep your love feeling exciting and dynamic. It doesn’t matter what you do as long as you work to keep your relationship feeling exciting and fun.


This could mean taking a spontaneous road trip once a month, taking up ballroom dancing together, or learning to cook French cuisine together.

, The longer you are together, the more important it will be for you to bond with his friends. While you don’t have to be best friends with them, you should spend some time together, build up a healthy rapport with them, and make sure that they don’t think you’re keeping him from really being who he is. You want his friends to be on your team if you want the relationship to last, and you shouldn’t make him choose between you or his friends, either.


You don’t have to hang out with his friends every second of the day, but when you do see them, say hi and ask how they’re doing and even joke around with them a bit. If you’re serious about the guy you’re with, then you should prepare to be interacting with his friends a lot in the future.

, If you want your relationship to stay new and exciting, then you and your man should find some things that are only meant for the two of you. While keeping things fresh is important, developing some traditions is crucial to the success of your relationship, too. It can be as simple as going jogging together every Sunday, going hiking outside of the city once a month, getting wrapped up in Game of Thrones together, or finding “your” bar, where you play pool and split a pitcher of beer once a week. It’s important to find some things that can help define your relationship together.


Developing traditions together can help your relationship feel special and unique and can give you more things to look forward to together.

, To make your relationship last, you can’t pressure your guy to move forward faster than he’s ready to do. Whether you want to move in together, get married, or have kids, or just want him to meet your parents, you have to remember to slow down and wait for the right time to present itself. If you’re always pressuring your boyfriend to take the next step, then he may feel suffocated and less excited to more forward with you.


Every relationship moves at its own pace, and you shouldn’t pressure your boyfriend to do what your best friends, neighbors, or cousins are doing.
You should decide to move forward together. It shouldn’t be all about putting the pressure on or for waiting for the guy to make the move.

, It’s natural that the longer you date, the more time you’ll spend together, and the more you’ll merge your interests and favorite activities. However, it’s important to not lose sight of who you are apart from your guy, and to continue to make time for your solo hobbies, for your friends, and for your family without your guy by your side. If you both spend time apart doing your own thing, you’ll continue to grow as individuals while helping your relationship grow stronger.


It’s important to always make time for your girlfriends, no matter how serious things are with your guy. They’ll help ground you and will remind you of the person you are apart from your guy and can help you get some perspective.
Plus, if you and your guy spend more time apart, your time together will be sweeter because you’ll be more excited to see each other.

, If you’re serious about each other, then you should never forget to say “I love you” or to let your guy know how much you care. Don’t take his love for granted and assume that he knows how you feel about him. To make your relationship last, you can’t get lazy with your love and can’t make assumptions. It’s important to be open and honest about your feelings every day of your relationship.


Girls can be romantic just as well as boys. Plan a date to sweep him off his feet, go on a surprise weekend getaway in the mountains, or spend your anniversary in the same ice cream shop where you went on your first date. Never stop showing your guy how much you love him and he’ll do the same for you.

He won't be intrigued by you if you give him the cold shoulder and if he feels like you're not interested in him at all whatsoever. So, give him a little smile, a wave, or start a light conversation with him. Flirt just a tiny bit to make him think there's a chance that you like him, but not to make him think that you want him. Just give him enough to leave him thinking about you and wanting to see you again.


Use his name when you talk to him, and make a bit of eye contact.






Avoid making physical contact when you first talk to him, or you may be coming on too strong.





;
, If you want to intrigue a guy, then you have to make him feel like he wants to be around you. If you're in his orbit, make sure you're having a great time with your friends, laughing, talking happily, or even dancing, if you're out -- let him think, ""There's a cool, fun girl. It would be fun to get to know her better."" If he always sees you moping or looking bored or sad, why would he want more of that? Of course, you shouldn't pretend to be fun just to catch his eye, but actually be the kind of girl who is out to have a good time.


He should feel like he should be lucky to be in your orbit -- not that you're looking for a guy to make your life complete.

, If you're getting to know the guy a bit and he wants to hang out, you should be excited about it, but not act like your schedule is wide open. Keep him guessing. Maybe you have a host of other exciting dates lined up. Maybe you have some fun weekend plans with your girlfriends. Maybe you like to spend Friday nights by yourself, translating Latvian poetry into English. He shouldn't know exactly what you're up at all times -- just knowing that you're not always free will make him think that he should cherish his time with you and that you're a dynamic person with a lot going on.


Being a person with a lot of plans and exciting ideas will make you a more interesting, multi-faceted person.






Don't call him all the time, and don't pick up the phone every time he calls or text him back within five minutes whenever you hear from him, either. Let him see that you have a busy schedule, not that you're sitting around and waiting for a call from him.







, If you've started casually dating the guy or just talking to him a lot, you don't have to let him know how much you like him right away. Make him feel special enough to keep wanting to see you, but don't tell him he's the only guy in your life or that you want to be his girlfriend ASAP. Make him figure out that he should ask you to be his girlfriend (if that's what you want) instead of letting him know that he's the only one. This doesn't mean you have to be deceptive -- you should just stay open to all of the opportunities around you.


If he thinks your focus is 100% on him, he'll be less likely to be intrigued by you because he may think he has you in the palm of his hand.







, Playing hard to get can go a long way in intriguing the guy. Even if you think he's the one, you shouldn't throw yourself all over him, tell him how hot he is, or compliment him constantly. Most guys like to be kept on their toes; if you want him to think that you're worth it, then let him see that the chase is never over. And heck, many successful married couples say that the key to their long-lasting love is the feeling that the chase is never really over; if you want to intrigue the guy, then you shouldn't lay it all out on the line in the first five minutes.


This doesn't mean you should be deceptive or manipulate the guy; you should just hold back from telling him you love love love love him right away, or you'll scare him off instead of intrigue him.






It goes without saying: if you start hooking up, don't give it all up right away, either. Make him wait and see that you're worth it. If you get down on the first night, he'll have less incentive to keep courting you.







, If you want to intrigue the guy, then you can't make him think that he knows exactly who you are after your first conversation. Reveal who you are little by little and let him see that you're more than just one thing. Let him see your artistic side by talking about your poetry one time and then show off your sports knowledge by talking about who you think is going to win the Super Bowl the next time you see him. Don't give him your personal biography, either; let him figure out that you spent six months in India or were born in Alaska little by little instead of telling him every little thing right away.


When you talk to him, make sure you ask him questions and that the conversation flows both ways. If you talk the whole time, chances are he'll find out a lot about you right away, and will feel like there aren't a lot of things he'd like to know about you.







, If you want to intrigue the guy, then you have to leave him just when things are getting good. Don't have a great conversation and then let things taper off until you find yourself talking about your grandmother's toe fungus; when you're feeling a really great vibe, tell him it's been great talking to him and say you have to go. Don't do this abruptly if it makes no sense in context or seems rude; but if you're in the halls, for example, don't talk to him until the bell rings and you're late for class. Say a few words to leave him wanting more and wave goodbye.


You can tell him you had a great time talking to him without overdoing it. Let him see that you liked talking to him, too, without making him feel like he can talk to you for as long as he wants any time.







, Men are intrigued by women who know what they want and like to do their own thing. If the guy thinks you'd be the kind of girl who wants to cling to him and to do absolutely everything together, he's likely to feel a little overwhelmed and scared off. Instead, let him see that you have your own interests, friends, and goals, and that you are determined to continue doing what you love, with or without him.


Of course, if you get into a serious relationship with the guy, it's inevitable that some of your interests will merge, but at first, he should be intrigued by your ability to do what you want.






Pursue your passion. Nothing is more intriguing than that.







, Don't be too serious right away. Remember that if the guy likes you, there's a chance he'll wonder what it would be like to date you, so you should be fun, lighthearted, and create a dynamic, exciting conversation when you're together. Don't nitpick him, get into long, pointless conversations, or just be a stick in the mud. Be fun, don't take yourself too seriously, and tease the guy a little bit if he's up for it. He'll be intrigued by your ability to enjoy life and to have a good time no matter what.


If you want to be playful, you can touch the guy lightly on the arm or gently shove him -- just don't overdo the physical contact.







, Men are intrigued by strong, confident women who are comfortable in their own skin. You don't want him to think that you're insecure and looking to fill a void in your life by dating him or he will feel too much pressure when he's around you. Instead, let him see that you like how you look, love what you do, and are happy to be surrounded by all of the awesome people in your life. If you're already happy with who you are, he's much more likely to be happy with you, too.


Body language can go a long way in making you look and feel confident. Hold your head high, maintain good posture, and don't fiddle with your hands too much if you want to look comfortable and secure.






You don't have to sound like you have it all figured out; a bit of vulnerability can be refreshing and honest. But if you're questioning everything about your life currently, then it's best to save the soul-searching for your girlfriends, not for the guy you're trying to intrigue.







, Let him see that you're an accomplished, amazing woman. Stand out in some way, whether it's from being the fastest cross country runner in your high school or from succeeding in your career. Help out at a homeless shelter. Make your own jewelry. Do something unique and impressive because it makes you feel good, and let him see what you're capable of. That's not to say that you should do something just to show off or to make the guy feel like you're putting on a show. Let him see that you're talented, hardworking, and generally awesome, and he will be more intrigued than ever.


Work on being a person other people admire and take the time to care for hours. The more time you spend on being a genuine, well-rounded person, the more the guy will want to get to know you.







, You don't want the guy to feel like he can read you like a book. Surprise him. Go on a random unplanned trip to Tahoe. Do a cartwheel. Suddenly bust out your perfect French in the middle of a conversation about Paris. Let him see that you're capable of doing anything and will always keep him on his toes. Mix up your outfits and hairstyles, and don't let him get used to seeing you be any one way.


Being spontaneous will keep any relationship feeling fresh and exciting. If you're already spontaneous, then the guy will see that a relationship with you will be very exciting.

This isn't necessarily good or bad and it doesn't mean you have to dress yourself to the nines all the time. It does mean that if you want that guy to notice you, you'll have a better chance if you're emphasizing your attractiveness.


Healthy hair is, strangely, an important component in attraction. Thickness, shininess, and scent all play an important part in attracting a guy. Make sure that you're washing your hair a couple times a week (every day strips it of its oils, which it needs to be healthy) and that you're using conditioner.
Wear things that flatter and complement you. This seems like a no-brainer, but lots of people try to wear things that don't look good on them, or that they aren't comfortable in. It is true that a little cleavage (if you're a lady) will get his notice faster than not, but it's more important that you're comfortable in what you're wearing.
Exercise helps to keep you healthy and fit. Find an exercise routine that you love doing be it Zumba, yoga, going for a run, or dancing. Do it for at least 15 minutes every day and your body will love you!;
, Red more than any other color attracts a guy to a girl. Something about the color signals desirability and attraction. It will garner you much more attention than any other color.You can do this un-subtly by wearing a bright red dress, or you can do this more subtly by wearing red lipstick, or a red scarf, or red shoes.
Interestingly enough red makes men sexier, too, so this advice isn't just for a lady looking to attract a guy, but for a guy looking to attract a guy/lady as well., Dating can be a bit like looking for a job or marketing. This means you have to figure out how to draw that guy in through how you present yourself. This does not mean that you act other than who you are. Instead, it means that you show the best and the simplest sides of who you are.Make a list of your good qualities. If you find that you can't come up with very many (a lot of people can't, due to self-esteem issues) have a friend or family member you trust help you. As an example, your list might have things like: ""hilarious storyteller,"" ""good dancer,"" ""outgoing,"" ""helpful.""

, Pick three of the things you have on your list. This doesn't mean you sacrifice your complex individuality, but it is a shorthand way to present yourself to this guy in the beginning. If he's interested he'll start getting to know all your different sides. Using the above example you might present yourself as ""an outgoing dancer who loves a good story.""

This doesn't mean that you need to hide any part of who you are. If your favorite thing to do is dress up in Renaissance clothing and attend Ren Fairs, great! If he's into that sort of thing, too, then definitely bring it up. If you're less sure of his reaction, hold back that enjoyment until you've gotten to know one another better.

, The reason confidence is so attractive is that it shows how you feel about yourself and will clue other people into how they should feel about you. The worse you feel about yourself, the less likely other people are going to be attracted to you no matter how attractive you are!


If you're having difficulty being confident, fake it until it becomes natural to you. You can actually trick yourself into becoming confident by faking out your brain. Start with small confident steps(wear heels one day, put on that bright red lipstick) and begin working your way up to things like telling that guy you like how you feel about him.
Avoid comparing yourself to other people, especially to other ladies (if you're a lady). You will find in life that there's always going to be someone who is more attractive, more confident, with better relationships than you. If you focus on the good things about yourself and your life, you won't care that someone else is doing better than you.

, People love to talk about themselves. They love it even more if someone else seems interested in them. When you two are chatting make sure that you keep the conversation turned towards him. This means that instead of jumping in with something you want to say, you follow up what he just said with another question.


A good thing to remember is that the more intimate you get with one another in conversation, the stronger his attraction will likely be. Be willing to open up a little about yourself.
Don't let him completely hog the conversation, however. If you find that the ONLY thing he wants to talk about is himself, run away very fast. A guy like that is not going to be a good romantic partner and narcissism can be a sign of an abusive personality. Remember, your feelings and thoughts and life are important, too.

, Just like with girls, a guy's friends are important to him. They are also important to how he will end up feeling about you. If they don't like you, chances are they'll seek to influence their friend against you. If they do like you, they'll be on your side with the guy you like!


Make sure you get to know them. Ask them question about themselves and about their interests. When you see them around make sure that you ask them about the things that they told you, so it shows you're paying attention. For example: if his friends really like playing video games, ask them if they beat that high score they were looking to beat.
Again, it's good to remember that if they do nothing but talk about themselves, or ignore you when you have opinions and interests, you should be looking pretty hard at the kind of guy you're interested in.

, Interestingly, it seems that doing something that heightens his adrenaline actually makes him more attracted to you, especially if there was already some attraction building.


Excitement stimulates attraction, so if you get him excited (in a non-sexual way) you will also be more likely to heighten his attraction to you.
Some ideas for getting his adrenaline up and running: competitive board game/card game, playing pick-up soccer, watching a scary movie, going rock climbing, and so on.

, If you only do one of these steps, have it be this one. There is something about eye contact, especially prolonged eye contact, that ignites attraction and builds connection.Although prolonged eye contact seems like it might get a little uncomfortable after a while, don't stop. You'll blast right through uncomfortableness into connection.
For example: say you're chatting with your guy right before class. While you're both talking maintain eye contact with him. Not only will it show undivided attention it will give you both a little thrill.

, You may not realize how much your body is saying. Using a few simple little tricks will help enliven his interest. Try to add some of these subtly to your flirting or chatting when you're with him.Lean forward. People who are attracted lean into one another. Lower your voice and lean over the table, or towards him in the hallway.
Mirror his movements. People respond best to those that are like them. So do things like take a sip of a drink when he does, or mirror the way his hands are on the table. It's the little things he won't pick up on consciously, but will heighten his subconscious reaction to you.
Smile. There's nothing like a smile to pique someone's interest. This works particularly well if you add it to the maintained eye contact.

, There's nothing like humor to bring two people together. Poking gentle fun at one another can be a great way to flirt, and telling a funny story can show him how fun and laid back you are.


While everyone's humor is different telling a funny and true story can make almost anyone laugh. Tell your guy about the time that you took the wrong bus and ended up halfway across town, or the time when your father forget your name when he tried to introduce you to his colleagues. Make sure that you don't put yourself down when you're telling the story (like calling yourself ""stupid,"" or similar).
Having a verbal sparring match can heighten attraction on both sides. This means poking gentle fun at one another. For example, if you're playing cards you might poke fun at his choice of playing cards or make the funny claim that you're the best card player in the business so he can joke around with you if you lose.

, As your body language is helping to entice him, his body language will be telling you things on a subconscious level. This isn't an exact science, but it can be helpful to deciphering his moods and his feelings.A good sign is if he's leaning in to listen or talk to you, especially if he's speaking softly. This may mean that he wants his words to create an intimacy between you and doesn't want other people overhearing him.
A guy who touches you a lot is also someone who is likely interested. This could be something like touching you on the shoulder, or offering you his hand when you're climbing off something, putting his hand on your back to guide you through a crowd, and so on.
If he checks your reaction to things he does, that's a good sign of interest. This is especially true if he's done something really cool. He wants to see how you feel about what he's just done.
Good listening is also a definite sign of interest. If he listens when you talk, remembers the things you say, then there's a good chance he actually wants to be with you.

, Text, internet, Skype, these are all good ways to flirt with a guy you like. Now you want to make sure that flirting over social media is second to what you're doing when you're in person, but it can be a great way to keep his interest and remind him of you.


Send him a text about something you saw and that made you think of him. This is especially awesome if it's a picture (especially a funny picture). For example, if you saw a really fat squirrel you might take a picture and send it to him to remind of his story about a squirrel stealing his lunch.
Above all, keep social media interactions short. Don't obsessively text or Facebook him all day. Send him a couple messages that show that you're thinking of him and then get on with your daily business. It'll make you more alluring in the long run.

, If the two of you have been flirting and hanging out and you feel there might be a spark, the best and most mature thing to do is to tell him. The worst that could happen is that he won't feel the same way, but at least you'll know. You'll also know that you were brave enough to try to that's huge!


Talk to him in person and make sure that you are alone. You don't want an audience, especially if he doesn't feel the same way, but you also don't want to place that kind of pressure on him.
Say something like ""I've really enjoying hanging out with you for the past months and I feel like there's a kind of connection growing between us. I'd really like to have an actual date and see if things progress from there. How would you feel about that?""

, If he does respond well to your overture then you want to make sure that you keep things calm. Rushing right in through all the different parts of a relationship can be heady, but it can also make things run their course sooner or get too overwhelming.


Remember not to have sex on your first date. It can be a good idea to hold off for a bit. Sex complicates things and, especially if the guy is a friend of yours, you want to make sure that the relationship is really what you both want before it gets too complicated.
This will also give you a chance to consider whether you really want to be with him. Relationships rarely end up how you think they're going to end up and you'll need to adjust to the reality. You will also need to consider whether you're interested in this guy because you want a boyfriend, any boyfriend, rather than this boy in particular.

, A really, incredibly important part of getting him attracted and keeping him attracted is to do things on your own. Have nights out with your friends that don't include significant others, do fun things by yourself. You'll show that you know how to have a good time and that you aren't clingy.


Avoid dropping everything and hanging out with him every single time he asks. You want to be available for hanging out, but you also want to have a life. Show that while you love hanging out with him you do have other things in your life that you enjoy as well.
Remember to be happy with yourself. Do things that you love, try out new experiences. People who are happy attract others to them because they want a piece of that happiness. It doesn't mean you need to fake happiness if you aren't happy, it means that you should cultivate a life in which you are happy.

, Having too many expectations for the guy and for the potential relationship is a surefire way to foul it up. Going into a relationship with your entire future planned out with this guy places way too many expectations on him. He's likely to feel overwhelmed which won't bode well for the future.


For example: If you both have just started to take your relationship further, you don't immediately want to think about things like marriage, moving in together, or even saying ""I love you."" Wait awhile, at least until the honeymoon phase is over (typically at the end of three months) before trying to get really serious.
There's nothing wrong with daydreams about where the relationship could lead, but forcing the relationship to follow that narrow path without letting it grow as it needs to grow will kill it.

, People like to be noticed and they like it when others show that their efforts aren't being wasted. When you show that you appreciate him, it will make you more likely to ignite interest in him.


Thank him when he does something awesome or helpful. For example: if he always takes you to school in his car, bake him some cookies and tell him it's for always being on time (you might even make a joke and thank him for being your chauffeur if you think that would go down well).
Tell him what he means to you. You don't have to confess your undying love, especially if you're not sure he reciprocates, but you could say something like ""It means so much to me that you've been helping me out with my math homework.""

Figure out your own mind first.,
Turn the list into a profile of what kind of mate you're looking for.,
Be aware of what other people tend to look for in a mate.,
Love yourself and your body.,
Start looking.,
Don't be too picky up front.,
Make a good first impression.,
Don't rush things and give the relationship plenty of time to unfold.,
Make sure you tell someone that you're looking for a long-term relationship from the onset.,
Do some reality checking as you get to know your date better.,
Don't settle for less than ideal!",How to Find the Ideal Mate," The first step to finding your ideal mate is a paper and a pen. No, you're not going to write a personal ad. What you are going to do is list your traits and the traits you desire in a mate. Included in this list should be: your personality traits and those of a desired mate, your physical traits, and the desired physical traits your mate will have, as well as interests and hobbies, religion and beliefs (both yours and if your mate must be the same religion or hold a similar belief system or lack thereof), desire for children and your willingness to accept another's children, your communication style, etc. You may want to draw on the help of your friends for the personality portion, as well as your past relationships. If you take a look over this, it'll be easier for you to recognize what personality types you got along with the best.;
, This is a skeleton of a person. It should not be a list of demands, but rather a basic outline of the soul you're looking for. The list needs to be realistic and prioritized.


By looking at the profile, you will see what aspects are important to you that you may not have realized before. For example, suppose you like being outdoors, and exercising, then look for a hiking group - perhaps at a religious group, community group, or a local outdoors club like the Sierra Club.






Although you don't have to have everything in common with someone, it's a good start to find someone who has some things in common.







, Since there are numerous studies on what men and women look for in a mate, make use of them so that you can understand what others are looking for. This can allow you to emphasize your strengths in whichever area, to signal clearly that you've got the interesting traits, beliefs, or do the activities that your potential mate is looking for. Some of the most popular things men and women look for in one another are:


Women are looking for (in order): Personality, sense of humor, common interests, intelligence, cleanliness, looks, sexiness, getting to know the man through a friend, voice, spirituality, profession, money, talent, and finally, religion.Men are looking for: Personality, sense of humor, intelligence, common interests, looks, cleanliness, sexiness, voice, talent, spirituality, money, religion, getting to know the woman through a friend, and finally, profession., This is hot tip of the century; your ideal mate is going to be the person that loves you as you are and sees that you do too. If you cannot come to terms with this reality, then some confidence-building is in order and the mentality of wanting to fall in line with whatever your date says has to go out the window. Things to bear in mind to help you on your quest for the ideal mate include:


You're worth it. Yes, you really are. And prove it by walking tall, with your head held high, smiling and feeling confident. That's attractive and it's going to let potential mates see that you're approachable as well as self-confident.






List all the things that are great about yourself – why you make a great friend, what your top 10 accomplishments are, what you're proud of in life, and why you're a great catch.Dress to look good, not to fit the fashion, the label, or worst of all, the size on the tag. Whether you're male or female, good dressing that makes the most of your assets is always attractive and sets you apart from other people.






Be comfortable with your body. It's much more attractive than constantly sending out signals that you're paranoid about your butt size or your wimpy arms.







, Find social groups and events where your mate might spend time, and where there are likely to be plenty of conversations with each of the people involved. It's very important that you put yourself where you're likely to find your ideal mate instead of hoping that that person is the next one to sit down on the bar stool beside yours. The best places to look for your ideal mate are at places where you enjoy spending time, as it's likely that this first shared interest will get things started. Places to spend time looking for your ideal mate include:



Singles groups. These could be groups in local churches, dating services, or online. They're the most obvious source because everyone has outwardly declared that they're searching for someone, and while they have their pitfalls, the good thing is that everyone is there for the same purpose. You may find that your perfect mate on the hiking trip is married, or that there are no potential spouses in the auto detailing club, whereas singles groups are guaranteed singleness at least!






Hobby and sports clubs. You will need to know the relationship status of others in these environs of course but if you're participating in something you're enjoying doing anyway, what's the rush? You've plenty of chances to find out about the other people there and work out who is free and of interest to you, all while pursuing a hobby, sport, or other interest. The fact of the shared interest will likely increase your chances of compatibility.






The workplace. You'll know very early on in a workplace who is single and who is not. The downside is the continued proximity and the wagging tongues; it can also be harder down the track if you're both in the same workplace, married, and going for the same promotion but that's something to contend with later on. A shared career path can actually be really beneficial for some couples and does mean that you're ideal mates.






On vacation. This is a great time to find people who are in their relaxed mode. The downside is that they might live and/or work nowhere near you, and they might just be in it for a ""holiday fling"". Do some question asking before falling for someone on vacation.







, You're not configuring a laptop--you and your future mate are both looking for (or at least open to) someone to get to know and make happy. Get to know lots of people in various contexts casually, with a view to a few core attributes and broadly compatible personalities.Keep an open mind to the little details that you and that special someone can improve or compromise on and not worry about later.


If you persistently demand a precise combination of attributes up front, you'll probably fail to find it, maybe even drive off someone you would like with your fussiness, and finally, jaded, settle for a relationship not off to a good start for either of you and perhaps awkwardly late for a family..






In particular, don't worry about the finer points of looks: as with a nice car you've had for a while, you won't notice the details over time but just fondly recognize them overall.







, Dress and present yourself well when you start flirting and dating. People do make judgments based on initial appearances and it might be the only chance you get to make a difference. Good grooming, pleasant manners, and making the most of yourself are important aspects of maintaining your attractiveness.


Use that sense of humor. Both men and women cite this trait as very important and there's good reason for it. Humor is what helps to reduce the whole awkwardness of dating and it also lets both of you know that you're humble and not full of yourself. More to the point, a person with a sense of humor is definitely the preferable choice for a lifelong commitment over a grouch!







, When you find someone who seems to fit the profile, take a deep breath and go slowly! Spend a lot of time talking, listening, and seeing different aspects of this person you care about. Of course, you want there to be attraction, but you want to get to know this person as well. And you want to see how you interact in a range of situations, such as at leisure, during stressful periods, being around family, and in professional situations.


Put off intimacy for a while - depending on your religious beliefs and age, this may not be a choice but even if not, delaying intimacy can help reassure you that you're with your ideal mate, rather than experiencing an infatuation. The excitement and attraction in new relationships can override getting to know each other if you give into it too soon. Affection can feel a lot like love initially, so make sure of your heart and mind before you indulge in intimacy.






Use the dating time to test out your mate's reactions to activities and pastimes that you enjoy. If they get involved in a lot of things that interest you, this is a great sign of possible compatibility. Suggest a range of different things of interest to you, and also do things of interest to your date, and see how their level of enthusiasm (or lack of it) leaves you feeling. Also ask yourself if you really enjoy doing the things they suggest; if you're going to spend the next 40 years going to the same horse shows your date loves but that you can't stand now, you'll need to resolve how to manage that early on! Compromises can be reached but better that they're made before you take any serious plunges into lifelong commitment than ending up arguing about such things once you're married.







, The worst thing you could do to yourself is fall in love with someone who hits the road three months later because they're not ready to settle down. You should tell someone you are looking for a relationship after the first few dates (it's a bit desperate to discuss this on the first date!), or as soon as you know you're interested in this person. Don't be in a rush to commit; just make sure you're both on the same page. Let them know that's all you're doing. And bear in mind that you need to use your common sense when sounding out commitment issues; after all, nobody wants to discuss marriage on the second date!

, As the relationship evolves and you're becoming closer, how do you know that this person is ""the one""? Love can leave you giddy and can lead you to overlook the ""little things"" that can actually be rather big things once you try spending your life together. Things to find out before you're ready to declare this person your ""ideal mate"" include:


Are they moody or do they hide things from you that you should reasonably expect to know?






Are there money issues? Financial disparity and financial problems can cause you a lot of heartache, so honesty on this point is a must.






Do you enjoy spending time together for long periods?






How does your date act around his/her own family and your family? Are they respectful, disdainful, interested, switched off? Is their responsiveness an issue for you?






Do they seem to have the same mind as you about having or not having kids, about pursuing a career, about volunteering overseas for five years? All of these things matter!







, If you discover this is not the right person for you, don't hang on to them or convince yourself it'll get better or you're being too picky. You know what you want in a mate (you've already listed it above). You'll find it too. And when you do, it will be great! But on the other hand, don't be a perfectionist and demand impossibly high standards of the other person. Try to appreciate quirks but not settle for someone you will not be happy with.

Know the company policy.,
Have a conversation in private.,
Spend some time together.,
Take it slow.,
Date your peers.,
Date those who are available.",How to Date a Co Worker1," Before you ask out your coworker, you should first be aware of the company policy. Many companies have a strict no-fraternizing policy, banning romantic relationships within the company. Others are much more lenient, requiring only that you inform your supervisor.If you love your job and want to keep it, and your company forbids relationships between coworkers, consider dating someone from outside of your job.;
, If you want to ask your coworker out, be sure to do so out of earshot of others. Pull them aside or ask them to go for a walk or to lunch with you. Ask them if they would consider going on a date with you. Reassure them that they have time to consider it given the trickiness that a relationship could bring.


You might say something like “Sally, I know that we work together, but I really like you. I’m hoping you’ll go out with me this weekend if you’re free. I know this could potentially put us in an awkward situation, so I understand if your answer is no.”

, If they say yes, then spend some time alone with them outside of the office. Try to go to places that you know your coworkers or boss aren’t likely to go so that no one finds out before you are ready.

, If you break up with a coworker, know that you can’t avoid them like you might be able to do with other exes. Dating this person will mean that they are a part of both your professional and personal life. Avoid spending everyday together in the early stages until you know that this is a person you want to pursue wholeheartedly., If you are a supervisor, know that you are held to a higher standard and could potentially get into trouble if you date your subordinates. If you have the ability to fire or promote someone, then you should not date them. Date only those who you do not supervise at your job., If you know that the person you are interested in has a spouse or significant other, do not pursue them. If they have also dated others in the office in the past, it is probably best not to date them, as this could create some jealousy. Find out this information by asking your coworkers covertly, checking their social media accounts, or noticing wedding rings or pictures of spouses on their desk.


You can ask your coworkers questions like “So I know Marsha and Ashley and Jim and Marissa started dating while working here. Do you know of anyone else who dates or has dated here in the office?”

",How to Find Someone to Date at the Bookstore," You might like to start with a bookstore of a decent size so that you don't have the bookseller and everyone else listening to your dating overtures when you clap eyes on someone. Then again, some of the smaller more specialist bookstores might have the very person for you if they stock those comics, sci-fi or poetry books that you're really into – it's a good sign the person of your dreams will also like those very things too. Perhaps try a mixture of different bookstores rather than tying yourself down to one; it's really about being more alert for date possibilities when you're in the bookstore, so the size of the store might not make much difference as long as the place actually has patrons!

A bookstore with a cafe can have an edge over one without because you can always suggest the two of you have a coffee. However, a bookstore with a cafe close by will also work.






Find a bookstore that is open longer hours or during the weekends. You'll probably be better off looking for potential dates when people are in down mode than rushing about at lunchtime or at peak home time. Then again, more people means more possibilities!





;
, There are several ways to approach this and you might like to try them all in turn to see what works for you. Most of all, you'll need both patience and tenacity because picking up someone in a bookstore isn't necessarily going to be easy!


Hang around the area of books that you enjoy reading. If you spot someone you fancy enjoying books you fancy, there might be a match made in heaven.
Lurk near the magazine section. People are easily attracted to the magazine section, especially if there is seating nearby. This area can be rife with excuses for opening a conversation such as ""Could you please pass me that magazine you're in front of?"" to ""I can't find the last copy of ""X"" - oh look! You've got it! Would you mind awfully if I looked at page 20?""
Check out the cafe. Cafes in bookstores are a boon because people usually settle in for at least one drink and a leisurely read of a book or even a pile of books that they've collected in the store. You have a lot of opportunities to sidle up and ask if the seat is free, then start discussing the merits of the book or books on the table.
Sit in seating areas of the store. People are at their most relaxed when seated and reading and this can be an excellent opportunity to ask them about their reading matter and casually engage them in conversation.
Staff counters or staff putting away books on shelves. Don't discount the possibility of your new love being one of the staff! Just be sure that when you're trying to charm them that you don't take up too much of their time – you don't want to get them in trouble and you can always suggest the two of you meet up when it's knock-off work time.

, You can't be sure of their relationship status just by looking unless there is an evident wedding ring. If you see a ring, clearly you'll need to back off. If you see a girlfriend or boyfriend hovering nearby, you've been warned! Otherwise, there is no harm probing for relationship status as you continue your chat with this person.


Read How to ask a person if they're single for more details. Some people are so bold as to still ask even if they discover someone is dating already – read How to ask a girl out if she is already dating for more ideas.

, You're in a bookstore, so the list of potential chat topics is as wide as the book subject matter in the store. However, initially you need to get that person's attention. Here are some suggestions:


Casually stand near the person and look over at them every now and then. Gauge whether or not they've noticed you and if they seem to be looking back.
Find ways of interrupting them, such as pretending that you're looking for a book and asking them if they've seen it on the shelf. Or, drop a book near their feet and apologize profusely as they bend to pick it up for you. Or, spot a book in front of them and ask if they mind passing it to you.
Comment on what they're looking at, especially if you're aware of what it's about. With any luck, you may have read it yourself or know enough about it or the author/genre to start a good conversation about it.
Seek to appear friendly and knowledgeable about the book, genre, author or even the store, without coming across as annoying. Offer some good advice about their read and perhaps additional advice about books you'd recommend.

, Make it seem that you're extra keen to pursue the conversation on the topics you've raised and that your targeted person seems genuinely interested in. If you're lucky, the other person will agree to further discussion over coffee and you can start getting to know one another more.


Don't forget to ask for their contact details at the end of your coffee. Suggest that it'd be great to meet up again to compare notes on what the other person thought about the book, etc.
Even if you don't manage to have a coffee together, you can still suggest that the two of you get in touch again later, perhaps through email, Facebook, etc., to discuss the reading and to keep in touch.

, As with any potential date, you need to be conscious of the other person's level of responsiveness. If it's clear that you're crowding them out and bothering them, leave things where they stand and don't pressure the other person any further. On the other hand, if you're certain that there's a spark of interest and a willingness to continue the tango of getting to know one another, go with the flow!


Even if they don't want to catch up with you again, thank them for the discussion and wish them well. Not everyone is thrilled at the thought of being checked out when they're pursuing quiet intellectual time in their own head space and you need to take into account that they may just want to be left alone.

, If at first you don't succeed, try with different people who appear interesting to you and try in different bookstores. While a bookstore isn't a place high on the list of ""where to find dates"", the fact that the people in them clearly like reading and have similar interests to your own does make this a worthwhile way to try to find a date. If you're persistent enough, even if you don't find a love interest, it's always possible that you just might make a new friend.

Try to steer the conversations away from work talk.It may be a bad idea to ask a doctor, ""How was your day?"" Opt for another conversation starter. Ask about a TV show you both like, or discuss news about mutual friends.
Do not go overboard, however. If you partner had a stressful day, he or she may need to talk about it. On occasion, allow your partner to rant about work-related stress. Strive to be understanding and a good listener.

, Doctors are frequently hungry. When working long shifts and managing multiple patients, meals are often neglected. If you know your partner is working a long shift, plan a date that revolves around eating.It can be a nice gesture to have food ready when your partner is expected to come home. Order takeout and have it ready or make a home cooked meal.

, Doctors need to be on call all the time during certain hours. Your partner may have patients who are very sick or may be on call at a local hospital. It's important to be understanding of work obligations. While it's often considered bad etiquette to have your cell phone out at the dinner table, be understanding. When you're dating a doctor, rules about courtesy change., If you're dating a doctor, you'll end up spending a lot of nights alone. You will not be able to get universal attention. There may be many long nights when you'll have to entertain yourself.Hang out with your friends. If your boyfriend or girlfriend can't entertain you on weekend nights, make plans with friends instead.
Find hobbies you enjoy. Take up a craft like knitting. Start reading books in your spare time.
You can learn to enjoy alone time. You may learn more about yourself and your passions with the free time you gain by dating a doctor.

, Doctors have a high stress work atmosphere. You should plan on helping your partner de-stress after work periodically. If stress is unrecognized, it can cause tension in a relationship. Learn to watch for warning signs of stress so you can effectively address the issue.If your partner is stressed, he or she may seem a little cranky. Your partner may seem somewhat withdrawn and may be quicker to anger and somewhat moody.
If you suspect your partner is experiencing stress, try not to react with anger. Calmly say something like, ""Is there something bothering you? Is there any way I can help you feel better?""

, If someone is in a bad mood, you may be inclined to give advice. However, when helping someone cope with stress, it's always best to start with comfort. Advice, especially unsolicited advice, can come off the wrong way even if you have positive intentions.Try to be understanding. Actively listen to what your partner has to say, and offer apologies for the fact he or she is feeling this way. Reassure him or her you're there, and that you care.
If there is an issue that needs solving, you can get to that later. After offering initial comfort, think about ways to problem solve. Be clear that you're working with your partner. Explain you're not trying to tell him of her what to do, but want to brainstorm ideas to effectively work through the issue.

, Especially early in a relationship, you may not know how someone prefers to be comforted. Ask your partner what you can do when he or she is experiencing stress. Listen to and respect his or her needs.Ask how you can make your partner's days a little smoother. It may be something as simple as chipping in with some chores now and then.
Understand your partner's needs may be different from yours. He or she may handle stress in a way that's different from how you handle stress. Remember that different is not bad. Respect your partner's needs.

, It's important to be proactive when dating a doctor in regards to stress. Doctors face an inordinate amount of stress in their careers, so it's vital that you help your partner de-stress. Plan activities that can reduce stress.Sometimes, distraction is key. Plan for a movie night at the end of a long day, or to marathon watch a TV show you both love.
Suggest you and your practice stress reducing activities like meditation and yoga together.

, Exercise is a great way to reduce stress. Getting in regular physical activity can really help with your relationship with your partner. Think about planning hiking dates, or taking trips to the gym together., In a relationship with a doctor, you are not the priority much of the time. Your partner's patients will always come before you, as they are reliant on your partner for their physical wellbeing. Strive to be understanding of this fact.Your partner's patients may become suddenly ill. In the event of a medical emergency, the patient will come first. While you may be frustrated by this at times, remind yourself this is what you signed up for by getting involved with a doctor.
Try and think about the patients when you feel frustrated. While you may want to see your partner, they're undergoing stressful medical procedures and potentially serious conditions.

, Dating a doctor can get frustrating at times, but remember the pros. Doctors are usually intelligent and committed to their patients. Many doctors are very empathetic, and have a true passion for what they do. Not to mention, you got involved with this specific person for a reason. Try to remember what initially drew you to this person, and why the relationship is worth it for you.

, Patience is important when dating a doctor. You do not know what the schedule will be like on any given day, and it can be frustrating to always have plans in flux. However, strive for pride over frustration. Remember, your partner is doing something that he or she deeply cares about. You should be proud of his or her ambition and encourage his or her passions., You may not have time for epic date nights when dating a doctor. Try to value the small moments instead. Plan for light, flexible dates and be thankful for the time you have together.Allow for some simple rituals, like watching the sunrise together each morning.
Plan brief dates, like running to the store together or having a picnic.
Appreciate when you spend time together. Turn off your phone and eliminate distractions. Focus solely on enjoying your partner's company.

Be where the princes are.,
Don't lose yourself in the quest for his love.,
Give him subtle implications of your affection.,
Be an elegant lady.,
Find your common interests.,
Let your inner beauty shine.",How to Date a Prince," We all know that your chances of finding a prince skimming through the grocery aisle or cruising eHarmony are pretty slim, so the first step to finding your charming is to be where the princes are. Do a little research — Wikipedia can be your best friend. Find out where your favorite princes tend to be and land yourself there, too. Let’s start with the basics:


You need to be in countries with eligible princes, like Dubai, England, Germany, Monaco, or more. If you can't afford the plane ride over, a lot of princes go to school, live in, or frequently visit New York City, so start running in some high society circles.

Charities. Many princes not only have a lot of money but have the responsibility and power to set a good example for their nation, like Prince Harry who has spent time building a school for children in Lesotho. Check any prince's Wikipedia and you'll most likely find charity work. Having a passionate cause can put you in the same place as your prince — and can also help the rest of the world.
Schools. Young princes go to classy schools, so if you're in the same school, you're set. And if movies have taught us anything, the way to a prince's heart is through his physics class.;
, The shining armor from your knight can definitely be blinding at times, and you will be very tempted to put all of your energy into your quest because, well, you’ll be around a prince! Keep these in mind when you feel a little consumed.


Stay true to your passions. You have more interests than just capturing your charming, and along the way you don’t want to miss important opportunities! Besides, princesses can be interesting and multi-dimensional. Like Princess Sirivannavari, she’s Thai royalty and a fashion designer whose line debuted in Paris!
Get a hobby. Getting a hobby can not only help you develop and encourage your own personality but could be the key in striking common ground or meeting up with His Royal Highness. Queen Letizia of Spain was already a prime-time celebrity and met King Felipe of Spain while reporting on an oil spill. Princess Mette-Marit met Prince Haakon at a rock concert.
If you’re always stressing about whether or not this boy is noticing you, you’re going to be a royal wreck when he finally sees you. Be independent and self-contained.

, Subtle means just that: subtle. So put away your blow horns and hand-painted “Marry Me Harry” posters, it’s time to play the game. This step is particularly tricky with princes as opposed to other types of guys, because there’s a fine line you have to walk. On the one hand, you have to stand out from all the other girls vying for his affections, so playing hard to get might just get you unnoticed. On the other hand, you don’t want to come off as just another prince-chaser! After you’ve made contact with your beloved, keep these in mind:



Be casual, but polite. Being starstruck will not grant you any favors, but being rude is not becoming.
Drop consistent hints. Just one might not land. Princes are still guys, and guys are dense. Sending mixed signals is overrated.
Don't accidentally reveal all the information you have learned from him from your many hours of cyber stalking. You know when people talk to you and mention where you had lunch yesterday because they saw it on Facebook? Yeah, it’s weird.
Don't come on too strong while flirting, being overly aggressive will put him in an uncomfortable situation, especially in public. It doesn’t make you look too classy, either.

, We all know that in dating situations you should always be yourself, and that’s true. But one must keep in mind that princes run in royal circles, and are not only used to elegant ladies, but everyone else is used to them too, especially with the paparazzi. Yikes. No more spitting, rough-housing and tomfoolery. For the most part, you could probably get away with a mixture of common sense and all that useless stuff mother told you and you tried to repress, but for the rest, check out the basic etiquette rules for the situation and country. Each royal family usually has an etiquette web site or even hot line that you can contact to find the appropriate dress and conduct for the occasion.

, Just like it is with any guy, once you’ve got past the flirtatious hello's, you’re going to need something to talk about. Again, with princes, you’re in a different world. Do you both travel everywhere in an armored car shielding yourself from the paparazzi? Were you both raised in a family that had to adhere to the European monarchy and thus put a lot of pressure on you as a figurehead? Were you always picked on at school for only having one or two adjectives in front of your royal title? Whatever it is, find interests and passions you both share.

, This is the most important of all. No matter what you do on the outside, it's what's inside that counts. If you and your prince are truly meant to be, and a genuine match, just let your inner beauty shine and he will see you for the awesome lady you truly are.

Get her number.,
Pick a good time for your first text.,
Reintroduce yourself.,
Make small talk.,
Bow out early.,
Set up next time.,
Open with a compliment the second time (optional).",How to Call or Text a Girl1," This might seem like the hardest step, but it's necessary! If she gives you her number, you can safely assume that she's open to texting. Here are a few different tips on how to do it:



Don't get her number in a creepy way. You don't want to come off as a stalker, so try to avoid covert methods of getting her number. This includes getting it from her friends, finding it online, or any other sneaky means. Her phone number is private information, and she should have the right to give it to people she wants having it.
Find an excuse. Don't worry, she'll probably know it's a thin cover for getting her number, but she might be willing to give it to you anyway! If you're out with a group, ask for her number so everyone can coordinate plans. If you're in the same class, ask if you two can exchange numbers to keep up on homework assignments.
""Swap"" numbers. Give her your number, and then say ""And what's yours?"" or ""Sorry, I didn't get your number yet?""
Ask outright. If you don't have an excuse, don't sweat it — you can just ask. Stay casual, and start off with something like, ""Hey, could I text you sometime?"" or the basic ""Can I have your number?"" This should work well if you're wrapping up a fun date or some interaction that went well.;
, Text her too soon, and you'll seem desperate; wait too long, and you'll seem disinterested. When is the perfect time, then? There's no way to say precisely, but keep these pointers in mind:


Wait at least a day. Getting her number in the afternoon and texting her that night might seem too eager, and ""too eager"" sometimes translates to ""creepy"" for some girls. It'll be hard to wait it out, but try.
Pick a time when she's likely to text you back. Don't send your first attempt when she's probably at work or at school, and too distracted to text you back. Instead, aim for mid-evening, around 8ish, on weekdays. On the weekend, try any time of day except evening, when she might be out with friends.

, Don't just assume she'll automatically know who you are.


If you're already good acquaintances, your name should be enough, like ""Hey Brianna, this is John. How's your night going?  :)"".
If you just met her, you might need to provide some context, like ""Hey Brianna, this is John. I had a great time talking to you on Tuesday.""

, Texting is a perfect medium for small talk, so use it to your advantage! Don't worry too much about saying something really deep and interesting when you're first texting a girl — a willingness to engage in small talk and care about the mundane details of her life is enough for now.


Ask how her day went. It's that simple, and it could open up a whole conversation.
Bring up something you talked about last time you saw her. It could be an inside joke, a common interest, or simply picking up where a prior conversation left off.
Ask about her interests. Most people are comfortable talking about themselves, so make it easy for her by asking about what she likes. For instance, you might ask what she does in her spare time or if she has any hobbies. If you already know what she's interested in, ask her to tell you more about it. For instance, ""You said the other day that you ride horses, which I honestly know nothing about. I'd love to know more about why you like it.""

, Leaving before the conversation gets stale helps her maintain a good impression of you, and eases some of the stress of wondering what to talk about. As soon as you feel the conversation winding down, draw it to a graceful close.


Tell her you enjoyed texting her. As you leave, try to end the interaction on a positive note. Something like, ""This was awesome, I'd love to talk to you again.""

, Establish the expectation that you'll text her again as you end the conversation. Note that you want to know more about her interests next time you talk, or you're already looking forward to texting her again. A simple ""Maybe I'll talk to you again tomorrow?"" works, too.

, If your first texting session went well, go bold and try a compliment the second time. It's a quick way to both make her feel special and let her know you're interested.


Build it into the opening. ""Hey gorgeous"" is short, simple and to the point. Or, if you want to be fancy, you could try something like ""How's Tuesday going for my favorite girl?""

Get her number.,
Time it right.,
Relax.,
Practice good phone etiquette.,
Make casual small talk.,
Know when to end the call.,
Give it a few days before you call again.",How to Call or Text a Girl2," This might seem like the hardest step, but it's necessary! If she gives you her number, you can safely assume that she's open to talking. Here are a few different tips on how to do it:



Don't get her number in a creepy way. You don't want to come off as a stalker, so try to avoid covert methods of getting her number. This includes getting it from her friends, finding it online, or any other sneaky means.

, Timing can make all the difference between a good call and a bad call. Picking the right time can make you seem confident but interested, and up your odds of catching her at a convenient moment.


Wait a day or two. It's a fine line — if you call her too quickly, you'll seem desperate; if you call too late, you'll seem disinterested. Give her a day or two to wonder if you'll call her and build up interest.
Call in the evening. If you ring her up in the middle of the workday or when she might be at school, awkwardness will ensue — she'll be in a hurry to get off the phone, and it'll be hard for you to tell if she's interested or not. Instead, try calling her in the mid-evening, around 7 or 8 o'clock. She might be done with dinner and/or homework, and ready to chat for a bit.

, Before you pick up the phone, take a few deep breaths and try to calm down. Don't risk mumbling and stumbling over your words because you're nervous. Practice speaking at a reasonable pace and keeping your tone bright and clear.


Find some privacy. If you're really nervous, try to make the call from a secluded space. You'll be less worried about people overhearing what you say or ruining your concentration.

, How you respond to someone answering the phone says a lot about your manners and how nervous you are.


If someone other than her answers: Say ""Hello, is available?"" The other person might ask who's calling. To answer, you can simply state your name, or your name and some context (""This is John, I'm in her Spanish class."") If she's unavailable, handle it calmly and ask if you can leave your number for her to call back later.
When she answers: Say something along the lines of, ""Hey ! This is John, you gave me your number on Tuesday."" Reintroducing yourself like this might seem awkward, but it's an important step so that she knows, right away, who's calling.

, How her day went, homework, work, friends and her interests are perfect, easy topics to focus on. Don't worry too much about discussing deep, complex topics at first — what you really want to show her right now is that you're interested in what she thinks and getting to know her better.


Keep the conversation focused on her. Most people are comfortable talking about themselves because it's a topic they know well, so ask about her interests, what she thinks about something that happened recently, how her day went, and so on. Make it easy by asking about something you already know she likes, such as ""So I know you're into watercolors, which I would love to know more about.""
Ask about her day. She might need a willing ear to talk about something that happened.
Bring up something you talked about last time you saw her. It could be an inside joke, a common interest, or simply picking up where a prior conversation left off.

, It's much better for the call to be too short than too long - you don't want to bore her! Stopping the conversation while it's still lively and interesting can help you steer clear of awkward silences, and get her looking forward to next time. If at any time you hear 3 full seconds of clear silence, it's time to stop.


End with a compliment. Saying something like ""This was awesome! We should talk again sometime"" lets her know that you're not hanging up because of something she said wrong.

, As much as you might want to talk to her again as soon as possible, wait a bit. Expecting her to talk to you every single day implies a lot of pressure, since that level of closeness is usually reserved for people in serious relationships. But you can call her once or twice a week and see if she starts reciprocating by calling you!

Mark your territory.,





Avoid making the other twin feel like a third wheel.,





Focus on the ""main"" subject.,





Put your foot down on any tricks.,

Consider whether or not extreme closeness between twins is a problem for you or is something that you can live with.,
Avoid making assumptions about twins.",How to Date a Twin," Ask your twin date to stand out if you have trouble telling the two apart. Ask him or her to wear a specific necklace or hat, or something else that makes tasty humor. If that doesn't work or if he or she won't cooperate, distinguish and focus on a unique feature. Birthmarks, scars, and other features such as a laugh or twitch make each person different from another, including their twin.

Note that it won't take you very long when being around both twins to know who is who and to be able to tell them apart easily.;
, Twins usually have a better special bond than regular siblings.So when you come into the picture, the twin may feel guilty by leaving the other one behind or alone.







Instead of feeling like you need to be around the second twin all of the time, organize specific events to go on a double date, or create group get-togethers.
You might like to ask one of your friends to spend time with the other twin. He or she might even start dating one of them!






And when you're alone with the two of them, interrupt their physical closeness by putting yourself in between them.

, It's not wrong of you to be physically drawn to both of them. But your guy or girl probably doesn't appreciate you dabbling with and eyeing his or her double.

Remember to treat your twin date the same as a single birth person. What would be challenging, hurtful, or inappropriate in that situation remains the same for dating a twin.

, Some twins may think it's funny to play tricks on their significant other. Never stand for any of this.

One response to trickery might be: Secretly brand your beau with a mark without him or her knowing. Kiss his or her cheek while wearing that red lipstick, for example, put a small sticky dot on her top, or even give him/her a hickey. Then if he or she comes back without the mark, you'll know he's Tweedle-dum not Tweedle-dee and you can call an end to the pranking.
Or simply voice your dislike of any such pranking.

, Your presence won't break that bond, so learning to deal with it is your best strategy. If it doesn't work for you, that's a sign to draw the dating to an end.

As with any dating, check your own emotions and feelings about being with your twin date as a person in his or her own right.
Consider how many people of single birth have a problem with clearly defining who they are in life. If you wouldn't normally date a person who has issues with self boundaries, then your twin date's closeness with his or her twin will probably become a cause of concern for you.
If you find one twin is very protective of the other twin, even when you are around, and tells you to ""take care of my baby sister well, or else"", or ""treat my brother properly"", this could be a warning signal that the protectiveness will spoil your relationship. Talk to your twin date about it and decide how you feel after hearing the answers.
Constantly fighting over the presence of a twin in your dating life is a warning sign. If your twin tells you that their twin will always come first in their life, this signals that the twin hasn't managed to separate his or her needs and future journey from his or her twin. It might require more time, or you might consider moving on.

, Identical twins are still unique individuals and their interests, tastes, and hobbies may be very different from one another. As well, not all twins get along, or have an intense level of closeness, in just the same way that some single birth siblings don't get along well. The best thing to do when dating a twin is to put the assumptions aside and look to your own feelings about the twin you are dating."

Gauge her interest.,
Notice how often she touches you.,
Observe how she looks at you.,
Look directly at her.,
Help her out.,
Make sure you look and smell nice.,
Approach the girl you like.,
Keep the tone casual and fun.,
When the time is right, ask her for a date.,
Be confident.,
Be prepared for rejection.",How to Ask a Girl Out," Is she making eye contact with you? Is she smiling, laughing and having a good time talking to you? If so, you're on the right track. What if she keeps looking at you because she's annoyed with you always looking at her? This is not a good sign, and the girl might be a little stressed herself. Make sure to keep your feelings about her private, and not so obvious.;
, If she's constantly trying to touch your hand or finds excuses to do so, then she's probably interested. However, don't assume that she doesn't like you if she isn't touching you. Likewise, don't start touching her if she isn't making contact with you. This usually scares or intimidates girls. If she won't even look at you, stay calm and find excuses to talk to her.

, If she likes you, she will either hold your gaze for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these signs could mean that she likes you. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she doesn't like you, or she does like you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. If she's looking at you in a mean way, check your teeth. If she pulls away quickly, it could mean she is nervous but still likes you.


Remember that if you are having a conversation, girls tend to look at your face, so don't immediately assume that she likes you if you are speaking and she is simply listening. If you never talk to the girl, chances are you have a low chance of dating her. Friendships lead to love, but non-friendship leads to.... nothing.

, While talking, make sure to look at her face and specifically her eyes. Pay attention to what she is saying so that when she asks you something or stops talking, you can continue the conversation intelligently. Don't get caught staring at her body (especially her breasts). Very few women like this. If she doesn't look at you or she ignores you, back off, and leave her alone for a little. Some girls don't like looking boys in the eyes and talking. Read her body language.
, Offer to carry something heavy, get her lunch at the office, or do something nice for her. If she refuses, then wait until she really needs help or comforting, like when she's feeling down and having a bad day. Be friendly and outgoing to her. If she walks away quickly, don't follow her or say, ""What??"", just keep on going.

, You don't need to get decked out in a suit and tie to ask a girl out, but make sure your clothes are clean and well-fit, that you've brushed your teeth and are wearing deodorant. You should never ever wear the same clothes again, like you wear red sweatpants Monday, and then you wear them again on Tuesday.

, Don't worry about coming up with something overly clever. Simply say ""Hi"" or ""Hey."" As the conversation moves forward you can give her a complement or ask her a question.


If starting conversations is not your strong point, read these articles:
How to Talk to Strangers
How to Come Up with Good Conversation Topics



, Don't make the occasion seem like a big deal. Flirt a little! Relax, crack a joke, and break the touch barrier.

, Ask her to go the movies or something else you both would be interested in. You could also invite her out to happy hour at a bar you both enjoy. Try to make it original.


You might say: ""I heard about this movie, _______. What do you think about it?"" If she says she thinks it looks good, ask her if she'd like to go with you to see it. If she asks ""As in a date?"" say yes. Girls like guys who are sure of themselves much better than they do the cowardly guys.
Another thing you might say while keeping the tone casual is: ""I was going to check out this art opening on Saturday night. Do you want to go with me? I think it would be fun if we both went together.""

, If she questions if you're asking her on a date, say yes. Girls like guys who are sure of themselves.

, Keep your cool if she says no, smile and respond gracefully by saying, ""No problem! Maybe another time."" Change the conversation to something else or leave if you'd rather not hang around. Act as if you don't need her, because that sometimes will pique the interest of a girl. If she makes a face and yells, ""Oh my gosh, no way!"" this means that the girl is grossed out with you. Leave her alone and move on to another girl. Don't get your feelings too hurt though, this will leave you lifeless. Some girls just don't like this kind of stuff.

Decide what to do if you’ve been “friend zoned”.,
Don’t enable her to cheat on her boyfriend.,
Let her go if it's not working.",How to Ask a Girl Out if She Is Already Dating," If you are brave, ask her directly.She may suspect your motives if you ask her directly, so don’t choose this option if you want to keep your intentions a secret. Ask her casually: “Hey, I was wondering, do you have a boyfriend? I was just curious.”;
, If you’ve already felt comfortable enough to ask her if she’s dating, go ahead and ask her how serious the relationship is. If it’s serious, it might be harder to ask her out, but if it’s just a fling, she may still be interested in seeing you. Ask: “Is it a really serious relationship, or more casual?” Once again, she may know immediately where the conversation is going if you ask her specifically, so be careful.

, Be direct, but careful. Say: “How is your relationship with your boyfriend? Are you happy?” Be very cautious talking to her about this: she may become defensive or be offended that you’re asking about her private life. Her reaction will depend entirely on her personality, so gauge her answers from previous questions to see if she’ll respond well to really personal questions like this. If she seems uncomfortable being questioned, ask her friends or find some other way.

, Asking directly may be a little dangerous, because she may be offended if you ask her about her relationship. Personal questions may make her uncomfortable, and she may know exactly where you're going with your line of questions.Ask indirect questions. By asking her “What are you up to tonight?” Or “What do you like to do for fun?”, she may mention her boyfriend offhand and save you the trouble of having to ask directly.
Look for signs of flirting. While some girls are naturally flirty whether they're single or not, but if she seems into you, chances are higher that she's single. See how much you can flirt back. If she responds positively, she's probably single.
See what she shops for. If you're lucky enough to meet a girl in a store instead of at school or work, you may be able to get some clues from her shopping. Look for family size food items, items obviously for men, or baby products.

, Her friends will know a lot about her relationship and be able to help you out. While her friends may tell her that you’ve asked about her relationship, you’re more likely to be able to keep your intentions secret this way.


Ask her friends how serious the relationship is. Her friends will be able to give you a more impartial answer than she might. Friends see a relationship from the outside, so they may be able to give more valuable information about where her relationship with her boyfriend is going, and what kind of dating patterns she has.
Ask her friends if she’s happy. Asking her friends about her happiness may be better than asking her directly, because they’re likely to be less offended and have more impartial information on her relationship. They may spend a lot of time with her and her boyfriend, and they might see or hear about small fights or disagreements.

, While this method might make you feel a bit like you’re snooping, it is the easiest way to find out her relationship status without tipping your hand. Facebook profiles have a specific section for relationship status, while Instagram posts and Tweets might give you an idea about whether she’s single or not. Don’t get too discouraged by pictures of her with other people though. They may be old boyfriends or other close friends.See if she seems happy. Social media probably won’t be able to tell you how serious a relationship is, but it may give you important information about how happy her relationship is. Check her pages to see if she posts about fights or disagreements with her boyfriend. Be very careful to only use these as a gauge, not evidence. Don’t talk to her about specific posts that you saw, because she may think that you are snooping through her posts.

, Before you get too direct and ask her out, float a conversation about relationships in general. Start the conversation with normal small talk about her day or how she's doing, but then ask how her relationship is going. Relationships are a normal subject of conversation, so she shouldn't be too suspicious if you keep it light and friendly. Use this talk about relationships to bridge towards asking her out., If you find that she’s in a relationship but it’s either not serious or not very happy, try to be bold and ask her out. This method takes some guts, because you have no idea how she’ll react, or what the outcome will be like, but it’s worth it because she may say yes.Say: “Hey, I know that you’re in a relationship, but I get the feeling that it’s not serious/not going well. Would you want to go on a date with me? I promise not to make any moves or disrespect your relationship. I just want to get to know you better."" This method places emphasis on the quality of her relationship, and hints to her that you may be better for her.
For another angle, try saying: “I know this is really forward, and I know that you’re seeing someone already. But would you like to go on a date with me? I think you’re great.” This choice leaves out everything about the quality or seriousness of her relationship, and simply lets her know that you’re interested in her regardless of her relationship status.

, Make sure not to be too disparaging towards her boyfriend. Not only will this be questioning her taste in men, but if she has feelings for him, you could seriously offend her. Tell her that you know that she has a boyfriend, and that you don't want to get in the way if it's serious, but that you'd like to get to know her better.

, Instead of asking her out, try writing down your number and giving it to her. This makes your intentions pretty clear, but saves you the trouble of trying to find the perfect way to ask her out. You'll only have to pass her the number and tell her to call you sometime. She may get in touch with you when things get rocky with her boyfriend, or she may start texting or talking to you immediately to get to know you.

, Sometimes, you may not have to make the first move. If you start talking to a girl that you know has a boyfriend, she may still flirt with you or make it clear that she’s interested in you. In this case, let her bring up a date. Ask her: “Are you busy after school?” Or “When do you get off work?” These questions are open ended and allow her to propose a time for you to meet up and get to know each other., It's likely he'll be upset that you're trying to take his girlfriend, so prepare to apologize if necessary. If she decides to go out with you, he'll be even more upset. Try to avoid him, but if he comes to talk to you, apologize to him and explain that you have no intention of breaking up with her.

, Girls often like having male friends, so you need to make sure that you don’t end up more of a friend in her eyes than a potential boyfriend. If you spend time with her and she doesn’t break up with her boyfriend, chances are, she sees you as a friend and doesn’t want to date you. She may enjoy spending time with you, but that doesn’t mean that she is attracted to you.One signal of the friendzone is a lot of talk about feelings. If she starts contacting you frequently to talk about her feelings, or if she uses you as a sounding board to complain about her boyfriend, she most likely sees you as a friend.
Listen to how she talks about you. If she talks to her friends about you, but consistently mentions that you’re “just a friend,” or “just a good guy”, chances are, she is not interested in dating you.
See if she still flirts with you. If she flirts with you and seems genuinely interested, you may have a chance. But as time goes on and she flirts with you less and less without breaking it off with her boyfriend, you are most likely in the “friend zone”.
Break things off with her. If you are still interested in dating her but she sees you as a friend, break off the friendship. You will only get hurt if you end up as a third wheel. She can’t help who she is attracted to, and if only sees you as a friend, she’s unlikely to change her mind.
Stay friends with her. If you decide that you value her friendship more than a potential romantic relationship, it is okay to stay friends with her. It’s completely possible to have strong, healthy relationships with people of the opposite gender, but you’ll have to get comfortable with the fact that things will be just platonic.

, If the girl really likes you, but is in a serious relationship, she may be tempted to cheat on her boyfriend with you. Be clear with her that you won’t do anything with her unless she breaks it off with her current partner.


If she cheats on her boyfriend with you, this is a red flag that she could cheat on you if you ever end up together. Many people who cheat on their partners do so compulsively, and it may be impossible to trust them.
Don’t become a “side guy”. If her current relationship isn’t serious, but she still doesn’t want to break it off, you face the danger of being strung along. She may call you often or spend romantic time with you, but this will only lead to you getting hurt. She will most likely never commit to you or leave her relationship: she’ll just use you instead.

, If you’re really attracted to a girl, you may be tempted to ask her out a few times even if she’s got a boyfriend. However, you need to be realistic about your chances of success. If she continually reminds you that she has a boyfriend, or says no to offers for dates, you’ll only make her frustrated as time goes on. Remember that there are “more fish in the sea” and move on to other girls if things don’t develop.

Look for signs of attraction.,
Practice asking them beforehand.,
Imagine your own worst case scenario.,
Find the right time to ask.,
Tell your friend you want to ask them a question.,
Help your friend feel comfortable.,
Share your feelings first.,
Ask them directly.,
Listen to their response.,
Thank them for sharing, no matter the answer.,
Respect their decision.,
Continue nurturing your relationship.",How to Ask a Best Friend if They Like You," Before you ask, look for signs that they have a crush on you.At best, this will give you confidence as you prepare to ask them. At worst, you'll have a realistic idea of their feelings.


Watch for changes in your friendship. Does your friend act differently around you? Maybe they laugh more at your jokes or seem shyer. Significant changes in their behavior could mean they've developed feelings for you, especially if they seem nervous or excited.
If you're bad at reading the signs, ask a mutual friends! Have a conversation about your best friend with them. Casually ask if they know whether your friend likes anyone. Sometimes a second opinion offers an excellent perspective.
Unless you ask them, you can't know one way or the other. Don't assume you know for sure until you have talked to them.;
, Running through your plan before will save you from awkward moments later. If talking aloud helps, try practicing with a friend or in a mirror. Getting the words out can help you visualize the situation better.


Prepare for the various ways they might respond. What will you do if they say they like you? What if they don't? What if they refuse to respond? You don't have to be a mind reader, but work through multiple outcomes.

, Facing your fears before you ask them the question can save you stress and anxiety.Maybe they don't like you, they feel uncomfortable, or they don't want to be your friend anymore. Is asking them still worth it? If so, ask them anyways.


No matter what happens, you might feel relief after. Even if your worst case scenario happens, you'll know their answer for sure. Only you can decide whether the risk is worth it.

, Think about when and where you and your friend are together. Determine what circumstances would be ideal to ask them in. You will not want to ask them if they like you spontaneously.


Ask them out in person, if you can. While asking through a text or phone call can seem comfortable, you'll appear more sincere in person.
Where is just as important as when. Find a place that is quiet and secluded from other people. You'll both want to focus on the conversation and not those around you. If you see your friend at a loud or crowded place, walk with them to somewhere you can be alone before you ask.
Avoid asking them in front of their friends. Your friend may not feel ready to share their feelings with others and might not tell the truth.

, Once you've found the right place and time, let them know you want to talk to them about something that's been on your mind lately. If they say now is not a good time, respect their feelings and save the conversation for later. If they're ready to talk, go ahead!


For example, you could say, ""Hey, Emma, are you busy? I have a quick question for you. Could we chat for a second?""

, One-on-one conversations can be scary, especially when talking about feelings. If you have a natural sense of humor, crack jokes. If not, start with small talk and ease into the personal questions.Don't make a big deal when you steer towards the heart of the conversation. If you're visibly nervous, your best friend will also feel uneasy. Avoid putting unnecessary pressure on them.

, If you like them, tell them. If you can be open with them, they will be more open with you.In some cases, you may not feel attracted to your best friend and have other reasons for asking. In this case, do not lie as a means of getting information. Instead, tell them how meaningful your friendship is.
You might say, for example,""Tyler, I care about you a lot. Your friendship means so much to me. I'm glad we've gotten to know each other and that we spend so much time together.""

, When asking them who they like, you might attempt to beat around the bush. In this situation, you need to be blunt. Ask them if they like you and, if so, whether they want to be more than friends.


Let them know that you care about them unconditionally. They may worry that if they do not like you, you will abandon them. Tell them you are here for them, no matter what.
You could say something like, ""Riley, before I ask you this question, I want you to know that I care about you no matter what. Lately, I've noticed that our relationship has changed a little. I've wondered if you might like me more than a friend. Am I right in thinking this?""

, If you're nervous, you may feel overwhelmed. Push through the anxiety and pay attention to their response. Try not to color their response with your own emotions. Let them speak as long as they need to, and pay attention.


Active listening shows your friend that you really do care about them.Give them the courtesy to speak because you love them, even if their answer is disappointing.

, Your best friend may worry that you are only interested them romantically. If you do care for this person, show them that this isn't the case. Tell them that you appreciate their honesty and care about them a lot.

, Regardless of the answer, avoid questioning it. If they say they love you, tell them how you feel. If they do not, avoid making them feel bad or guilty.


After they answer, you may feel overwhelmed if they say no. Remember to practice beforehand to avoid freezing.

, Once you've finished the conversation, continue developing your relationship.If your friend likes you, decide how you want your relationship to change. If they don't, stay in touch and remain their friend.


After you ask, you may feel uncomfortable around them. It might take time for both of you to process this conversation. Give them time and space alone, if needed.
Sometimes asking can change the relationship in unintended ways. Romantic feelings are tricky, and your relationship might not be what it was before again. Prepare yourself beforehand, and know it's a risk you must take.

Give her a butterfly kiss.,
Try a forehead kiss.,
Do French kissing.",How to Spice up Kissing1," A butterfly kiss involves no tongue at all, or any mouth to mouth contact. Instead, you will use your eyelashes to “kiss” your partner.Bring your face very close to your partner’s face. Instruct her to close her eyes.
Flutter your eyelashes rapidly, moving over her cheeks, her mouth, her chin, and even her forehead. This will give her a pleasing, soft sensation on her face and get her more in the mood for mouth to mouth kissing.;
, This kiss is another good way to mix up your kissing routine and kiss your partner in an intimate and unique way.Lean forward and gently kiss your partner’s forehead, moving your lips slowly. Do not give a very wet kiss or a loud kiss. Instead, keep the kiss brief and sweet.

, French kissing is also known as “kissing with tongue”, and is considered one of the more sensual ways to kiss someone. Spice up your kissing technique by adding in some tongue action. Just make sure you have fresh breath before you attempt this.Start kissing your partner normally and then gently slide your tongue into her mouth. Only slide it in part way, using slow, gentle movements. Go slow and steady, as you do not want to jam your tongue into your partner’s mouth. This will be the opposite of sensual.
Once you feel comfortable with the basic French kiss, you can start to explore your partner’s tongue more with your tongue. You can move your tongue against her tongue, have them touch, or suck on her tongue with your mouth. Avoid moving your tongue over your partner’s teeth or gums, as this will feel more like a dental check up than a fun make out session.

Find a firm surface.,
Bend your head backwards slowly.,
Stop if you feel pain.,
Have someone lean in and kiss you.",How to Spiderman Kiss1," To hang upside down, you need a firm and reliable surface that can hold your weight. Ideally, pick something designed to hold the full weight of a human. A couch or a bed would work well, while tables may topple depending on their strength.


In addition to finding the right surface, put some padding down underneath to protect you if you fall.;
, Seated on the firm surface, bend your head over the edge. For safety, it's best to keep the rest of your body on the surface.

On a table, lie flat on the table on your back. Then, tilt your head over the edge.

Help him when you can.,

Maintain a healthy relationship.",How to Caress Your Boyfriend," If you have treated your boyfriend well and cared for him well, you have set yourself up well. Your boyfriend will appreciate your special touch even more when he knows that your emotions and heart are in it too. Find a special moment to caress your boyfriend, whether that's when you two are in an intimate moment, when he's saddened or upset by something, or in public when you can show others how much he means to you.;
, You may be tempted to caress your boyfriend during times of high stress or when you are in an argument, because you feel like it could soften the mood. However, when people are angry, many times their personal bubble expands, and they don't want to be touched or caressed. Watch for signs from your boyfriend to know if it is a good time to reach out and touch him.

If your boyfriend is acting like he wants space, or seems distant or aloof because he is angry or irritated with you, you might avoid caressing him. In those moments he may need a little bit of time to cool off and think through things. Reaching out and touching him could set him off even more or make him feel he needs an even greater distance.
If the two of you are at the end of a fight, and you aren't sure if it is a good time to touch your boyfriend, you can try asking him. Simply ask ""Is it okay if I hug you or hold you now?"" That way, you know if he's in a place where he wants to be near you.

, Some guys are very physical and enjoy physical touch, while others may show their love for someone in a different way. While dating your special guy, learn how he reacts to certain things and when he seems to want to be touched the most. Some guys appreciate a hug, caress, or massage in moments of high stress, while others want to escape to their thoughts.If you try to caress your boyfriend during a time when things don't seem perfectly okay, and he reacts negatively, try not to take it personally. Unless he always acts this way around you, he may just need his space or time to think and doesn't receive touch well during these times.
If your boyfriend never seems to like being caressed, or reacts rudely or harshly when you try to touch him, it may be a good time to talk to him about how you feel. You don't want to be dating someone who doesn't appreciate it when you touch him.

, If your guy has had a long week and looks like he needs to rest, or you just want an excuse to touch him, ask your boyfriend if you can give him a massage. He will likely say yes and it's your opportunity to help him relax; it can create intimacy between the two of you as well. For a really good massage, use coconut oil or other scented lotions to soothe his muscles.Ask him where he is experiencing the most tension and what feels the best. Your boyfriend will likely love a massage that caters to the areas in his body that need the most attention. After you have loosened him up a bit he may be more intimate with you, or willing to give you a massage.

, If you are looking to caress your boyfriend in hopes that it will lead to something more, find an excuse to touch his face. Brush the hair out of his face, touch his cheek, or gently hold his face in your hands for a few seconds. Your boyfriend will likely make eye contact with you and it may lead into something more, like a kiss.


Some of the best times to do a caress like this is when it is unexpected. Catch him off guard so that his attention is immediately drawn back to you.

, This is often the most gentle and sweetest way to caress your boyfriend, because it is such a light touch that shows him you are thinking about him. When you are in public or with friends, reach over and grab his hand, squeeze it, and let it go. Or, reach up and gently touch his shoulder or rub his back, letting him know you are thinking about him.Moments where your boyfriend seems upset, sad, or has experienced some sort of loss can be the sweetest times to caress him in this way. It gives him the space he may need to mourn or grieve, but lets him know that you are there for him and care for him., Show your man you care for him and/or love him by giving him a tender, long hug. Most guys enjoy the feeling of being up close to their significant other, and a hug can be a deep display of affection. Hug your boyfriend from behind and wrap your arms around his waist, or embrace him from the front and hold him tight. Sometimes a hug is all you need to make your day better, so why not make his better by greeting him with a full-body embrace.

, The greatest way to show your boyfriend you care about him is to reveal to him how much you appreciate him. Guys often want to feel needed and want to know that you appreciate them. Don't forget to remind him every now and then how much you do care for him and how thankful you are to have him around.

When you compliment your boyfriend and make him feel like the things he does for you aren't in vain, it can create positive effects in your life as well. If he feels like his significant other appreciates him and notices him, he may be more likely to do things for you, because he knows that you won't just ignore him or critique him.

, Compliments don't just affect women. Men like and enjoy compliments as well, so compliment him every now and then to boost his confidence and to show him you find him attractive in appearance and personality. Compliment his looks, but also compliment his actions. Let him know when he does something well or when you are proud of him.

In moments when your boyfriend is experiencing difficulty or has recently failed at something, take time to encourage him and remind him of his strengths and what he is good at. Uplifting your boyfriend in times when he is feeling insecure is one of the best ways to compliment him.

, Even in those moments when your boyfriend irritates you and the last thing you want to do is help him, sacrifice your pride and help him out. Taking time and energy to work alongside your boyfriend or to help ease his load is a great way to show your boyfriend you care for him and love him. A healthy relationship isn't based on what you can gain from someone, it's based on mutual support and affection.

Helping your boyfriend may look like different things. It may be running errands for him when his life gets crazy. It may be helping him with school work or his workload. It may be giving him space to sort things out. The best way to help you boyfriend is to do things without him having to ask first. This will show him that you aren't helping him out of obligation or helping him just because he asked -- you are doing it because you care about him enough to help him out.

, Along with complimenting your boyfriend, you can talk tenderly and sweetly to him to express your feelings and care for him. Tell him how you feel about him, try to avoid jumping to conclusions, and give your boyfriend grace when he needs it. Know that no one can be perfect, so even when your boyfriend makes a mistake or hurts your feelings, be willing to forgive him and give him grace.

Giving your boyfriend grace means not holding grudges against him, forgiving him, and showing him love, even when it is difficult. Showing someone grace can often be humbling, but it helps him see that you are understanding and know that you aren't perfect either.
This doesn't mean that you can let your boyfriend walk all over you, or continually mess up with no regard to your feelings. If your boyfriend continually hurts your or is constantly making mistakes, you should talk to him. Communication is key to a healthy relationship, so if you have given your boyfriend grace countless times and continue to forgive him, but his behavior still throws you off, it's time you have a conversation with him.

, The key to caring for your boyfriend is making it a priority to keep the relationship healthy. You may pretend like everything is okay by engaging in physical touch, but at the end of the day physical touch won't be enough. Communicate regularly with your boyfriend and make sure you two have created a safe place to share how you are feeling in the relationship.


For a healthy relationship you should avoid dating someone who doesn't seem that into you, or is only keeping you around until something ""better"" comes along. Dating someone who shares the same values as you do and is committed to you will result in the best relationship and the least amount of heartbreak."

Ask yourself what you admire in a man and how you want to enjoy the time you spend together. You might want to write a list of the things you desire and the things you aren’t willing to budge on, like kids or religion. Think about what kind of man you would like to build a future with.


If you’re currently with someone, be honest with yourself and see if you really feel good about your relationship or if you are waiting for something else deep inside.;
, Before you get married, make sure you are at a place where you are comfortable in who you are. Know your best qualities and the things you can improve upon. When choosing a man, find someone who makes you feel natural when together. Look for someone who brings out the best in you, such as your kindness and humor. You shouldn’t have to feel like you need to change to be good enough for them.You should feel comfortable expressing your thoughts and feelings openly to this person without fearing their judgment or ridicule.
If you feel pressure to be someone else or act a certain way to get their attention, this could be a bad sign.
Make sure that you are ready for a committed relationship. Evaluate where you are at this stage of life. Are you ready to get married now? In the next few years? Or are there things you want to accomplish before getting married? Do you know what you want well enough to get married yet?

, Think about your goals and what you want to do with your life. Then, ask yourself if he is going to support you and be a part of it. The man you marry should be the person that will help you to grow and be a better person in all fields. For example, if you want to live in another country, find a man who would support you and/or join you in that move.


Look for a man who will support you and encourage you to pursue your desires and dreams.

, If you’re dating a guy who says he probably doesn’t want to get married, it might be foolish to wait for him to come around. If you’re trying to find the right husband, make sure the guys you date want to get married. If your relationship is getting serious, ask about his future hopes and dreams. If he doesn’t include marriage in his answer, ask him about it.


If you’re waiting years for your boyfriend to come around, have a serious discussion and let him know what you want.
Do not be afraid to ask him this question, and do not put off asking because you are afraid of his answer. This is an important question. If you are serious about getting married someday, you should know if your significant other is on the same page or not.

, When it comes to compatibility, the most important thing is that you feel united in some way. It might be that you spend your free time in similar ways, share a hobby, or just enjoy being together. When you think about your partner, consider what items you want to connect on.Whether you both love camping or both already have children, make sure there’s at least one thing you can bond over with your potential spouse. Perhaps similar beliefs unite you or you both value family.

, Everyone has a different way of approaching problems in a relationship. Some people get angry and yell, others avoid, and still others handle conflict as it arises and compromise. It matters little which style you and your partner have, but more whether both of your styles are similar.Think about how you tend to approach conflict and find a man who has a similar or complementary approach. Even if his style is different than yours, you both should work well together to resolve conflict.
Resolving conflicts can help you understand each other better and not hold resentment toward each other.

, If religion matters greatly to you, find a partner who shares your beliefs. Marrying someone with different beliefs from you can affect your relationship and cause problems in the future, so think about how this might affect your potential marriage and family. If it’s imperative to you and your family that your husband share your same religion, you must either ask him to convert or break up. Talk openly about how religious differences will affect your relationship and potential children.Find common ground in your beliefs or values. Learn to accept their religion and learn about it., Consider how you approach money and find a man with a similar approach. If you tend to meticulously budget and save your money, find a man with similar values. Money can be a big problem and major source of conflict in a marriage, so pick up on a potential partner’s habits early on.Consider your values around keeping separate bank accounts or using a joint bank account. Have a plan for tackling debt, creating savings, and dividing money.

, Decide the role of family in your future marriage. If you want to be heavily involved in family life with your own family, choose a man with similar family values. Some people want little to do with their in-laws, while others spend lots of time together. Ideally, you want to at least feel welcome and accepted into his family and have him feel the same about yours.If you don’t have a great relationship with your own family and want to feel connected to your future husband’s family, look for a man who lives near his family and has a great relationship with his parents and siblings.

, Make sure you connect with your partner emotionally. You shouldn’t have to beg for your future husband’s attention, nor should you feel low on the list of people he wants to spend time with. You should feel like you get the attention you need and connect on an emotional level.Look for a man you can openly talk to and who makes you feel understood.
For example, people in a healthy emotional relationship will turn toward one another during times of hardship and in times of celebration.

, Talk about his friendships and his relationship with his family. Look for a man who is capable of holding long-term relationships and has life-long friends. Notice how he navigates his relationships: see how he handles conflicts, shows support, and gets involved with the people he loves.If he has lots of conflicts in his relationships or has cut off friends or family members, ask about what led to these actions and why they have happened repeatedly.

, The person you marry may not be the same person in 5, 10, or 50 years. Both you and he will change, so ready yourself. Both of you will likely make changes in your lives physically, mentally and emotionally. If you become parents or go through other major life changes, make it a goal to change together, not apart.


If you’re looking for the right man, see if he can be flexible with changes and turn toward you and not away from you. Notice how he responds to changes in his life and ask yourself how he would do in the long-term.

, While you want to find the right man, be the right partner in the relationship for your future husband. It’s easy to blame someone for what’s going wrong in your relationship. However, you cannot change someone, you can only change yourself. If you frame a person into being the “right” or “wrong” man, it misses consideration of your part in the relationship. You alone are responsible for the relationship you want.Take responsibility for your own feelings without blaming your partner, and notice if he does this, too. If you feel frustrated, speak up or do something to change things on your own initiative.

, Recognize from the start that you will not marry a perfect man. He has flaws and he will trigger you. Before you get married, make sure you have some awareness of the things that annoy you or bother you. You might get annoyed by home life things (like a messy man) or lifestyle things (like a man who spends a lot of time with friends). Know what things bother you or annoy you and don’t plan on them magically disappearing when you get married. More likely, they will magnify.Accept that there will be lots of things you disagree on. Be ready to accept him as he is without feeling the need to change him.
Accept that you have flaws, too. Be ready for them to come to light.

, If you fall in love with someone yet some big problems already exist, like a drinking or drug problem, halt your feelings for a bit. Step outside of your emotions and step into a more rational mindset. Ask yourself if there are things that you’re avoiding or overlooking that are important to acknowledge. If you’re hoping problems will magically work themselves out, be realistic in how they might actually turn out.Don’t expect things to get better. For example, if the man is violent or has an addiction, don’t expect him to change just because you might get married. Be cautious.

Decide which traits your ideal partner needs to have, and which ones you could live without.For instance, you might decide your future partner needs to be trustworthy, kind, and emotionally stable.
Take your own personality and values into consideration. Most people do best with a partner who is at least somewhat similar to them.

, Imagine spending an ordinary day with your ideal partner. Think about what kinds of things you would enjoy doing together. Ask yourself how much you’re willing to alter your current lifestyle for your future partner.For instance, if you love going hiking and camping on the weekends, you would probably want to seek out a partner who likes the outdoors.

, It can be fun to make lists of “must-haves” in a future partner, but if you get too invested in your wish list, you might miss out on a great relationship. Focus on how you get along with potential partners in real life, not how well-matched you are on paper.If you must make a list, focus on just a few of the values or traits that are most important to you.

, If you insist on only seeing people who look a specific way or have a certain kind of job, you could be overlooking others who would make excellent partners.Expanding your social circle will give you the opportunity to meet more types of people.

However, if you’re not sure whether you like someone or not, going on another date or two can help you figure out how you feel.

, If you have a bad feeling about a developing relationship, it’s a good idea to slow things down or break the relationship off entirely.

You may be able to come to a compromise. You may also save yourself some time by figuring out that the relationship isn’t going anywhere.

, If you seek out a relationship just for the sake of not being single anymore, you might end up unhappy with the partner you picked. Take your time and think about your future happiness, not just the way you feel right now.Consider that you might be happier single than you would with a poorly-matched partner.

, You can ensure you find the right match by being open and straightforward about your needs in the relationship. Communicating your values, goals, and future priorities early on can help you figure out if your partner is right for you. Also, be willing to listen to and acknowledge your partner's needs.For example, if finishing your graduate degree is important, you will need to convey this to your partner.
Relationships require compromise, so you shouldn't express these as if they are a list of ultimatums. However, your partner should be willing to have a discussion with you so that you can reach goals and priorities that align with both your needs.

You trust one another
You respect one another's differences
You both maintain your own identities in the relationship

, Hugging can be an effective way to start caressing a girl and hugging is a common practice in new relationships. You can give the girl a hug and begin caressing her as you do so to prolong the hug and make her feel good.


Try hugging her as you say goodbye for the night and then gently stroke her back with one hand as you hug her. If she seems to like this, then you might reach up to her face with your other hand and gently stroke the side of her cheek.
If she keeps the hug quick and friendly, then perhaps she isn't interested. If she tries to make the hug last longer, then perhaps she's interested in having more physical connection with you.

, You can also place your arm around a girl’s shoulders or waist to start caressing her. You may only want to try this if you're pretty sure she will like it and have already done things like hold hands.


For example, you might gently place your arm around her shoulders or waist while standing next to her in line for a movie or while chatting with her between classes.
After you place your arm around her shoulder or waist, you can gently caress her shoulder or hip with that hand.

, Your girl might enjoy your caresses even more if you give her some compliments while you are touching her.This can make the caressing seem even more intimate and special.


Try telling her she has the most beautiful eyes or softest hair you have ever seen. Find something you genuinely like about her, and the compliments will flow.
You can also just try telling her that she is beautiful, that her skin feels nice, that she smells great, or simply that you like her.

, It's always best to start by touching her in places that are not too sensitive and then move on to more sensitive areas if she is okay with it.For example, you can caress a girl on her arm, face, calf, or upper back to start.


If you have never caressed her before, try holding her hand to start. If she lets you hold her hand, and holds onto it for a while, then she might be interested in more touching and you can try touching her back or arm next.
If she likes what you are doing, you can start trying different places on her body. For example, you might move from her upper back to her lower back, or from her calf to her thigh. Watch for cues that she is open to this, such as smiling or moving towards your touch.
Avoid touching areas of her body that she might be sensitive about, such as her stomach.

, Girls love it when guys play with their hair and caress it. It's a romantic gesture that seems to have emotion behind it.


Tuck her hair behind her ear. If you notice her hair has come undone, or is in her way, brush it off her face. It probably won't stay there, but she'll definitely notice the gesture.
Girls enjoy having their long hair played with, stroked, and brushed. Run your fingers through her mane, eventually working your way up her neck to rub behind her ears.

, A girl's face and neck are intimate places to caress, but touching a girl in these places is a good place to start caressing. Try stroking her cheek and neck with one hand as talk to her and gaze into her eyes.


Gently brushing your fingers across her cheek is a really good way to let her know you want to kiss her, and give her time to react.

, You can also try caressing a girl's hands as a good starting place. This is a form of caressing that you can do in public as well.


Try rubbing your thumb across the back of her hand while you hold hands.
If you notice her hand sitting on a table next to you, try holding hands across the table, and then giving her palm a little massage.

, If you think that your relationship has progressed enough to try caressing her in more intimate areas, then you can try caressing those areas. Just watch her cues and listen to her. If she says she does not want to be caressed in a certain place, then back off and go back to something less intimate like holding hands.

Touching the outer thighs is a flirtatious move that you might try if you are in an intimate relationship. Try running your hands down the sides of her waist and down towards her thighs, and then bring them back up to rest near her hips.
Other areas of the body that are sensitive but often overlooked include the small of her back and her feet.However, be careful when caressing these areas because she might be ticklish.
If she's open to you caressing private areas, like her breasts, remember that these areas on a girl can be very sensitive. Start with the outside of her breasts and move inwards. Don't start at her nipples. As you caress more sensitive areas, make sure that you do not touch them too hard or too much., Only 10 to 15 percent of communication is verbal, so that means the rest is done through micro-expressions, such as body language and eye movements. Pay attention to her body language to determine if she might like you to caress her.

Does she make eye contact with you? Does she keep looking at you when she catches you looking? Is her body language open (facing toward you) or is it closed (arms crossed in front of her, for example).
Don't take it personally if she is just not in the mood for touching. Maybe she's tired or in a bad mood. Learn how to assess her moods through body language cues.If she plays with her hair, touches you first in anyway, moves closer to you, or looks at you and then looks away shyly, she is more likely to be open to your caress. These are all ways that girls flirt. If she likes it, she will let you know by snuggling up closer to you and maybe returning some physical affection. If she tenses up or becomes rigid, you should stop.

, There are some types of caressing that are appropriate for a public setting, while others are not. Your girl might feel uncomfortable if you try to touch her in certain ways around other people or in public. If you're in public, then you will want to vary your approach.


If you take a girl to the movies, hold her hand and rub circles on her palm. It's a small thing that will probably feel good to her.
What is appropriate is contextual. If you are walking down the street together, gently touching her elbow or the small of her back as you usher her across a street or through a doorway is great first contact. The next time, simply slide your hand gently up her back or along her arm before releasing your touch.
She will probably be more open to a caress in a private setting, such as your home or hers.

, Whether or not you should caress a girl depends on the type of relationship you have with the girl. Think about your relationship with her before you start caressing her.


Consider the duration of the relationship. If she tries to spend time with you, if you're exclusive or have been dating for some time, and if you have intimate conversations, it will be easier to caress her. The level of acceptable caressing is related to how intimate you are. As intimacy increases, so do opportunities for caressing.
If you are in the early stages of getting to know a girl, but have established some level of trust, a first gesture could be reaching out to touch her hand or her arm. Every girl is different in the physical category of relationships. You want to study her personality before you decide where or whether to touch her.

, There's no downside to being a gentleman. Girls like it, and then you won't risk picking up on the wrong cues. To caress a girl, you first need to be trusted and liked by this girl and receiving cues (verbal or via body language) that she wants to be caressed. If the girl does not know you, she probably doesn't want to be caressed by you. If she asks you to stop, then stop.


You can ask the girl if she likes what you are doing, ask her what she'd like you to do, or ask her to coach you and put your hands where she wants them.This can make her feel more comfortable by showing that you are open to her requests and boundaries.

, Some girls might automatically assume that caressing them means that you want to have sex. This can be an instant turn off to a woman who may not be in the mood or who may be wary that you only like her that way.


It helps to caress her a few times a day when you know that you do not want to have sex so that she doesn't feel as if you are only expecting to have your needs met. You want her to know that you are doing it for her, not for you.
Stroke her in the arm or run your fingers through her hair, and don't automatically head towards private areas! Maybe don't head toward them at all. For example, you could just gently stroke her wrist or arm while you are watching television together.

Take a break.",How to Bring Romance Back2," Think about the little things you do and have done for one another that come from a place of love.Those little gestures are romantic. Does your partner make the coffee for both of you in the morning? Does he text you during the day just to say hi or check in? All these little actions are ways of showing love and romance that often get overlooked as the years go on.


Take the time to compliment each other.The compliments you gave each other in the beginning on how you looked, your talents, or your actions, are likely no longer mentioned out loud. Bring complimenting your partner back into practice.

, Remember what attracted you to her in the first place by looking back on your relationship. Think about when you met your partner, what you thought then, and why you fell in love with her.

As you are recalling these things, share them with your partner.

Look over old pictures or love letters to each other.
Sit together over dinner or drinks and recollect together the beginning of your relationship.

Determine your love languages and values.,
Listen actively.,
Improve your connection.,
Be honest.,
Resolve conflicts.",How to Bring Romance Back3," Knowing your love languages and values is essential to beginning communication with each other about the romance in your relationship. Determining your love languages involves finding the way you and your partner show and prefer to receive love.In addition to learning your love languages, consider that, over time, your values may have changed.Determine where your values and your partner's values stand, as well as how in sync they are now.


Read Dr. Gary Chapman's book “The Five Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts” to learn about love languages and to help determine which ones you and your partner identify with.
The five languages of love are words of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch. The idea is that your spouse shows love in one of these ways and will feel most loved if you show him love in this same way.
Notice, for instance, if your partner is always complimenting you. If he is, this may mean his main love language is words of affirmation. This doesn't mean you can't express love in other ways — don't neglect physical touch or the other ""languages"" — but know that he will usually feel the most loved when you give him compliments instead of, say, the gift of a new golf club.
Your love language may be different from your partner's — that's okay. If your spouse shows love by giving compliments, but you need quality time to feel loved, then he should be willing to make an effort to spend more time with you.

, Conversation is a romantic activity that you can share with your partner every day. Take the time to sit down and talk about what happened during the day. Share your feelings about the events and check in with each other about how you are doing. When your partner shares her day with you, truly pay attention and participate in the conversation. Listen actively by trying the following:]

Remove all distractions that you can while having a conversation with your partner. Turn off the TV and put down your cell phone.
Every once in a while restate or summarize what your partner is telling you. This helps you make sure you are hearing her correctly and shows her that you are making an effort to pay attention.
Avoid using “Why” questions, quick reassurances such as “Don't worry about it,” or advising by stating “You should...”

, Intimacy and romance are about feeling connected to each other.If you feel that the romance has slipped away from your relationship, check to see how connected you feel to your partner. There may be some work you can do to feel more connected to each other. Try the following tips to be more connected to each other.Say “Thank you” to your partner for something each day.
Try to be more playful with each other.
Sneak hugs with each other.
Show more compassion for your partner.

, Having a real conversation with your partner about the romance in your relationship can help you reconnect. Talking it out and being honest allows you both to discover where the other person is coming from instead of guessing or assuming.Make sure you are getting a chance to say how you feel and your partner is also getting time to share as well.


Take turns telling each other what you need from the other person and the relationship.
Ask your partner what he is dissatisfied with and what he is satisfied with in your relationships as far as romance is concerned.
Talk about how you each are planning to change to have the future you want.
Instead of being critical about your partner, try to focus on what can be changed and what you can work on together.

, Opening up the lines of communication is the first step to addressing any issues that may be getting in the way of your romance.Over longer relationships, rough patches or even resentments are bound to happen. Take the time now to address and work on these issues.


Have a real conversation with your partner about what issues you are struggling with together. Together develop a plan to change the current circumstances that are causing the issues.
Seek professional help, if necessary. If you and your partner are having difficulty communicating or connecting, see a psychologist or a marriage counselor to help you get started."

Open yourself up to a deeper relationship.,
Imagine being with your partner long-term.,
Talk about your feelings.,
Express your love beyond physical intimacy.,
Be both physically and emotionally present with your partner.,
Say ""I love you"" when it feels right.,
Cultivate memories.,
Practice ""love"" every day.,
Be patient that a lasting love doesn’t happen overnight.,
Give your partner space.,
Make your time together special.",How to Bring Love Into a Relationship," Being willing to love, and be loved, can be an uneasy experience sometimes because you may be afraid of getting hurt, or making the wrong move. Take your mind away from the ""what if"" and focus on being caring, loving, and respectful of your partner in the present.


Make sure that you don’t feel pressured by your partner to commit to a relationship that you’re not sure about. Be honest about what your motivations are for being with that person.
Often times, being open to love is about being happy with yourself. If you are not happy with who you are, or what’s going on in your life, it will be hard to find and receive love. ;
, One way to know if you love someone is to imagine you’re in a long-term relationship with him. Do you see yourself with your partner in a year from now? Five years from now? Or even longer? If not, you may want to see if this relationship is simply based on physical desire, or a way to feel less lonely.


During the first few months of dating you may not be sure if you see yourself long-term with someone. It’s okay. Love often grows over time.
Be aware of how you feel as the months of dating progress. If you feel less interested in someone over time, don’t force yourself to say ""I love you"" or be in love with someone just because.

, It’s okay to say what you feel, just understand that your partner is not you, and may not respond exactly the way you do. Be vulnerable, and say how you feel about the person. It can be tough, but ultimately communication is key to a lasting relationship.Think about if you have meaningful conversations that show your true self to your partner. Love is about talking about who you really are, including your hopes, dreams, and worries. Be honest.
If you've been a relationship for a while, consider conversations that focus on positive feelings, rather than negative. Remind your partner what makes her special by talking about how you feel.

, Love is not all about attraction, kissing, and sex. Love is both a physical and emotional connection with your partner. Depending on your partner, there are many ways to show that you care deeply about someone.Ask your partner what makes him feel loved and cared for. What activities, actions, words, or gifts make him feel warm and fuzzy? The way you show love and the way your partner receives love may be different, so asking what makes him feel loved is the best way to know ensure you're expressing your love in a way he understands.


Give a compliment, or words of encouragement. Express with words what you like, and love, about your partner. Make him feel good about himself.
Give a gift, or make a symbolic gesture of love. Give flowers or chocolates. Make a favorite meal. Write a love letter. Play or send a song. Draw a picture that shows you care.
Give an act of service. You’d be surprised how the little things — like fixing something that’s broken, or completing an task your partner doesn't want to do — can make your partner feel cared for. Give your time and skills to your partner.

, It is crucial that your partner feels that you are interested, and listening, to her concerns, her passions and her dreams. You can’t just be physically present, but emotionally distant, or emotionally engaged but without any desire for your partner. Love means all of the above.


While you don’t need to be ""present"" all the time, it is important that you at least acknowledge your partner’s concerns, with words like, “I’m sorry you had a rough day.”
Try setting aside 10 – 30 minutes a day to talk about each other's days. It could be at dinner or after getting into bed. It sounds so simple, but checking in is an important part of maintaining a connection, and making a routine can make it a habit.
Don’t let yourself be distracted by other things when talking with your partner about something important. Be mindful of how and when to give your significant other your full attention.

, There is no perfect timing for when to say ""I love you."" If it's early in a relationship, think about whether saying ""I love you"" is more about your heightened desire for that person, or is it because you really know him? Each person is different, and may have a different level of comfort about how and when to say these words.If you're not yet ready to say, ""I love you,"" try ""I love it when you..."" or, ""I love your..."" instead.
If you’ve been dating for a year or more already, saying “I love you” may just feel like a force of habit. Make sure that saying “I love you” has meaning and passion behind it.

, If you're trying to reconnect with your partner, consider doing things that you both enjoyed when you were first dating. Talk about the good times that you've shared. This may help to show the strength and importance of the relationship over time.Use history as a way to connect (or reconnect), by remembering important milestones in the relationship.
By honoring those milestones, you are showing your partner that you think of her outside of the normal routine.

, There are lots of things that can prevent us making love a priority. Make a conscious effort to make the actions and emotions of ""love"" a part of your daily routine:.

Hold hands. Give a hug. Snuggle up to each other on the couch. This isn't just about sex, but the importance of being close in the simplest of ways.
Be positive in the ways you interact. Make sure that you give more than one compliment throughout the day (or however often you see your partner). It can be even as simple as saying, ""Thank you for all you do,"" or, ""You're amazing for doing that.""

, While you may have felt an instant connection with someone, it is open communication and commitment that will keep that love alive. Don’t force yourself to love someone, or say that you are ""in love"" with someone when you are still getting to know who he is and what he cares about.


Love at first sight may happen, but it’s the journey after that initial spark that is far more telling of whether your love will last.Give love a chance to grow. Sometimes we may not be instantly ""in love"" with someone. Give yourself and your partner a chance to really get to know each other, rather than what you see at first.

, Don’t crowd yourself into your partner’s life, and make her (or you) the center of the universe. It is far sexier to both men and women when you (and your partner) are confident and independent. Some people need more space than others. Be respectful of your partner’s wishes for space at times. Be confident that just because she needs space doesn’t mean she doesn't care.
Time alone or away from your partner can help give perspective, and can sometimes help to strengthen your relationship.

, Time is precious. Make sure to schedule or prioritize time with your partner. This is does not mean you need to schedule activities with your partner every day, all day. Instead, it means that you should focus on ""quality"" rather than ""quantity.""Quality time should be times when you can really talk with someone, or do something out of the ordinary routine. It can mean that your partner knows that he is an important part of your life, and that you value and respect him as a confidant, lover, and friend.
Trusting your partner with personal and private information, and knowing that the information is safe, is key to opening yourself to love. Love is often about having trust in yourself and your significant other.

Be firm.,
Let the person down easy.,
Shake your head ""no.""",How to Refuse a Kiss1," You don't need to kiss anyone that you don't want to kiss. Don't be afraid to just say ""no!"" Be kind and respectful, but make sure not to let anyone take advantage of you. Advocate for yourself. Only kiss people that you truly want to kiss., You don't need to violently reject a person who just wants to kiss you. Try to put yourself in his/her shoes. Imagine the amount of courage that it takes to ask a person for a kiss! Look for a way to respectfully and tactfully decline.


Try saying, ""I'm sorry, but I'm not romantically interested in you.""
Say, ""I love our friendship, but I'm not ready to take it to the next level.""
Say, ""Thank you, but no thank you,"" or ""I'm flattered, but I'm not interested.""

, If you are out with your boyfriend or girlfriend and he/she makes a move to kiss you, don't pull away and scare them. Just shake your head. If you pull away, they may feel rejected.

Make an excuse.",How to Refuse a Kiss2," Try not to flirt in a suggestive way. If you don't want someone to try to kiss you, then be very careful about how you interact with them. In general, a person will be more likely to try to kiss you if he/she thinks that you want to be kissed.


Perhaps you like this person, but you aren't ready for a kiss. You will need to be clear about your expectations. If the person goes for a kiss, let him/her down gently and explain exactly why you don't want the kiss.

, A person is much more likely to try to kiss you if you are alone together and having an intimate moment. Invite mutual friends to hang out with you, or make sure that a friend is with you at all times. Spend time with the kisser in public places where he/she will be unlikely to try for a smooch., Talk about something unrelated to kissing – something that will make it very hard for him/her to segue back to the subject of kisses. Suggest an activity that doesn't have much chance of leading to a kiss.


If you are refusing a kiss from a partner, hold his/her hand or rest your head on his/her shoulder. Show your partner that you can enjoy physical contact without kissing.
Constantly suck a lollipop when you're with them. It will be in your mouth, so they can't kiss you.

, If someone goes in for a kiss, divert them from your lips by tilting your head slightly to the side. Make it clear that you are offering up your cheek instead of your lips. The kisser should get the hint.

, Say that you have a cold or that you're recovering from a virus. Tell the person that you have a cold sore on your mouth, and that you don't want to kiss anyone in case you transmit the herpes simplex virus. Claim that you have a severe case of halitosis.


The problem with this approach is that it is just a delaying tactic. If you don't want to kiss this person at all, or not for a long time coming, then you'll need to say so.

It can be that the only way to end these situations is to leave them.

Let your inner circle know how happy she makes you.,
Tell a good story instead of bragging out of the blue.,
Don’t forget to let her hear you brag about her.,
Try not to brag too much on social media.",How to Brag About Your Girlfriend1," Gushing about your girlfriend is a great way to show your family and close friends how happy you are. A little bragging can be especially helpful when you introduce your girlfriend to your inner circle or tell them about her for the first time.For example, try saying, “I can’t wait to introduce you to my new girlfriend. She’s smart, down to earth, and I can’t remember being this happy.”;
, Bragging just for the sake of it can seem boring or unnecessarily boastful. Try to sing your girlfriend’s praises by telling an interesting story that naturally relates to a conversation.For instance, if you and your friends are talking about basketball, you could slip in, “You know, Rachael was an all state forward in high school.”
Try recounting the time she came to your rescue when you were stuck in a crazy situation. If you met in a funny or unique way, tell your friends about it., It’s always nice to hear how proud your partner is of you. Bragging about your girlfriend in front of her can help remind her how special she is.When you and your girlfriend are out to dinner with friends or visiting your parents, try mentioning her recent professional accomplishment or how she’s become such a pro at her new hobby.

, Everyone has friends who fill up their social media feeds with mushy, boastful posts about their partner. Try to keep in mind that your significant other isn’t so significant to everyone on your social network.

Posting pictures of you and your girlfriend on a trip is one thing, but daily oversharing on social media can put too much emphasis on how other people perceive your relationship."

Focus on her qualities and accomplishments.,
Keep private details private.,
Avoid reducing her to gendered stereotypes.,
Ask your girlfriend how comfortable she is with your bragging.",How to Brag About Your Girlfriend2," It’s great to tell your girlfriend she’s beautiful or gush about how gorgeous she is. However, instead of bragging about her looks alone, try to focus on her personality, achievements, and other qualities that make her a wonderful person.Brag about her professional accomplishments, like a laudable project she managed.Talk about an impressive test score, how she made honor roll or dean’s list, or how great of a mentor she is to her younger siblings.

, Bragging about your love life isn’t the most respectful way to convey what a great human being your girlfriend is. Further, when you keep intimate details about your relationship between the two of you, those details become more special and profound.It’s one thing to confide in your best friend about your love life. However, if you brag to all of your friends about how great your girlfriend is at intimate stuff, she might feel like nothing more than a conquest., Bragging about how great your girlfriend is at things like cooking and cleaning could come across as old fashioned and stereotypical. Instead of reducing her to an outdated gender role, try drawing attention to more complex personality traits.

For example, you could say, “Sophie is a great cook. She likes to glance at recipes, then add her own unique twists. Her creativity, intelligence, and quick-thinking never cease to amaze me!”
Try saying something like, “Her apartment is always spotless, and she loves to keep things in order. Among her many great qualities, she’s so responsible and has such attention to detail. She really makes me a better person.”   

, When in doubt, talk to your girlfriend about whether or not she likes it when you gush about her. Set clear boundaries about what’s up for discussion, when bragging is appropriate, and how much you should share about your relationship.Ask her, “Does my bragging ever make you uncomfortable? I love telling everyone how amazing you are, but I’d never want to put you on the spot or make you feel embarrassed.”

"
"
Offer details and evidence to back up your bragging.,
Make a list of things you appreciate about her.,
Come up with cute sayings.",How to Brag About Your Girlfriend3," Adding some specific details can verify and add meaning to your boasting. Instead of simply stating that your girlfriend has a great quality, try to add context by explaining why.For example, instead of just saying, “Lindsay is really good at her job,” try adding details like, “Lindsay just had a performance review at work. Her supervisor went on and on about how much the company relies on her, and said that she’s a rising star in her industry.”

, Spend some time reflecting on why you’re proud of your girlfriend, what makes her special, and why you’re grateful for her. Try keeping a mental or written list of those attributes. Whenever she does something noteworthy, add it to your list.In addition to listing her personal qualities and achievements, you could note things like the connection you share, the trust you have in each other, and how you make each other better people., Every now and then, think of something lovey-dovey to express how head over heels you are. Cute catch phrases and mushiness in moderation can be sweet, but try not to go overboard when bragging to your friends about your relationship.Once in a while, you could say things like, “I never imagined someone could add so much meaning to my life,” or “She makes me wish my life had a pause button so I could make every moment I spend with her last forever.”

Be self-deprecating.,
Compliment women regularly.,
Improve your charm.",How to Become a Ladies' Man1," Research shows a humorous man is a desired man.

Some tests have shown making a woman laugh improves your odds by nearly three to one.If you make a lady laugh, you’re golden.


Try listening to some comedians, taking their material, and fitting it to your personal situation.;
, Making her laugh is a great way to win her over, but making her laugh at your expense shows great confidence. It might be best to let her get to know you before trying this type of humor. Once she knows you are confident, she will certainly know you are joking when you use self-deprecating jokes. The trick to being self-deprecating is to make her laugh without believing how you just put yourself down. You don’t mean it, and she doesn’t believe it.""I have the body of a football player — fantasy football.""
""I walk two miles a day. One to the donut shop, and one home.""

, Guys who have compliments readily available are ready for any situation. Finding the right time to unleash the perfect compliment can flip a switch in another’s mind from disinterested to piqued. Avoid cheesy pickup lines and go for something unique and specific to her that will attract her attention. Keep trying and you’ll eventually find the right type of compliment that wins women over.Use an uncommon word. Instead of beautiful, use “stunning.”
""The confidence you exude is really sexy.""
""You really know a lot about this subject. You must be very intelligent.""

, Being charming is not that difficult. In fact, some argue the average man can be a ladies' man and just as charming as any other. Truly being charming is about paying attention to a woman, and turning her on based upon that shared connection.


Being able to intelligently converse with a woman is a huge turn on. Learn her keys, what she likes to hear, and time your replies to let her know you're really inside her head.
Be genuinely interested in her. Ask her about her likes, dislikes, family, travel plans, dreams, etc.
Show your vulnerabilities. Many women are self-conscious, and it's comforting to see a man that has own flaws."
"
Enjoy the moment slowly, without worrying about next steps.,
Ease back out of the kiss, keeping yourself close to your partner's face.,
Look your partner in the eyes and smile.,
Try not to force in any lines, quotes, or jokes to break the awkwardness.,
Continue building your relationship after your first kiss.",How to Respond After a Kiss1," A good kiss is a moment out of time, so savor it. Don't feel like you must immediately move forward or have something to do next. Just enjoy the kiss! More often than not, the two of you will naturally find something to talk about, do, or just keep on kissing -- so let the moment just happen.


In general, the best advice is just to go slow. Don't rush into anything. Instead, just take a breath and slow down your thoughts.
The best advice for responding after a kiss is to follow your heart. It sounds cliche, but all kisses are different, and you will know what to do if you just trust yourself.;
, After the kiss, pull your head back slowly to give each of you some space. If you wrapped a hand around each other, you can lightly ease off, or hold each other close for a more intimate moment.

, As you peel back, a simple, small smile is a great way to show your emotions without having to think of anything suave to say. More likely than not, there will be some nervous, happy giggles and smiles either way, but don't worry if you have ""nothing to say."" This giddy, semi-awkward moment is the perfect way to show how much you enjoy each other without movie-perfect quotes. You could also:


Run your hands through their hair.
Pull them in for a hug.
Wrap your arms around them, or cup their face.
Nuzzle your noses against each other.
Keep your faces, like forehead and nose, touching.
Hold each other for a quiet moment alone., Post first kiss, no matter the circumstances, can often get a little awkward. And that is okay! Learn to embrace this moment, which is honestly less awkward and more exciting, without feeling like you need to say something. Most ""smooth"" lines that people come up with after kisses are laughably bad -- a smile and a simple ""I liked that,"" is often more than enough.


Don't overthink things! Just keep being yourself.
If you feel confident and have something to say, say it! Even if it is a little corny, more likely than not he/she will laugh.

, A first kiss is just one step in a relationship, so don't put so much significance on it that you forget to be yourself. While things may be a little different for a day or two, there is no reason why a single kiss needs to change how you treat each other.The more you treat a kiss as a small growth in a larger relationship, and not the single most important moment in your lives, then it is doubtful that this will be your last kiss.

Smile often.,
Show presence.,
Make a grand entrance.,
Do not fidget.,

Additionally, it has an impact on boosting testosterone levels.Try a few of the following techniques to convey the image that will draw the right attention:


Practice good posture. Aside from positive health benefits, looking taller and more confident shows a degree of control.Stand with your arms a little wider than normal, or with your hands on your hips.Keep your arms and legs uncrossed. Crossing your arms and legs gives off a timid vibe. Uncross, remain relatively still, and try not to revert back into bad habits of looking defensive., You want to be noticed. Being the center of attention, even if for a brief moment, is key to gaining the eyes of the women in the room. Take your time upon entering by pausing at the entrance where everyone can see you.Arrive on time. Being fashionably late is not really preferred. You don’t want to appear to be someone who is disorganized and not in control.
Make the entrance fit the situation. There is a fine line between getting everyone’s attention and being narcissistic.
Look like wherever you are is the place you’re most happy. If people believe you’re excited about the situation, your positive vibe will rub off., Moving around a lot gives off an uncertain or nervous appearance. It also distracts from your overall effort of being suave and attention-getting. Instead, the attention will be on the fidgety movement. Find your crutch and try to stop doing it.Avoid biting your nails.
Don’t pop your knuckles.
Try not to tap toes or wiggle feet.

, Some research has shown that simply dressing up leads to an increase in perceived attractiveness. Choose clothing that accentuates your features and lines, something that makes you look more muscular. Try a few of the following tips to step your clothing game up:


Utilize fewer upper layers if you have a muscular build, and multiple layers if you're on the slender side.
Take good care of your shoes, and match them to your choice of attire.
Add in nice accessories, like a watch, pocket square, or tie clip to draw extra attention."

Give kind gestures at unexpected times.,
Be a flirt.,
Hug and kiss at appropriate times.",How to Become a Ladies' Man3," Randomly displaying affection is a surprising way to show her you care. Whether it’s a flirtatious pinch, a kiss, a shoulder rub, or a late night phone call, she’ll appreciate that you’re always thinking about her.Make it a point to pull out her chair somewhere unexpected and goofy, like a fast food restaurant.
Ask her if she needs help with anything heavy, or any other way to show your strength.
Buy her a small chocolate or treat when she’s having a bad day.
A card with words of encouragement would be a perfect “thinking of you”-move on a day she has a big test.

, Be a sexual person and flirt whenever you can.To flirt appropriately you’ll need to be witty. Women enjoy a clever back-and-forth. Flirting is partially teasing and partially showing you’re attracted. Try a few approaches similar to the ones below:


Make it clear that you’re being purposefully goofy, ""If you had to choose between me and Brad Pitt, how quickly would you choose me?""

Break the touch barrier. A gentle squeeze of the arm, a swipe of the hair, do something subtle and surprising.

, If hugging makes you feel uncomfortable, try a side hug. If you feel more brazen, try a firm hug with a squeeze, or maybe a peck on the cheek. Watch for signals, like winking, biting of the lip, or if she stares at your lips. Pull her in close and slowly kiss her, but be sure you’ve got fresh breath and aren’t too aggressive.Make eye contact as you’re going in for the kiss.
Don’t make it too long. Make it long enough to be memorable, but not exceedingly long.
Make sure you only kiss her. Don’t use it as an opportunity to touch or grab unnecessarily.

Be a genuinely nice guy.,
Connect on multiple levels.,
Take it slow.,
Listen to her patiently.",How to Become a Ladies' Man4," People are attracted to someone who can make them feel great. It’s scientifically measurable based on the release of dopamine. If you’re able to be the guy who makes others feel appreciated, you’ll draw plenty of attention. Being a guy who is fun to hang around, who makes people feel good about themselves, someone who is everyone’s favorite, is how you single yourself out.At bars, tip well and get to know the servers and bartenders.
Learn personal details about doormen and take an active interest in their lives.
Adjust your response to the other person’s moods. If they’re happy, yuck it up. If they’re down, genuinely show interest in their pain.

, Show the ladies that you care about them without noting their appearance. It’s not just about being physical. Compliment something other than her looks. You also need to appeal to her emotional and spiritual sides. Get in her head with a multi-faceted approach:""Your kindness is something that really draws attention.""
""I can’t believe how great a photographer you are!""
""When I’m around you it makes me want to strive for greatness."", Don't come on too strong right away. Studies show that if you have the interest of another person, being a little aloof may not make them like you necessarily, but it does make them more likely to pursue you. If she perceives you as a challenge of sorts, she’ll likely want to win you over. Someone who hinges on her every wish is not a challenge.Take your time in conversation with her. Don’t feel like you need to jump at every text message.
Be slow to show emotion and think about how you really feel.Do for her as much as you want, but be sure not to be the guy who jumps at her wishes.
In order for this to work, you also have to show a certain amount of interest. Women want to gain your favor, not grow frustrated., Being a good listener is a sure-fire way to attract women.Face her and be attentive. Try to listen to what she’s saying without judging and while trying to empathize.Cease all other activities. Put up your phone and really pay attention.
Do not interrupt. Listen until the entire message is delivered.
Rephrase what she just said to show you heard her.Ask follow up questions.
If you’re teaching her something, try to stay patient.

Overcome your fears.,
Embrace rejection as a learning opportunity.,
Change up your routine.",How to Become a Ladies' Man5," Bold people capable of tackling any challenge are sexy to women. A guy who can’t do anything and shrinks at the first sense of difficulty is not a man women desire. If meeting women has always been intimidating, overcome your fears and you’ll be a lot closer to being a ladies' man.


Work on improving your self-confidence in this way by owning the fear and resulting failure. Do not blame others for your lack of action.Imagine yourself meeting women, and when you’d normally fold, picture it going perfectly. They laugh at all your jokes, and provocatively reply to all your advances.
Concentrate on proper breathing. Take deep breaths. Breathe out a little longer than you breathe in, and you’re prone to calm down., All ladies' men have been turned down multiple times. Get stronger with each step backwards. Reevaluate your approach, your moves, your words. Instead of focusing on the failure itself, focus on what you can change for a better result the next time.Convince yourself the rejection is really what is best for your future. There are other people out there and you will meet someone who is better suited to you.
Acknowledge rejection as something you’ve defeated before. This is just the same hurdle.
Imagine how you could have been good for them. The ways you would have made them happy, laugh, and love you. They made a huge mistake missing out on you., When you find something that doesn’t work, like a specific outfit, a location, or maybe even the type of woman, try something new. Break out of your routine. What’s more, get pumped up about the change. Motivate and convince yourself the new avenues you’re going to take are going to be successful.Steer clear of women who look like your ex. This is not about proving something to yourself.
Go outside your comfort zone. You will meet a brand new set of women in places you’ve never been.

Keep your partner close to you, with your faces nearly touching.,
Move back in for another kiss if it feels right.,
Kiss other areas of your partner's face and neck.,
Take a second to ask if it is okay to move on before doing so.,
Try not to take yourself so seriously.",How to Respond After a Kiss2," A deep, passionate kiss is often the precursor to further passion, but all of the energy will dissipate if you move apart. Keep your bodies touching, reaching an arm around his back or bringing your hand up to cup her face. Staying tightly together keeps the charge alive and makes it easy to keep kissing.

, Maybe he's staying close, keeping up eye contact. Maybe you see her look back down at your lips quickly. Maybe you're both smiling, and it just feels right. By moving slowly after a kiss, keeping yourself close and not rushing into anything else, you get the chance let the situation unfold naturally, often into another kiss.At this point, you should stop reading this article! Let yourself ease into the moment, trusting both yourself and your partner.

, If things are feeling hot and heavy, move down to his neck or ears. Pull him close, directing his head lightly with your fingers if there are areas you want to be kissed. Let your own lips and hands dictate the sort of experience you want -- going lower if you want to increase the heat, or staying up if you're moving slowly and getting to know each other.You have an equal say in what happens after these deep, passionate kisses, so feel free to state your boundaries or slow things down.

, If you want to try things other than kissing, then it is always worth it to take a second and ask if he/she is comfortable. It seems weird, but it will not ruin the mood -- it simply shows respect for your partner.



A kiss is not an invitation to further activities. A kiss is just a kiss -- don't assume it gives you some sort of permission to move forward., In the movies, moments of passionate kissing are often heavy, dramatic, and mostly silent. But real life passion is much more diverse, exciting, funny, and a little goofy. Nothing goes perfectly. But that is half the fun -- knowing that you can laugh if she steps on your toes, or if he needs to turn away to sneeze. Instead of trying to control everything to be ""perfect,"" ""passionate,"" or ""sexy,"" just enjoy each other's company. Let the mood unfold as it may and just have fun."
"
Step back out of the kiss with a firm, confident motion.,
Kindly let them know that you don't think it is a good idea to kiss.,
Remove yourself from the situation.,
Find time later to explain why you didn't want to kiss, if it feels appropriate.",How to Respond After a Kiss3," If the kiss doesn't feel right for some reason, you don't have to freak out or jump back. When the kiss is over, take one big step back, clearly showing that kissing is over. It can also help to put your hands non-confrontationally in front of you, palms down, to send a message that creates space.

, Passions are going to be high right now, so keep this short and sweet. A simple ""I don't think this is a good idea right now,"" is often the best answer, as it keeps you from being mean or starting an argument. Simply state that you don't want to kiss.


In circumstances where one or both of you are passionate and emotional, it is usually best to avoid giving reasons or starting arguments. Keep things simple for now, knowing you can explain later.

, There is no reason to linger around now. You can explain your reasoning later, if need be. For now, just say that ""you're sorry"" and move on, separating yourself. It will make it easier for everyone to move on if you're not in the same room., If you have a friend who got a little drunk, and ex who had other ideas, or a platonic buddy who wanted something more, then you may feel comfortable explaining why you don't want to get romantic. Know, however, that you don't owe anyone an explanation if you don't want to give one -- simply not wanting to kiss someone is more than enough of a reason not to kiss them."

Have the wings of a social butterfly.,

Help your clients do it right.",How to Become a Matchmaker," In order to be a matchmaker, to be any good at it, and to make money, you've gotta have friends up the wazoo. Friends upon friends upon friends, acquaintances, coworkers, family members, online connections, mentors, accomplices – your life is just brimming with people trying to get to know you better. And you've got to know them well enough that you can engage with them about their personal lives.


Soon enough everyone you talk to will be a job prospect, or at least good experience. You need to be the type of person that enjoys talking to people about themselves and wants to see others succeed. Sound easy? Cool.;
, If you have a couple of ""set-ups"" under your belt before you get your business going, you'll have a better idea of personal compatibility and how to broach the topic of dating with others. You'll also have something to talk about when your first real clients want to take you seriously.


Right now, you're still low key. Just work on casually introducing friends to friends that you think might make a good couple. Hang out in groups and keep it pressure-free. You don't need to send them off on a romantic getaway quite yet.

, Playing matchmaker isn't just about making matches; it's also about listening to your clients wants and needs – and often issues. You'll have to hear about the last crazy ex, the commitment phobia they might be growing into, the fact that there are ""no good men"" or ""no good women"" out there, etc. Part of your job will be to convince them that they're worthy of love, they'll find it, and they'll be able to hold onto it. In a way, you give them hope.


This can actually help your matchmaking abilities, too. If you name Paul rushes into serious relationships, you won't think to pair him with Steven who is a 100% commitment phobic who likes to play the field. Who the people are on paper matters only as much as who the people are in their own minds.

, You'll need a way to manage every client you have, from their name and phone number down to what food they enjoy most. You can start a database, get a third party to manage this data for you, or come up with your own way to stay organized. Whatever it is, you need a way to keep every person's file readily accessible at the drop of a hat.


This won't be such an issue when you only have a few clients to handle. But when they start coming in droves, you'll need a way to make sure your job doesn't literally drive you crazy. It's good to have multiple copies of everything, too, just in case something goes wrong.

, Matchmaking is a growing field, and many professionals are taking advantage of their expertise and turning to teaching the ropes.Look into getting your license through a respected program so when you drop your business card, it's clear you know what you're doing.


Make sure it's a reputable program, though. There are plenty of courses out there that are complete bunk and are just looking to take your money. Do your research before you pay anyone anything.
This isn't mandatory, but it is recommended. A good course will also delve into the business aspect of it, helping you stay profitable in addition to getting clients and making successful matches., If you're not looking to be your own employer and go through the red tape of getting your own business started, you may be able to work for a larger team of matchmakers. Some people who went the business route find themselves so busy that they need to hire fellow matchmakers just to help out with their clients. It could be you get handed a wad of people who need your assistance.


The upside is that you get handed everything you need. The downside is that you have less autonomy and can't make your own rates. That being said, you could always start out working for someone else and if you like it, turn it into your own business prospect.

, So you decided to be your own small business, huh? Great. Now you need a business plan. This is essentially the homework it takes to get your business off on the right foot. Here's a few things a good business plan includes:


Data on your projected market – who it is, how big it is, etc.
Identifying your company's needs, at least initially
Coming up with marketing ideas to promote your ""product""
Determining initial costs
Research potential work spaces
Identifying potential investors

, While you may be your entire business and you could simply go off of your name, it may be easier to develop a specific name for your matchmaking business, or at least a title for yourself. ""Norma Jean: Professional Matchmaker,"" is fine, but ""A Match Made in Heaven"" may look better outside that brick building you're looking to rent. Ultimately, it's just something that has to match your vision.


If you're planning on keeping it at just you and your website, you may be able to get away with not having a name or slogan. ""Norma Jean – Professional Matchmaking Since 2014"" will do just fine (though you may want to avoid rhyming). For now, don't fret about it. Concentrate on what you have to offer and the answer may come to you.

, Starting a small business isn't just about renting an office and getting someone else to pay your bills. There's lots of paperwork and red tape you have to get through to make sure it's all kept legal.With a good business plan as discussed above, this shouldn't be a problem.


You may want to consider hiring an accountant and/or a legal advisor to help you get going in this process. The money needs to be tracked down the penny, especially in the early stages (mainly for tax purposes and to determine qualifying terms).

, In today's day and age, you may be able to get away with just having a website – especially if you want to work nationwide (or even worldwide eventually). You'll then be able to focus on dealing with clients online, which is one of the easiest ways there is. You set your own schedule, and that's that. You're like a personalized version of eHarmony or Match.com.


The benefit of having a brick and mortar establishment to your name is that you can work on the individual level with clients in the area. Meeting face to face will definitely give you a better read on them and likely lead to you producing better matches. It's also helpful for those that don't want to work through a computer.

, When you're just starting out, you're going to want to keep your prices very reasonable. You may even want to start out working for next to nothing – especially if the relationship doesn't last. But as you get your feet wet, start thinking about your rates. Are you charging per hour? Will certain, more difficult clients be charged more? What about your target audience – how much are they willing to spend on something like this?


You won't want to charge on the basis of a relationship. Instead, try to focus your rates more widely. For example, for $1,000, they can have access for an entire year to your entire pool of clients that are looking for people like them. You'll work with them as much as they need to find that perfect person. It'll all depend on what kind of services you offer and what kind of people you're dealing with.

, To build your client base, you'll need to get the word out there, and word of mouth likely won't be enough. You'll need to buy ad space on Google, optimize your SEO, start offering discounts, buy airtime, work on partnerships, etc. When you're not chatting away with a potential client, this will be your full-time job. For a while, it'll be the brunt of it, too.


A lot of it will be networking. Get your business a Twitter and Facebook, make events, attend events, and be the face of your company. Friend people, give them your card, sign up with a local bar, crash a speed dating event, and go to where your clients are. They may not be able to find you by themselves. After all, they're too busy looking for love.

, As a matchmaker, you have two types of clients: those willing to get matched and those looking for matches. Those looking for matches are the only ones you're charging and the only ones who you work for. The ones willing to get matched are just in the pool waiting to be potentially chosen. But either way, you need to get a good understanding of both to make sure your matches make sense and can last the test of time.


In the interview process, you'll need to get personal. Everything from their sexual history to how they sleep at night to their physical preferences to their relationship with their mother. You need to see the person like their significant other would see them. Talk about all the taboos and get their dirty laundry aired out. You need to see their bad side, too.
Ask them to be real with you. You need to know exactly what they're looking for. If they want a human Barbie doll or a millionaire athlete, they need to say that. What is their idea of the perfect match and who would they never, ever give a chance?

, Make sure every client signs a contract with you, establishing just how this process is going to work. In many cases, they may or may not find true love, and you don't want to get sued over this. You're simply offering the potential for love, more often than not. Whether it works out or not is often up to them. To avoid any unfortunate legal issues, have a contract drafted covering all the necessary details.


Along with this, each client should be filling out informative paperwork on their own person as well. Have, in writing, all their information. Start with the basics – their name, phone number, employer, etc. – and end with personal questionnaires getting at the aspects of their personality. By the end, each client should have a folder you can reference later when need be.

, Your moneymaker is your ability to meet people, point blank. What's more, your number of clients dwindles with every success you have, making it more imperative you keep the water flowing, if you will. To find your target audience, you'll need to network at the right places. Be active in your community. Go bar hopping, hit up festivals, attend parties you don't really care to go to, and always be on the lookout for potential clientele.


Singles' events are veritable gold mines for a person in your business. It's best if you're single yourself, but you could probably work your way around that with enough charm and poise. It'll be very clear you're in there to make a buck, so put on your best outfit and keep the genuine smiles ready when you go in for the kill.

, Once you set up Stacey and Zach, your work isn't over. You'll need to check in with both of them routinely (especially in the beginning) to assess how it's going and if there's anything you can do to help. In this way, you're sort of like the mediator. After all, you want it to work out. It's a credit to your name!


In addition to supplying the services you said you'd supply, you're also keeping in the loop as to how you're doing. If they fall madly in love, that's a success you can put under your belt and something you can talk about in the future. When you're pitching yourself to your next potential client, Stacey and Zach are a good way to show you have the chops and are worth the investment.

, Let's set the record straight: most people, if not everyone, are looking for someone they're attracted to. If you want them to set up a second date, this has to be there. And it's not always physical. It can be totally intangible, like a person who just seems to have a ""magnetic personality.""So when you go to match two people up, think to yourself, ""Will they be attracted to each other?""


Because of this, you need to know what gets your client(s) going. Start with the physical stuff first, since that's the easiest. Once you find someone who you think meets their physical requirements, you can move onto the personality and values of their potential mate.

, It's easy to look at Darrell and Andrea and think to yourself, ""They both love a good wine – they should totally date."" In reality, that's not how it works. It's great when people have things in common, but it's so much more than that. It turns out that Darrell is a huge introvert that hates crowds and Andrea is a night owl that parties all the time. There's no way those two would work. Know what the people are really like, not just aspects of something they like or do.


Often this will mean getting real with your clients. Have they ever been abused? Do they end up dumping their significant others when things start getting tough? Do they have trust issues? Any mental illnesses or hints thereof? Are they aggressive or overly temperamental? Are they a doormat? These are all things that matter to their happiness in a mate and to your success as a matchmaker.

, In other words, get rid of the clients you don't get along with and that aren't looking for actual relationships. If someone has a violent history, don't take them on. If someone is only looking for a string of one-night stands, don't take them on. You're a business and you have the right to refuse service to anyone. After all, you're putting someone else's life in their trajectory. You don't want to end up instigating undue harm to any party.


That's the extreme of it. The other side is those clients that just aren't actually ready for a relationship. We all know those people that say they want a relationship (and a successful one at that), but in reality they just need to love themselves first.If someone comes to you who is just too insecure to have a stable, adult relationship, let them know the truth. Maybe they don't even know.

, Every one of your clients is looking for a relationship, yes, but the word ""relationship"" means different things to different people. What does it mean to the person you're working with? Does it mean a movie on Friday nights and the occasional coffee between 80-hour work weeks or does it mean texting every 4 hours between furtive glances in the sheets?


More often than not people are different in a relationship than they are just as themselves. They become stronger or weaker, have different expectations, different priorities, and focus on different things. This is the person you need to get to know beneath who they are on the outside. It's not just who they are, it's who they are as a boyfriend or girlfriend.

, Not only are you matchmaking your clients, but you're also operating as a mentor, therapist, and relationship guide. This is not the type of transaction where you get the check and that's that – you have an investment in these people. So when they're struggling or not sure what to do, help them out in whatever way you can. You want a happy customer, right?


Let's say Cliff has been on a couple dates with several of your clients and nothing has worked out. In that situation, you may want to take Cliff aside and have him talk through the dates so you can pinpoint ""where he's going wrong."" It could be that he just has high expectations and isn't letting the relationships progress, or he's doing something silly like obsessing over an ex. You want your clients to be successful, but sometimes they need a prod in the right direction.

Whether you're standing up or sitting down, make sure you're always in a comfortable position.,
Relax around him.,
Never seem uncomfortable towards your boyfriend kissing you in front of everyone.,
You might turn a little red after this all happens but if you do, so what!,
You should keep the kiss short, as no one wants to witness a full on make-out session.

",How to React when Your Boyfriend Kisses You in Front of Your Friends,";
, If you are sitting down and you are in front of all your friends or family and your boy kisses you in front of everybody, just relax. When the kiss is over, just go on with what you were doing.

, If this is what you do sometimes, he might start to think that you are ashamed of being his girlfriend.

Tell him how good he looks.,
Praise his accomplishments.,
Ask for his advice.,
Compliment his ability in bed.,
Brag on him to others.",How to Boost a Man's Ego1," Every guy likes hearing that he looks good—even when you’ve been in a relationship for a long time. Even if he’s not confident about his looks, sincerely let him that you are attracted to him. Give him a specific compliment every few days, like how great he looks in a certain shirt.If he goes to the gym, say “Your workouts have been really been paying off lately. You look irresistible.”
It wouldn’t hurt to tell him that other people would drool over his good looks. That doesn’t mean he would want those people. It would just make him feel good that someone thinks he’s attractive that isn’t intimately involved with him.;
, Make a big deal out of it when he accomplishes something. It could be a promotion, a finished art project, or something as simple as finishing a household task that took a while for him to complete. Let him know how proud of him you are. You could make him his favorite dinner, give him a gift, or throw him a surprise party. It will make him feel special.If he has recently been promoted, say “I knew you would get that promotion. I am so proud of you. How do you want to celebrate?”

, Think of something you’ve been struggling with for a while. Perhaps you have had a fight with a friend and aren’t sure how to solve it. Or, it could be something bigger. For instance, maybe you were offered a job but aren’t sure you should take it. Ask him for his advice. Then, compliment his ability to give you helpful and thoughtful advice.You could ask for advice when it comes to something small, like choosing an outfit. Ask him which dress or outfit he thinks you should wear.
You don’t have to take his advice, but asking for it will make him feel valued.

, Men are often very physical creatures. A physical relationship isn’t everything, but it would boost his ego to know that he is pleasing you. You can tell him that you he’s the best you’ve had or could have. Or, tell him specific things you like that he does.For example, you could tell him that you love how thoughtful he is when it comes to your needs.

, Ideally, you should do this in front of other people while he’s around. You could say something about how he recently got a promotion, or how great he has been with the kids. Knowing that you are proud enough of him to brag will be an instant ego boost.You could say “He always has been a great partner, but he has been especially great lately. I feel so luck to have him!”
Even if you brag while he’s not around, it might get back to him. It will make him feel great if a friend tells him that you complimented him when he wasn’t there.

"
Laugh at his jokes.,
Look at him from across a crowded room.,
Show him that you find him attractive.,
Send him a text during the day.,
Initiate intimacy.",How to Boost a Man's Ego2," Making a man feel like he has a great sense of humor is sure to boost his ego. You might have different senses of humor, but don’t resist laughing when he does or says something genuinely funny. Don’t force fake laughter because that may make him feel like you pity him. Also, don’t laugh at him when he falls or does something unintentionally funny.


Say something like “you’re hilarious” when he cracks a joke.

, Make your man feel like you can’t take your eyes off of him. This works especially well when you’re in a room full of people that could easily get you attention. Don’t stare at him the whole time. This might make him feel like you’re tracking his movements. Instead, smile at him or wink at him a couple of times when you’re separated., Outside of complimenting his appearance, show him what qualities he has that you find attractive. Let him know when he’s doing something that turns you on. Tell him that he’s looking too good to resist. Don’t be afraid to show your desire for him.Before he leaves for the day, say “Wow! You’re looking extra handsome today! But I also said that yesterday because you always look great.”

, It will make him feel good to know that you can’t stop thinking of him when you’re apart. Don’t bombard him with texts all day because that could get annoying. One or two texts will be enough. You can say something as simple as “thinking of you.” Or, you could tell him how much you want him.Send him a text that says “Can’t wait until I see you tonight.” Suggest that you’re going to help him relieve the stress of a long day.
You could send a text telling him that you can’t stop thinking about the amazing time you had together last night.

, Physically show your man that you can’t resist him by being the one that initiates intimacy. It doesn’t necessarily have to be sexual. You could give him extra kisses, hugs, and cuddles. But, it’s also a good idea to seduce him if you feel comfortable with it.You could take this up a notch by wearing lingerie or indulging in one of his fantasies.

"
"
Tell him when he has done something right.,
Let him know you’re thankful for his dedication to you.,
Do something he likes.,
Embrace his flaws.,
Let the small things go.,
Ask him for help.",How to Boost a Man's Ego3," Don’t let the little things go unnoticed. You don’t have to compliment every little thing, but some praise for the everyday good he does will make him feel great. You could let him know how much you appreciate him changing diapers, doing taxes, or making dinner.You could say something along the lines of “You’ve been so helpful around the house today. I appreciate it so much.”
You don’t even have to tell him you appreciate these things. You could replace words with a high five or fist bump sometimes.

, Being loyal in a partnership is expected, but it doesn’t hurt to let your man you appreciate his dedication to you. In a world where betrayal seems common, tell him that he makes you feel lucky. If you have a family together, tell him you appreciate his dedication to your children. Let him know that his dedication makes a big different in your family’s life.For example, you could say “I see how much hard work you put in for this family. That hard work does not go unnoticed by anyone.”

, Outside of telling him that you appreciate his interests and talents, try to do something with him. It will be a confidence boost for him to know that you want to learn more about what he spends time doing. If he likes to play baseball, ask him to teach you the basics. If he enjoys a certain video game, learn how to play it and then surprise him by playing it with him.It could also be something as simple as cooking him Italian food for dinner, even if it isn’t your favorite.

, He may be having a hard time accepting his flaws, which brings his ego down. Pointing out flaws happens sometimes, but try to refrain from it. Instead, tell him you appreciate his flaws, and teach him how to appreciate them as well. Perhaps he can be a little too envious of people sometimes. Sure it’s annoying, but by embracing it, you can work together to fix the problem.If he’s a little insecure, you could say “I know you feel a little less than confident sometimes, but understand that you don’t need to feel that way. I think your great. Either way, we can work together to help you overcome that feeling.”
Some flaws shouldn’t be embraced. For example, maybe he’s wildly jealous to the point where you lose friends. This is a flaw that should be pointed out and changed as soon as possible.

, Yeah, it’s difficult to let small problems go sometimes. Maybe he keeps leaving his wet towel on the bathroom floor. Or, he dropped the eggs even after you told him to be extra careful with that bag. Things happen. Sure, there are some things that shouldn’t be let go, but try to let the small things go. It will make him feel more confident if every mistake he made isn’t called out.If certain problems persist, like not cleaning up after himself, it’s okay to gently bring up the problem. Try to avoid nagging.

, You are, of course, a capable and independent person, but it often makes a man feel good to know that you need him. It’s not necessary to ask him to ask for help for every little thing, or it could get annoying for him. Instead, occasionally ask for him to help with a problem you’re absolutely sure he would know how to solve.For example, if his job is fixing computers, ask him to help with your slow computer.
If he’s great at fixing things, ask him to fix a wobbly table.

, You both have friends. Why not enjoy their company as well? Plus, having other people around brings more variety to the table. The things that go on when you have more friends around will give you and your significant other more to talk and laugh about.

, The most fun happens when you're willing to get out of your comfort zone. It'll be fun and you may get to show your girl how brave you are!

, That gets dull fast. Make it fun.

, Making plans can be wonderful. Then you know what will be going on and such. However, randomly having a perfect idea for something doesn't happen every day. But when those ideas come along, it isn't bad to try them out. Don't be scared to toss out your plans to try out a brilliant idea that one of you has. On the other hand, be careful not to rely too much on your marvelous ideas.

Get to know the girl better.,
Sit next to her if she's in your school or workplace.,
Swap numbers or email addresses.,
Ask her out for a date.,
Take her out.,
Show gestures and positive body language during.,
Take her home.,
Persevere.",How to Let Her Know You Love Her," Don't jump ahead of yourself. Start off with some casual conversation, shoot her a compliment every once in a while. If she blushes, smiles, or reacts in a positive way you're on the right track.;
, If you can get a little closer, do so that she can adjust to your wavelength and she might even know what you're trying to say without you saying anything.


Of course, be mindful of her personal space.
Don't be creepy. Inappropriate closeness, touching, or jokes that seem like no big deal, can be considered harassment if she is uncomfortable.

, She is the one who will say ""Hi"" every time you log on, never ever start the conversation off, the same with texting, she will be the one who texts 50000 times a day, and you WILL respond to every single one of them, that way she knows you're listening. You don't have to act interested, but don't let her know this, crack a few jokes over the phone when you get to that stage and if you can, keep her on the line as long as possible, it might give you an expensive phone bill but a woman usually admires anyone who will take the time to listen to her.

, When you've gotten closer ask her out. Always do so in person. Never over the phone, text, or internet., Make sure the venue is nice. While it doesn't have to be ultra high class you may have to drop some money on this.

, You will know she is really liking you if she looks at you, looks away and flutters her eyelids at the floor. If she tries touching your hand and gives silly excuses you know are lies, that's good too, she wants to get physical with you, but don't overdo it. Look at her face, not at her chest, this shows you respect her and she'll like this. If she stares into your eyes and smiles, take this as a definite sign she enjoyed tonight, but don't assume she loves you, that will come later.

, Walk her or drive her, when you get there, walk her to her door, this will definitely let her know you're loyal and really really like her, it would be better to walk her home rather than drive her there, if she tries to hold your hand, let her and hold her like she's a piece of delicate glass. If she starts blushing or sweating, this is a very very good sign, if she says ""I had a wonderful night"" this is good, if she pecks you on the cheek, even better, but let her kiss you then leave her to go in her house, never ever try to go for the lips, unless she goes for yours first.

, Send friendly gestures. Chocolates, teddy bears, and flowers are all classics but they work. This will tell her what you wanted to say, you really love her, she knows you love her but you need to get her side of the story as well.

Commit.,
Communicate effectively.",How to Love a Person for Who They Are," Seek to understand the other person better. Maybe you’re having difficulty with their beliefs or actions, which are different from your own. Maybe some things they do remind you of aspects of yourself you don’t like.


Talk to them about their opinions and beliefs. You don’t have to agree with them, but by talking you can try to understand or tolerate where they’re coming from.
Be open and curious. Come to them with a genuine interest in learning what they think.
Understand that it’s normal and human to wish for others to be different or to change.;
, Empathy is the ability to take on someone else’s perspective and feelings, so as to understand them better and act differently toward them. You can grow your ability to empathize with others byRemain curious. Talk with other people you don’t know very well to learn more about perspectives and worldviews different from yours.
Challenge your own prejudices.
Search for what you have in common with others instead of what divides you.

, Accept your differences and similarities. Appreciate the other person’s uniqueness and your own.You can indirectly practice acceptance by saying to yourself a mantra: “I accept you. You are who you are. We are all unique and your path is different than mine.”The more you say it, the kinder you will feel toward them.
You directly practice acceptance to the other person by listening and validating their feelings.. For example, if a friend just got fired from her job, you can say, ""It sounds like you're really feeling scared about what to do next, which is understandable since you had a hard time the last time you lost your job."" Don’t focus on any judgments you have about her losing the job, just focus on her.

, Share activities and seek connection with the other person. This will help bring you closer, learn more about who they are, and give you memories to share.Spending time together will also help your communication and help you build on each others’ strengths. Some activities to consider:Sharing a meal together.
Camping or spending time outdoors.
Working on a puzzle or another project together.
Walking.

, Think about what expectations you have of the other person. Write them out or talk them through with a trusted friend or counselor. Are your expectations achievable or realistic? Start looking at who they are and what they can do, not who you want them to be.For example, if you want your spouse to spend time with you after work, you have to directly ask them. It's unrealistic to expect them to read your mind and know what you want without you telling them. Instead, you can say, “I’d like for us to spend time taking a walk together after you get home from work. Would that be something you can do?”

, Vulnerability is the feeling you get when you let your guard down to be open with others about your feelings, mistakes, and imperfections. Being vulnerable requires courage and for you to put yourself out there.Without vulnerability, it’s hard to experience love, joy, and connection. You can encourage vulnerability by letting go of the need for yourself and others to be perfect.Maybe you had a bad day and you yell at your children out of frustration. Instead of moving on, try to be vulnerable. You can go back to your children later and say, “I’m sorry. I’ve had a really hard day and I took it out on you by yelling. I shouldn’t have done that.” This shows them that it’s okay to make mistakes, and that parents aren’t perfect either.Maybe you’re worried about what your mother-in-law is thinking of your house being dirty when she came over. Instead of worrying she’s judging you, try be vulnerable and show your feelings. You can say, “I’m sorry. We’ve just been going through such a tough transition to both of us working full-time, that I haven’t had time to clean up before you got here.”

, Even when you show empathy, understanding, and acceptance toward others, they may not do the same. You may be holding on to hope that they'll change. Remember that you can only change yourself and your reactions to those around you. Instead of constantly trying to stand up for yourself, try reframing your thoughts.Maybe your mother-in-law continues to criticize your cleaning skills every time she comes over, even though you've explained you are very busy right now. Instead of wishing she'd change, you can think to yourself, ""It's okay for me to have imperfect cleaning skills and not meet her expectations. I love her for her attention to detail, but I don't have to live like her.""

, Even if you have differing opinions, traits, and personalities, you can still learn to like and love someone if you set boundaries.


Be honest when they are frustrating you or when you disagree. You can say, “Am I upset that you don’t agree with me? Yes, but you’re entitled to your perspective, too, and that’s okay.”Limit the time you spend with them. Have an exit strategy if you need to leave.Know what topics you need to avoid with them.

, Show your appreciation to each other by complimenting and encouraging one another. Make an effort to highlight what you like about each other, instead of focusing on the negatives.Keep a gratitude journal. Every week, write down five things you are grateful for about the other person or your relationship. This will help to remind you of their good qualities instead of focusing on trying to change them., Invest time and interest in each other. Commit to each other during tough times and good times. Commit to continually working on accepting one another and working through any problems together.Forgive each others' differences.
Be present. Don't talk on your phone, do work, or focus on other things when you're trying to spend quality time with each other.
Establish traditions with each other.
Develop and share common goals, despite your differences.
Be willing to make sacrifices or compromises.

, Be specific, clear, and direct about what you want and need from each other. Share your perspective and listen to theirs. Show you understand by rephrasing their words and asking them questions.Use moments of disagreement as teaching moments about what you need. For example, if you’re struggling to love your grandchild because they never say “thank you,” you can say, “I love spending time with you and spoiling you with ice cream, but I feel sad when you don’t tell me “thank you.” Let’s both try to say “thank you” when people do nice things for us, ok?”"

In fact, if you really want to love a man, then you have to show it by letting him do his own thing once in a while. If he likes reading in his study or working on his carpentry skills in the garage, you don't have to hover around every two seconds asking what he's up to or if he needs anything. Sure, it's great to share interests with your loved one, but it's equally important to respect the fact that he'd like to do his own thing from time to time.


If you really want to love a man, then you have to be able to tell when he really wants to be left alone. Leaving him alone when he just wants some peace is a way to show him your real love.;
, If he's going out with the guys, then let him do his thing. Though he shouldn't go out boozing with his buddies without you every night in the week, every once in a while, a man needs to just unwind and hang out with a bunch of other men. There's nothing wrong with that, just like there's nothing wrong with the fact that you want time with your girlfriends. The next time he has ""guy time,"" don't be suspicious, call him a million times while he's out, or resent him for spending time with his friends. If you're cool with letting him hang out with his friends sometimes, then he'll appreciate you even more when he comes back to you.


Obviously, this doesn't mean he should go womanizing and binge drinking with his rowdy friends every chance he gets. If this is the case, then you will have to have a talk with him.

, If you're committed to always proving that you're right, then it won't get you very far in your relationship. Though sometimes it may be important to get your message across, it's not as important as being part of a positive, mutually-beneficial relationship. Okay, so maybe your man was wrong about something, and he already feels bad about it. Ask yourself if it's worth it to say, ""I told you so,"" and to make him look and feel like a bigger fool. If you really care for him, then you'll sympathize with him instead of making him feel worse.


Sure, there are times when you really feel like getting your point across and want him to get the message so he doesn't make the same mistake again. That's okay, too, as long as you know how to pick your battles.

, Sometimes a man may just need a little quiet time to himself. If he just got home from work, or you just got home and he seems like he's doing his own thing, you don't always have to start talking about everything and hanging out over a glass of wine. Though this is the way many women unwind, this is not the way that most men always like to relax, so you have to be understanding of the fact that he may just want a little quiet and some TV time to relax a bit.


Sure, it's important to spend time together, but you shouldn't make him feel guilty if he needs some alone time. Try not to take it personally.

, Yeah, many women like to sit and talk about all of their problems because they think that this is the best way to solve them. But not so with men. Though it's important to talk about the things that are bothering you, many men don't like to talk the second they are upset and need some time to think everything through on their own. If you know he's had a bad day or you're going through a rough patch, try giving it a little time instead of trying to talk it over the second that it happens.


It may be your thing to talk about something the second it's happened, but you have to respect the fact that he may not want to talk right away. On the other hand, that doesn't mean you should never talk about your feelings.

, An important part of loving a man is listening to what he has to say. You don't always have to be the one who is talking, telling him how much you love him, or starting a conversation about how his day went. If he's talking to you, then don't interrupt or wait for the time when you can say something. Hear him out, especially if he doesn't open up to you as often as you'd like. Once he's said his part, you'll have a sense of what he wants -- either some advice or just a sympathetic ear.


Listening is a skill that can be developed. Work on latching on to the details of what he says and mentioning them later -- he'll be impressed by how much you care.

, Though you don't have to make your man feel like a macho man or a superhero all the time, one of the worst things you can do is to make him feel like he's about two feet tall. Hold your tongue instead of calling him names or making him feel like a loser or a disappointment. You should especially hold off on saying anything demeaning to him in public or in front of your friends. If you're disappointed in how he acted, then you should have a productive discussion about it, instead of calling him names.


Think about it: you wouldn't like him to demean you either, would you?

, Sure, you and your man can both benefit each other and make each other better people in the long run. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be true to who each of you are and try to turn into completely different people. If you really love your man, then you have to accept him for who he is and stop trying to make him into someone else. You can certainly help him improve a few qualities, but on the whole, you should love him for who he is, not who you hope he will be.


If you're trying to change him, he'll catch on to it fast, and will feel hurt, and like he's not good enough for you.

, Remember that he's a man, not a mind reader. If you really want to love a man, then you have to give him something to work with. While you don't have to tell him about every little thing that made you upset, you should be able to tell him if something's on your mind. Women often get frustrated because men can't somehow divine what they're thinking at all times, and this can lead to nasty and pointless arguments. Spare him the hard work and tell him something if you feel strongly about it.


Okay, so if you're clearly upset and he's completely oblivious, then you can get a little angry, but don't expect him to know every little thing on your mind -- you don't know every little thing he's thinking, do you?

, This is another important aspect of showing a man that you love him. If you do, then you'll be able to suck up your pride and to tell him when you've made a mistake. Don't just hope that he forgets about it and still thinks you're perfect. No one is perfect when it comes to relationships, and it's best for you to tell him when you're wrong and to avoid doing it again, if you can. He'll appreciate your honestly, and will feel like you respect him more for it.


Nobody said it was easy to say you're sorry, but the more you get in the habit of doing it, the easier it'll be.

, If you really want to love a man, then you have to make him feel good about himself. You can certainly say, ""You're so hot"" or ""I love it when you…"" but you can also dig deeper and let him know what you really like about him, or just say something unique that makes him see that you care. Don't ever take your love for granted and assume that your man knows exactly how you feel about him. He should always know that you love and appreciate him for who he is. Here are some great compliments you can give him:


""You're so good at making me feel better when I've had a bad day.""
""It's amazing that you're so dedicated to running when you're so busy with work. I wish I could get motivated like that!""
""You know that you can make almost anyone on the planet laugh, don't you?""

, Let him know that you're grateful and thankful for your awesome relationship. Don't just assume that he knows you're grateful for it because you've stuck around so long. Take the time to let him know how much you love being with him, and for thanking him for whatever he does for you. (Of course, he should also show his gratitude towards you.) This will make him see that you really do love him and appreciate the time you spend together. Here are some things you can say:


""I just feel so lucky to have found someone as special as you. I can't imagine how hard it is for all of my single girlfriends to try to find someone half as amazing as you are…""
""I can't believe I found you. We're both so lucky to have each other, aren't we?""
""No matter how bad my day at work is, I'm always comforted by the fact that I have you in my life. At the end of the day, I'm just thankful to have someone like you by my side.""

, Sometimes, your man may need you to pump him up a bit. He may be upset about a professional setback or a conflict with his friends and family. You'll need to step in to be his cheerleader, and to make him feel good about himself, like he can accomplish whatever he wants to accomplish, or like the setback he had can easily be overcome. He may not ask you to make him feel better, but you'll have to be able to recognize when he really needs your support.


Say something like, ""I know you may be disappointed because of….anyone would be. But I know you can get through it.""
Or, if he's unsure about achieving a future goal, you can say something like, ""Don't ever doubt yourself. I know you'll be amazing at anything you put your mind to doing.""

, Some women think that men just really want women who can take care of them, and that's true, to an extent. However, you shouldn't spend all of your time taking care of him, cleaning up after him, cooking for him, or doing the kind of stuff his mother might have done for him, or he may stop seeing you in a romantic light. Sure, every man needs to be mothered a bit, especially when he's sick, but that doesn't mean that you should be his primary caretaker.


You want your relationship to be fun, supportive, and sexy. If you mother him too much, you'll forget that you're also his lover.

, Though sex shouldn't be a deal-breaker, yeah, sex is an important part of many relationships. You should make time for some fun in the bedroom -- when you're in the mood, of course. It's easy to put off sex because you're tired, have too much work to do, or just don't feel like putting in the effort. But making time for sex at least once or twice a week will make both of you feel more intimate with each other, and it will also make you feel happier! Don't just do it for him -- do it for yourself, too, and for the sake of your relationship.


A lot of couples who have been together for a while get into the same boring lovemaking routine. Try mixing it up and having sex at a new time or a new place, whenever you feel like it.

, One great way to love a man is to be happy and secure with who you are. This will make him appreciate you more and feel like your relationship is good for both of you, not like he has to spend all of his time building you up. Work on loving yourself, your body, what you do, and who you surround yourself with, and all of your relationships will benefit from this. Nobody's perfect, and it's important to be aware of your flaws so you can address them, but the sooner you can accept who you are, the better you and everyone in your orbit will feel.


Show him that you don't need him to feel good about yourself. You should be happy pursuing your own hobbies, hanging out with your girlfriends, and having a great time without him. You can't bank all of your happiness on your relationship, can you?

, Give your man an intimate touch from time to time. Whether you're putting your hand on his arm, draping yourself across his lap, kissing him on the cheek, or playing with his hair, it's important to touch your man every single day to develop your bond. Even if you've come home from work feeling tired, just a little bit of touch will make you two feel more connected, even if you're too tired to have a real conversation. Try a little bit of cuddling in the morning, holding hands, or just playfully touching each other as much as you can. This will definitely show that you love your man.


Sure, a lot of guys aren't into PDA or don't love cuddling, but touching him will be better for both of you!

, If you really want to love your man, then you have to always keep up the romantic chase in your relationship. Don't get all cozy and settled in and think that you don't have to work for anything anymore. Get dressed up on your date nights. Write him little romantic notes before you leave for work. Send him cute text messages. Buy him a small gift just because you're thinking of him. Have exciting sex and get pleasure just from sharing a simple kiss with him. Remember that you should take nothing for granted in this world, and if you really want to love your man, then you always have to work for it -- and to make him work for it, too!


Though you don't have to play too hard to get if you're really happy together, never get complacent in your relationship. Always keep things exciting, new, and special.
Keep your relationship fresh by doing new things together, from traveling to new locations to trying new hobbies. It's important to keep things feeling new if you want to really love your man!

Ask your friends for feedback.,
Be sure your family likes them.,
Be a better person because of them.,
Apologize and mean it.,
Be yourself around them.",How to Know when You Love Him or Her1," When you love someone, immediately you want to introduce them to your friends. When you do introduce them, ask your friends for their honest opinions about your love interest. Your friends might be able to be more objective than you and help you identify whether you seem in love or merely infatuated.


It’s important before embarking on a new relationship to have at least some approval from your friends. Your friends know you and care about you, and it’s a red flag if everyone but you is skeptical of your new love.;
, As with your friends, your family can help you discern whether your crush is a good fit for you and whether what you’re experiencing is love. Love builds you up and is long-lasting. Lust or a passing crush fades, and your family can help you tell the difference.


Ask your parents, grandparents, or aunts and uncles how they knew that they found the right person. Their unique stories might help you get a better understanding of whether your own situation is love or something else.

, When being around this person makes you want to be the best person you can be, it is a sign of love.


For example, if this person makes you want to better yourself by working out or taking up a mutual hobby that interests both of you, it’s a sign that you love them. Wanting to improve yourself for someone often means that you love them.
Note that this is not the same as loving someone who is trying to change you into someone you’re not. It’s healthy to want to better yourself to be the best possible partner for someone you love. It’s a red flag if someone you love is trying to force you to change instead of loving you for you.

, When you accidentally hurt someone you love, you will apologize and mean it. If you don’t really love the person, your apology might feel half-hearted. Truly wanting forgiveness and meaning it when you apologize is a sign that this person means a lot to you and you’re in love., Once you’re past the initial “crush” phase, if you find that you can be yourself around this person, that’s a good sign that you’re in love. When you can let down your guard and that person still accepts you as you are, you can be confident that you’re in love.If you feel comfortable enough to leave your makeup at home or wear pajamas for a movie night, for example, that’s a sign that you’re comfortable being yourself in the relationship and secure with your love.

Choose to do things for them.,
Think of them first.,
Envision long-term plans with them.,
Have an attraction to them.,
Avoid hateful fighting.",How to Know when You Love Him or Her2," Performing acts of service is a clear way to demonstrate love for someone. If you find yourself wanting to do things for your partner just for the purpose of making them happy, that’s a good indicator that you’re in love with them.For example, if you know that your crush hates to do the dishes, so you opt to do the dishes simply so they won’t have to do a chore that they hate, you probably love the person.

, True love isn’t selfish. If you find yourself in a relationship where you ask yourself what you’ll get out of it, then you’re probably not in love with the person. However, if you find yourself thinking of the other person’s wants and needs before your own, that’s a sign that you’re in love.


Going shopping or attending sporting events with your crush, even when they're not your favorite things to do, are signs that you love them. Going the extra mile for our partner is something we do when we're truly in love.

, When you have a passing attraction to someone, it’s really hard to picture your future with that person. When you love someone, though, it’s easy to imagine them as a part of your future plans. In fact, it’s often hard to picture your future without them in it!Consider whether you have similar life goals. For example, do you want children with this person? Can you envision taking care of this person in old age? If you think of long term questions like these and find that you want your partner to be a permanent part of your life, then that means you're likely in love with them., Of course, physical attraction can’t be the only factor to decide whether you love someone, but overall attraction is an important consideration. If you find yourself attracted to someone physically, mentally, and emotionally, that’s a good sign that you’re in love with them.

, All couples have disputes, but if you love your partner, then you will fight fair and avoid purposely hurting them. You might be more careless with friends, family, or even a temporary fling, but if you’re in love with someone, you’ll take their feelings into account, even during fights."
"
Spend time with them.,
Miss them during the day.,
Feel a little jealous.,
Become best friends.,
Don't always be on the hunt for love.",How to Know when You Love Him or Her3," When you love someone, you want to spend as much time as possible with them. You hate to see them leave, even if only for a little while., Even small things like trips to the grocery store together or gardening side by side seem fun when you’re in love. Pay attention to whether you love spending time with them or if you feel relief when they leave. If it’s really love, you’ll be sad to see them go.

, When you love someone, you’ll feel slight jealousy. You don’t want them to be with anyone else, so this is a natural emotion. Slight jealousy is completely normal and shows that you love them and want that feeling to be mutual.


Possessiveness and suspicion are not the same as feeling little twinges of jealousy when your crush spends time away from you. These are indicative of insecurity and are never good for a relationship., When you like someone, you probably like hanging out with them, but when you truly love someone, you develop a “best friends” kind of connection with them. You don’t get tired of their company. You connect with them on a deeper level and share personal, intimate details of your life that you don’t share with everyone.A close, personal friendship with your partner is an indicator that you are in love with them. If you support each other and still challenge each other to grow spiritually and mentally, that's a sign of deep love., Avoid constantly looking for someone to love. You'll know when you find someone you truly love, and it'll feel natural. You can't rush or force love.


Don't feel like you have to find romantic love to be happy, and avoid clinging to someone who doesn't reciprocate your love.

Try to read her body language when you're together.,
Check if she avoids making eye contact with you.,
See if she treats you different when it's just the two of you versus when you're in public.,
Watch her reaction when you tell a funny story.,
Notice if your dates always turn into group hangouts.",How to Know when She Just Isn't Interested in You1," People are usually very aware of their facial expressions, but they don't necessarily realize that their bodies are sending pretty loud messages, too. She may be giving you hints that she's not interested in the way she positions her body.If she turns her body away from you, or leans back or away from you, it's a sign she may be uncomfortable.She keeps a barrier between you. If she always positions herself behind a chair or a table or holds her purse or backpack in front of her like a shield, she might not be interested in you.If she walks away when she sees you or appears to be avoiding you, she is not interested and you should not try to follow.;
, Making eye contact can actually be quite intimate, and some girls may look down or away because they are shy. But if you find that her eyes are always darting around when you talk to her, as though she's looking for her friends, she not really feeling the conversation and you should politely excuse yourself.Remember that one conversation during which she seems distracted or isn't looking at you doesn't mean she doesn't like you. But if it seems to happen every single time you try to talk to her, something is up.

, She's flirty and talkative during class or when you have a shift together at work. Then you run into her when she's out with her friends, and she looks right through you. If there's a huge gap between how she treats you in private and in front of her friends, she might just be flirting with you out of convenience.She might also be too self-conscious or shy to say hello to you in front of all of her friends. Are her friends are constantly glancing at you, even if she's not? It might mean she's talked about you to her friends.
Try making the first move and see how she reacts. Say hello when you see her out in public. If she seems embarrassed, is rude, or flat out ignores you, then you can be pretty sure she's not interested.

, Even if it's not that funny, a girl will usually laugh when a guy she likes makes a joke. Keep in mind, this is something most friends do, too, so it doesn't automatically mean she's into you. But if she doesn't even giggle at your funniest stories, you might need to find someone else who appreciates your humor.If she doesn't crack a smile at your joke, it could be because she's having a bad day (or it was a terrible joke). But if your jokes are met with silence day after day, then it's time to move on.

, If you ask her to the movies and she shows up with three friends, it might be a miscommunication. But if it happens every time you invite her to do something, it might be her way of letting you know she just wants to be your friend.Keep in mind some girls are not allowed to date until a certain age, and she may need her friends to tag along so her parents will let her hang out with you. But she should definitely let you know ahead of time that this won't be a solo hang.

Be aware if she only talks to you when she needs something.,
Take the hint if she says you are like her brother.,
Pay attention to how often she asks you questions about yourself and how much she talks about herself.",How to Know when She Just Isn't Interested in You2," If you only hear from her when she needs help with her homework or a project, or she needs a ride somewhere, but she doesn't have time to talk to you or she's always too busy to hang out, she might be manipulating you and not truly interested in you.Relationships go two ways--one person should not always be giving or doing things for the other person and get nothing in return.

, While this means you two are close and she has genuine affection for you, it's unlikely she sees you as anything beyond a good friend. Saying you think of someone as a sibling is basically removing any romantic possibilities from the equation.Even if there's not a chance for romance, a girl who describes you this way definitely values your presence in her life.

, If you can hardly get a word in because she's talking about what she was doing last weekend, her plans for winter break, then gossiping about her friend, and she has yet to ask about your weekend, she's probably more into herself than she's into you.If you know all the details of her life but she struggles to remember even the most basic things about you, she's likely not interested in you, but she's probably not a very good friend, either.
If she doesn't ask you a lot questions about yourself but she already seems to know a lot about you, then she's probably interested in you. It's likely she's been asking her friends about you and paying attention to the sports or clubs you are involved in. Try telling her something surprising about yourself and see how she reacts.

"
"
Decide if you can just be her friend.,
Give her some space.,
Accept it and move on.",How to Know when She Just Isn't Interested in You3," If she makes it clear that she only wants to be your friend, think about if you are okay with accepting that role in her life. If you think staying close to her and watching her possibly date other guys (and maybe even ask your advice about them) would be too painful, it's okay to say so. But if you think you can put your romantic feelings aside, be glad this rad girl wants you in her life and make the most of your friendship.


Don't stick around hoping she might change her mind. It's not fair to either of you if you are secretly hoping she'll fall for you if you do enough nice things for her. You'll be deceiving her and you'll be making yourself miserable.
If you are spending all your energy trying to convince her that you're the right person for her, you may be missing out on other girls that would love to date you.

, You may agonize over why she doesn't like you back, and you may want to ask her to explain it to you, or convince her that she's wrong, or tell her friends to tell her you'd make an amazing couple... but you should probably cool it. If you keep pursuing her when she's not interested, you may start to annoy her or even scare her.


You don't need to completely ignore her or be mean. Just take a few steps back and treat her more like an acquaintance.

, Just like you can't help having a crush on her, she can't force herself to have feelings for you. And while it definitely hurts, it's not the end of the world. It's completely okay to feel upset and sad when something doesn't work out. Luckily, she's not the only girl out there, and it probably won't be long until you meet someone new.


Chances are the girl just thought she was treating you like a friend and wasn't trying to lead you on. Try not to hold a grudge and just move forward.

Know that you focus on someone else's happiness, not just your own, when you are in love.,
Know that you do not need to share all the same interests to be in love.,
Be yourself with the person you love, and love them for being themselves as well.,
Know you may feel ""addicted"" to them when they aren't around.,
Know that loving someone doesn't mean you never fight.,
Ask yourself what love means to you.,
Know that love takes time to develop.,
Remember that not all love is romantic.",How to Know What It Means to Love Someone1," Being in love is about connecting with another person emotionally, caring for their happiness as if it was your own. When you love someone their fate becomes intertwined with yours. You may feel sad when they cry, get angry when they are hurt, and celebrate with their successes.If you can't wait to share good news with them or hear about their day, love is likely growing.This does not, however, mean that love is completely selfless. You should feel the same connection coming back to you as well.;
, You do not have to like all of the same things in order to love someone. In many cases, having differences allows your love to grow, as you share and teach each other parts about yourself that the other person never knew. Disliking someone's taste in music, for example, does not mean that you cannot love them.


Judgement, anger, or disrespect for each other's interests, however, may prevent love from really growing.

, When you allow someone to be exactly as they are, without any belief that they aren’t good enough, without any belief that they would be “better” if they were different, you're in love. Loving someone is about accepting them as they are, loving them despite, or even because of, their faults. No one is perfect, but they don't have to be for you to love them.


You may even learn more about yourself with this person, as loving them helps reveal truths about you that you might not have noticed before.If your love is dependent upon the other person acting and speaking how you want, then your feelings are conditional. We often confuse this with love, but this is just positive thoughts about someone. This is loving what a person says or does, not loving them.

, This is not just a turn of phrase: being in love actually changes your brain chemistry to ""reward"" you when they are in your life. If you are constantly thinking about them, missing them when they are gone, and finding ways to stay in contact with each other, love is likely blooming.This should be different, however, from obsession, when you think of them so much you cannot function on a day-to-day basis.
This desire to be with someone sometimes manifests itself as a fear of losing them, which is a natural part of love., Love in the real world, contrary to movies and TV, is not eternal sunshine and rainbows. Even people deeply in love will fight and argue, from parents and children to happily married couples. However, loving someone is about appreciating them even when you disagree. Little arguments and fights don't push you apart, and you are able to work back to common ground through careful communication. Even when you're angry or upset with them, you still love them, and these fights can often make you closer.

Love doesn't go away in an instant after one bad day. It may fade eventually, but it takes a lot of time. Love is a feeling, not an action, so don't look at what you're doing as much as what your feeling or thinking about.

, Everyone has different needs and wants in a relationship, and that leads everyone to a different definition of love. What do you need in a friend or lover? What do you offer? Have you ever felt like you were in love, and what did it feel like?


Love changes and grows with age: 20-somethings who just moved in together may have a different definition than a couple celebrating their 50th anniversary. This doesn't mean, however, that both couples don't love each other.
If you feel like you are in love, and the feeling lasts several weeks or months, you are likely in love.

, Love at first sight, though romantic, is not a real phenomenon. Attraction happens quickly, as does infatuation, but love takes time to develop. Love is based on an understanding of the other person emotionally and socially, and such an understanding cannot be rushed.


There is no ""right"" amount of time to fall in love, but you do need to be with someone long enough to feel like you understand them., Love is not just about sexual attraction or romance. Most people will happily admit that they love their families and best friends. Love is based on a deep relationship, a connection that lets you know you can trust someone completely. You understand them and they understand you -- not perfectly, but enough that you feel invested in each other's lives and happiness.

See if she's been getting more physical.,
See how things have progressed in the bedroom.,
See if she wants a lot of alone time.,
See if she invites you over.,
See if she tries to sleep over at your place.",How to Know if Your Girlfriend Wants to Have Sex With You1," If your girlfriend can't keep her hands off of you and is always touching you, has her arms around you, or wants you to hold her hand, put your arm around her, or even drape her across your lap, then she may be ready for more. If her actions have been getting more sexual -- like if she's touching your manhood through your pants, or placing your hands on her breasts -- then she may be ready for something more.


If she's more physical around you, then this means she's probably more comfortable around you. And she'll only have sex with you if she feels comfortable with you.
See how she dances with you. Does she get closer to your body than ever? She may be trying to tell you something.;
, It's unlikely that your girlfriend wants to have sex with you if you've never even French kissed. But if you've been making out for a while and have moved further than that, then it's more likely that she's ready to have sex. If you've touched her breasts, and if you've touched each others private parts or even received oral sex from her, then it's more likely -- though not guaranteed -- that she may be ready to move further with you.


Just because a girl gives you oral sex does not mean that she's ready to have sex with you. Some girls give oral sex way before they're ready to have sex, while others aren't comfortable giving oral sex until after sex -- or they don't give it at all. Every girl is different.
If you kiss for hours and your girl doesn't do anything more, she may either be waiting for you to make the next move, or she may really just not be ready to have sex. If she pushes you away every time you try to touch her breasts, take off her shirt, or touch her below the belt, then she is definitely not ready.

, If suddenly, your girlfriend's friends are nowhere to be found, and she wants to spend a lot of time alone with you, in one of your homes or bedrooms, then it's likely that she wants to get intimate -- to some degree. If she wasn't ready for sex, then she'd be more likely to avoid any uncomfortable situations where you're completely alone and wanting more than she can give you.

, If you've never been alone in her place before, and she invites you in, then she may be telling you she wants something more from you. If she conveniently picks a date night location near her place and then casually steers you in the direction of her home, then she may be telling you that she wants to get intimate. This takes some planning and foresight, so it's likely she's put a lot of thought into getting you alone in her place.

, If she's never slept over, but she comes over with a bigger bag that is likely to be an overnight bag, then she may be telling you that she wants something more. If she wants to spend some time in bed with you, then it's likely that she doesn't just want to sleep. Falling asleep next to a person can feel almost as intimate as sex, so if she's trying to stay at your place, she may be telling you she's ready for the next step.


This doesn't mean that she's ready for sex, but it does make it more likely that she wants to be intimate.

, A good relationship is based on teamwork, whether it's with your spouse, your little league coach or your work colleagues. A good team has a common goal. It knows its way to success is dependent on acknowledging the skills and abilities of each person, not insisting on things being done one way only.;
, Find a suitable name for your chosen higher principle. Call it love, truth, or spirituality. Connect with your higher principle regularly and in all beautiful or difficult situations. Live in the center of your relationship, guided by your higher principle.

, Do not demand too much from a partner, life or even from yourself. Anyone who cannot limit his or her wishes risks being permanently unhappy. If you do not know the point of satisfaction, you will never be satisfied. Where is your end point?

, Clarify the precise factual situation. Think about different solutions. Find the good common ground.


Put boundaries on the negative behaviors from partners and others in your life. Tantrums, violations of positive life principles, etc. are not acceptable ways to interact. Do not reward negative behavior––stay neutral or say a firm ""No"".
If you are an aggressive person, find a way to tone this down before interacting. Come to peace within yourself before communicating with others. Love grows on the basis of non-violence, wisdom and gentleness.

, Live in truth. Truth is the basis of every good relationship.


Take your partner as she or he is. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. No person is perfect. Love means to love the other person, along with his or her weaknesses. Accept the smallness in you, then you can take it in your fellow person.

Let the person know that you will always be there for them, no matter what.,
Schedule time to be together frequently.,
Compromise on arguments and decisions.,
Build trust together.,
Take care of yourself, by maintaining your own life and happiness outside of your loved one.,
Remain affectionate with each other.,
Break up your routines from time to time.,
Limit any jealous feelings by staying happy for your partner.",How to Know What It Means to Love Someone2," If they're having problems or are upset, show them that you care. Just listening to someone's concerns is often enough to assure them that you care. You don't need to fix all of your loved one's problems, you just need to be there for the bad times as well as the good.

, When you're in love with someone, spending time with them is not a chore or stress. You'll want to be with them, so making time to do activities together is no problem. Find things you love doing together and make time to do them -- the people you love should be a naturally high priority on your schedule.Spend time talking together, not just doing activities. You need to be able to listen and share your thoughts in order to maintain love and trust.

, You are not always right, and neither is your loved one. Being in love is about remembering how important you are together, not always trying to end up on top. While you should stay true to yourself, being in love means taking their point of view into account as well as yours.


What is there side of the story? Is there something you didn't realize?
Are you mad because of something that happened, or because you got too caught up in the argument?
Do you still love and respect them? This is more important than a ""winner"" of any argument., Loving someone requires a degree of vulnerability. You have to be willing to open up about yourself, sharing the good times and asking for support during the bad. This, though difficult at first, is crucial to having a happy, loving relationship. Trusting each other deepens your bond together and allows you to grow and evolve, and your love will evolve accordingly. You need to know what your partner wants and needs, and they need to know you, in order to keep your love alive.

Trust is not just about talking, it is about listening carefully.
Be open and honest about your schedule and life. Hiding things often leads to painful reveals later on.

, You need, above all, to take care of yourself in order to take care of someone else. Try not to ""lose"" yourself by neglecting your friends or old hobbies once you fall in love. Remember, being in love does not mean you do everything together, it means you respect each other for who you are. Some healthy ideas include:


Take some occasional time apart-- if you are in love, it will not be destroyed by a few weeks alone.
Hang out with your friends, especially friends from before the relationship began. These friendships are not unimportant now that you're in love.
Develop personal hobbies or interests that you can eventually share, or use to have ""me"" time when you need a moment to relax., Just because you've been together for a while does not mean that a hug, a kiss, or a nice letter sent to each other can't keep the bonds of love strong. Remember that love takes effort to maintain, but it shouldn't be hard. Show your love and affection from time to time to keep the love alive., Predictability is the bane of many relationships, as you fall into a groove and feel ""trapped"" or upset. A degree of surprise is essential to keep your love going strong, but that doesn't mean you need to shake everything up every few months. A few surprises here and there shows that you care enough about each other to spice things up and think about each other.


Take a vacation, even if just for a long weekend.
Make time to see each other once a week, but make it somewhere new each time.
Go to a class or seminar together to pick up a new hobby.
Make new friends by inviting other couples over for drinks or dinner.
Start a project together, like a book, garden, painting, etc., It is natural and acceptable to feel jealous at times. However, when one loves another, jealousy doesn't take up too much space in the heart. If the other finds a new romantic partner, gets their dream job, or is a better cook than you, you should take pride in their happiness. Feelings of anger or jealousy are natural, but they should not overshadow your relationship. A part of you should be genuinely happy for the other one's life successes.


Jealousy is actually healthy in small amounts -- it becomes dangerous, however, when it morphs into suspicion."
"
Know that, sometimes, love fades naturally.,
Know that you should want to spend time together, not feel obligated.,
Know that making plans without thinking about your partner is an early sign that you are losing love.,
Notice if signs of intimacy or affection have faded.,
End a relationship if you don't feel like you love someone anymore.",How to Know What It Means to Love Someone3," Not all love can last. Whether it is because you are fighting more often than usual, life moves you apart, or your interests slowly drift away, some couples fall out of love. The spark cannot stay alive always, and though it hurts to break off a loving relationship, sometimes it is for the best., Love is not an obligation. You should want to willingly spend free time with someone you love, and if you do not you need to examine why things are different now. Do you just need some time alone, or is there a more serious issue in your relationship?


Everyone has times they hope to be alone, but this is different from constantly ignoring or regretting the time with the one you love.
You should never feel exhausted or sad after spending time together., This is not about planning what to do for lunch, but bigger life goals. If you begin prioritizing your life without thinking about where your partner fits into the picture, you've lost the feelings of commitment necessarily to stay in love. Being in love with someone means they are on your mind and a part of your foreseeable future., This is true of all love, romantic and otherwise. If you no longer want to touch, tell each other what you enjoy about each other, be near each other, or have a conversation, then something is up. Again, these things are easy when you are in love, but can feel strained or even embarrassing when your love fades.

, It is often as simple as asking yourself, ""Do I feel in love anymore?"" You might not be able to point to a reason or flaw that caused your to fall out of love, but this is an unfortunate fact of life. People grow and change, and sometimes they grow apart. While you may still like the person, the love may be gone, and it is unlikely to come back once it has faded.

It may be hard to break-up with someone, but trying to fake or force your love will only lead to more pain down the road.

Be prepared.,
Get intimate.,
Ask if she's ready.,
React appropriately.",How to Know if Your Girlfriend Wants to Have Sex With You2," If you plan on asking your girlfriend if she wants to have sex, then you should do it in an intimate setting -- not while you're splitting a cheeseburger. So, if you're ready to have sex, and it turns out that she's ready to have sex, then what does this mean? Condoms. Don't show up at her place, or invite her to yours, knowing that there's a chance you'll have sex without being prepared.


Don't show the condoms to her or creep her out, but have them at your disposal just in case she is ready. Nothing will ruin an intimate moment more than a trip to the drugstore.

, Once you're prepared for action, you should reach a point where you're intimate with your lady. This means you should take her out, make her feel special, and then get some time alone with her. How intimate do you have to be? This depends on how fast things progress. If you're already in the bedroom and part -- or most -- of your clothes are off, then it is time to ask her for confirmation that she is ready to take things to the next level.


If you're just kissing on the couch and she doesn't make any more moves, it may be too soon to ask.

, When the time is right, stroke your woman, look into her eyes, and say, ""Are you ready?"" Don't say, ""Wanna have sex?"" or ""Wanna get it on?"" Or she won't take you seriously. Make it clear that you're asking whether or not she's ready for sex, and wait for a response. She'll appreciate that you can be subtle and open at the same time.


Obviously, make sure your girl is sober when this decision is made. The worst thing you can do is pressure her into doing something she'll regret later when you're both under the influence.

, If she says she's ready for sex, then do a private cheer, get your condoms, and get ready to get it on. And if she says she's not ready, respect her decision and let her know that you're perfectly cool with that. Tell her she's worth the wait and that she can take all the time she needs. Be a gentleman. If you get angry or try to pressure her, then she'll be second guessing your relationship right away.


If she says no, cool it for a while. Don't ask her if she wants to have sex every time you give her a peck on the lips. That will get old fast. Never rush.

See if she's talking about sex more often.,
See if she gives you sexual compliments.,
See if she talks about your bed a lot.,
See if she just tells you she's turned on.,
See if she talks dirty.",How to Know if Your Girlfriend Wants to Have Sex With You3," If your girlfriend is ready to take the next step with you, it's likely that she'll be talking about sex more. She can do this in a lot of different ways, from talking about your friends who just started having sex, to casually asking your opinion on sexual topics. If the word ""sex"" is on the tip of her tongue, then it's obviously on her mind.If she mentions sex while you're alone together, then it's even more likely that she wants to have sex with you.
If she's suddenly very curious about which of your friends are having sex and which aren't, then she may be wondering when you two will have sex too.

, If she tells you that you have a great chest, sexy biceps, or amazing abs, then she's hinting that your body turns her on. Instead of telling you that she likes your shirt or that you have a great haircut, she's choosing to let you know that she notices your body -- and may be thinking about all of the things it can do for her.


If she gives you these compliments while you're kissing or being intimate, then it's even more likely that she may want to take the next step.

, If she comes over, pats your bed, and says it's ""really comfortable,"" then she may be hinting that she wants to lie down on it with you. If she even does lie on the bed and talk about how great it is, then she wants you to join her as soon as possible.

, This is a pretty bold move, but yes, your lady may just tell you that she's in the mood, feeling frisky, or just wants to hook up. This doesn't necessarily mean that she wants to have sex, but if she's comfortable enough to tell you that she's in the mood for something intimate, then it's not a leap that she may want to have sex with you.

, If your girlfriend has started talking dirty to you over the phone, sending you dirty texts, talking dirty when you're making out or doing something more, or even having phone sex with you, then she may be ready to take it to the next level. Of course, this could all just be talk, but if she's comfortable enough with herself and you to go this far, then she may be ready for more.

Think about when you began questioning your feelings.,
Assess your actions toward your partner.,
Imagine a future without this person.,
Remember why the relationship ended.,
Weigh the pros and cons of being with this person.,
Be brutally honest with yourself about your motivation.,
Take some space away from this person.,
Discuss your feelings with the person, if appropriate.,
Choose a plan and stick to it.",How to Know if You Still Love Someone," Feelings don’t change overnight. It probably took you awhile to fall in love and establish a devoted relationship with your partner. Give yourself enough time to interpret your feelings, because you can irreparably damage your relationship if you act too quickly.Don’t feel guilty by giving yourself some time to unpack all of your emotions, and don’t try to rush to have it all figured out.


Consider what else was happening when you started questioning your feelings. Have other factors changed in your life? Maybe you started a new job, and you're constantly exhausted. Maybe family troubles are causing a strain on the relationship. Make sure you recognize if your apathy or confusion about the relationship stems from the natural ups and downs of life, rather than feelings toward your partner.;
, Consider things like your patience and physical attraction levels. Have you been snapping at them out of irritation more often recently? Has your interest in physical intimacy decreased? Maybe you’ve started needing more and more space away from them. These, of course, are all red flags. It’s normal for a relationship to cool off a bit as the honeymoon stage ends, but it shouldn’t become cold!Take note of how often you reject your partner’s advances, criticize them, lose patience with them, and so on. If you find that you’re doing these things more often than not, you probably need to take a hard, honest look at your relationship.

, You need to do this before you take any sort of decisive action. When you think about your future in an ideal world, is this person a part of it? Sometimes we take our loved ones for granted, even if they are the most important person in our lives. We don’t realize that their absence would shatter our world as we know it. Be completely honest with yourself when you picture moving on without them— would your life suffer or flourish?


Any breakup is hard, because it means stepping outside of your comfort zone and losing someone you once cared about. However, imagine life after the initial discomfort. Would you be happier on your own? Would you be happier with someone else?
Recognize that being comfortable with someone doesn’t necessarily mean you love them.

, If your relationship has already ended and you’re questioning if your love is still there, make sure you remember what caused the breakup. It’s easy to look back and romanticize an old relationship, but don’t overlook reality. Sometimes people simply gave up too quickly without attempting to work out their problems. However, sometimes there are fundamental problems that just cannot be fixed.If the relationship ended because someone made a mistake, it is important to determine if you can truly forgive and forget. You can’t create a future with someone if you are stuck in the issues of the past.
Similarly, nothing will change about your relationship of no one has changed. If you broke up with your partner because you didn't trust them, either they need to have become trustworthy or you need to have become trusting. Past issues don't just disappear.

, Try to determine how your overall quality of life changes when you are with them and without them. If they become your #1 priority and your work performance, family relationships, and self-care all fall to the wayside, it may not be a healthy relationship.However, if you truly feel like a better person when you’re with them, that’s something you don’t want to slip away.


Write it all down so you can truly see if the positives outweigh the negatives. Don’t hold back!

, Are you debating going back to this person because you are lonely? Loneliness, though painful and debilitating, is not a reason to be with someone. Jealousy is another powerful emotion that can make you start pining for an ex, but don't fight for them back just because you don't want to see them with someone else. That is not the foundation of a healthy and long-lasting relationship.If you can say with certainty loneliness, jealousy, boredom, or any other superficial emotion isn't the reason you're considering rekindling your romance, you may still love this person.

, Take time to do the things that make you happy, and anything that helps you clear your head. If you haven’t spent much time away from your partner before, this is a good opportunity to get a taste of what life would be like without them. It can also help you unwind and determine if stress was causing you to question your relationship. Not only can some alone time help you sort out your feelings without any pressure from your partner, but it will give you time to compose yourself and decide exactly how to proceed.

, If you’re currently in the relationship, use tact when speaking with your partner. Begin your sentences with “I” rather than “you,"" because you don't want to sound accusatory or hurtful. Instead, discuss how you’ve been feeling in the relationship.If you aren’t currently in a relationship with this person, decide if communicating your feelings is appropriate. It may not be appropriate if it could toy with their emotions, or if they have a new partner.


Once you decide to start voicing your feelings, things may get complicated. Don’t do this unless you’re sure it is something that needs to be addressed.
Often times it is easier to write your feelings down so that you can say everything you need to say. Writing a letter can be a great way to communicate with your current or past partner.

, In other words, get yourself out of the awful gray area. If, after all of this, you want to stay together (or get back together), then do so wholeheartedly. If you want to break up, do so completely. You have to commit fully to whatever you choose! If you are in a relationship yet constantly doubting it, your relationship will suffer. You can’t have one foot out the door and expect love to flourish. On the other hand, if you decide you do not love the person, you must end things completely. You will not be able to start a new, independent life if you continue to ask “what if?”"

Play the well known ""Favorites"" game.,
Talk about what kind of pets you two like.,
Think about both of your opinions on health, food, and well-being.,

Know how you both feel about children (and your opinions on how to raise them).,
Understand both your thoughts on a wedding and honeymoon.,
Think about your opinions on sex.,
Listen to your intuition.",How to Know Whether You're Compatible," You each take turns asking the other about random things like ""favorite books"", ""favorite movies"", et cetera. This isn't the most important thing to know, but it helps a couple connect.;
, If you have totally different tastes in pets, this can make eventually settling down with this person a bit more difficult and maybe unpleasant.

, If you ever end up living with this person, this is important so you can agree on things like dinners and medicine.

, Morals, convictions and beliefs are a very important thing to consider. If you can't accept the other person's religion and ethical views, then starting a family with them is going to be a very hard task. Things like places of worship to attend (churches, temples, meeting houses, et cetera) are best spent together on that sabbath morning.

, Holidays and celebrations could also fall under the above category. Say your partner was Christian, and you were Taoist. Your partner might want a huge celebration on Christmas, with a tree and everything, but you may want to just have it be a normal day. Most people could accept their partner's views on this topic, but some can't handle it.

, If you despise your mother-in-law, or if your husband's friends are total slobs, living in a house where these people visit every once in a while isn't going to be pleasant.

, From the number of children, to how you raise them, to what their names should be (if you're like most couples, you figured that one out in middle school), children aren't an easy topic to agree on.

, Hopefully if you don't agree you can come to a compromise, traditionally based towards the bride's family's views. Some families believe weddings should be small and only invite the people very close to the two families, and others like weddings to be huge and extravagant.

, Some believe sex is post-marital only, some take it a little more lightly. Some even like it a bit more... unorthodox. You might not want to make love to someone who's already been there before. Talk to your partner about this.

, Make sure you feel good about the decisions you are making.

Do you feel like your boyfriend truly understands you? Do you think he knows your needs and wants? If not, he may be disrespecting you.You may feel like your boyfriend does not know basic things about you, such as personal boundaries and what you like to do. This may be because he talks over you or dismisses you.
Listening is a basic sign of respect. Someone who does not listen to you does not likely respect you.;
, Think about how you feel about your role in the relationship. Disrespectful people will often make their partners feel unworthy. In a healthy relationship, you will feel you deserve love and respect.You may find yourself consistently having thoughts like, ""I don't deserve him"" or ""It's my fault he yells. I don't deserve to be treated well.""
You do deserve respect. Every human deserve as much. If you consistently feel unworthy of basic aspects of respect (being listened to, being treated with kindness, having your needs met, etc.) then your boyfriend may be being disrespectful towards you.

, Disrespectful people can create toxic relationships with those around them. If you're being perpetually disrespected, think about your overall energy level. Do you feel tired most of the time? Do you feel drained and exhausted? If so, your boyfriend may be disrespecting you., A disrespectful partner can affect how you behave. If you're with someone who doesn't respect you, you may often feel like you're at your worst.Do you feel like you're not the person you used to be? Do you feel like you're no longer able to keep up with things like your friends, hobbies, and social life and are just doing the bare minimum?
Do you feel like you're not dealing as well in social interactions? Maybe you've been more short tempered or dismissive lately. This is a sign you're not being respected and lashing out at others.

, No one is perfect. It's normal for a romantic partner to sometimes point out your flaws if they affect him or the relationship. However, a disrespectful partner will lecture you constantly about even minor, inconsequential flaws. He will also sound less concerned and more demeaning.In a respectful relationship, your boyfriend may say something like, ""Could you not text as much while we watch TV? I just like to have you present.""
If your boyfriend is being disrespectful, his reaction will be more over the top. Instead of asking nicely that you don't text during certain times, he will lash out and start lecturing you about your flaws. For example, ""This just shows how you can't concentrate on anything. I think this is why you've been having so much trouble at school lately. Your professors are probably as frustrated with you as I am.""

, A disrespectful boyfriend is often very controlling and domineering in his behavior. During interactions, you may feel your boyfriend will not let you have your way. He may have an ""It's my way or the highway"" mentality, and act out when things don't go the way he wants.A disrespectful boyfriend may, for example, take major issue with you seeing friends without him. He may berate you and question this decision, saying things like, ""Your friends are so boring. Why do you need to see them so much?""
While he may not directly forbid you from going, he may do things to make your night difficult. For example, he allows you to see a movie with your friend Maggie, but texts and calls the whole time in the theater. He may also let you grab coffee with a friend, but cold shoulder you when you get home.

, Compromise is important to any healthy relationship. Your boyfriend should occasionally be willing to meet your needs, just as you've met his. You may feel like you always end up doing things your partner's way, whether you want to or not.In a normal relationship, people compromise on things like taste. You may, for example, go see a movie you don't really want to see, but then eat dinner at your favorite restaurant afterwards.
With a disrespectful boyfriend, everything will be about him. If you try to say ""No"" or offer a compromise, he simply berates you until he gets his way. For example, he wants to go hiking for your anniversary. You're not much of a hiker, but propose a short, easy hike as you've never gone before. Instead of agreeing, he keeps complaining that he loves long hikes and a short hike will be boring for him until you eventually agree to go on the shorter hike.

, Is your boyfriend quick to anger? Does he create a generally hostile atmosphere in your home? If you feel unsafe when around him, and feel as if you need to walk on eggshells constantly, he may be disrespecting you., A chronically disrespectful person will not own up to the fact his behavior has hurt others. Most people apologize for their shortcomings or try to change them. A disrespectful person will never take full responsibility for himself.Your boyfriend may refuse to apologize for even little things. For example, he's consistently late but is always making excuses such as ""There was traffic"" and ""I was stressed, so I lost track of time.""
He may also make excuses for major aspects of disrespect. For example, ""I'm sorry I yelled at you, but you don't get the pressure I've been under lately."" He may even go as far as to blame you. For example, ""I would be more respectful about you seeing your friends if I felt more valued in the relationship.""

, If you feel your boyfriend is being disrespectful, learn to assert yourself. In the moment the disrespect occurs, let him know you will not tolerate it. You do not have to be aggressive or mean. Simply state your needs in a calm fashion When your boyfriend is being difficult, say so in the moment. Calmly let him know what he's saying is not respectful and you don't appreciate it. Do this in a calm fashion to avoid escalating the argument.
For example, your boyfriend is on your case about you going out with friends from work because he feels these friends are not responsible. Say something like, ""I appreciate your concerns, but I know how to stay safe. I'm allowed to have a social life and I need you to respect that.""

, If your boyfriend is chronically disrespectful, he may not always listen when you assert yourself. Instead of hearing your needs and backing off, he may become hostile or even aggressive. For example, ""I don't care what you think you need. I don't want you going out with those girls from the office."" In this case, just walk away.You need to back up your words with behavior. If you want your boyfriend to respect your social life, and he isn't, show him you won't tolerate this lack of respect.
Say something like, ""You're not listening to me and this isn't getting us anywhere. I'm going for a walk."" Then, leave for a few hours to give your boyfriend a chance to calm down.

, Living with a chronically disrespectful person can drain your self esteem. You may start to feel you are not worth things like love and respect. This is not the case. Everyone has worth, so remind yourself of yours when necessary.Most people have some areas in their lives they could use to improve. However, this does not mean you don't deserve love or respect. Just because you're, say, a little messy does not give your boyfriend the right to yell at or berate you constantly.
Remind yourself of of this. Adopt a personal mantra. Try something like, ""I matter. I deserve respect. I deserve love.""

, If someone keeps disrespecting you, you don't have to stay in the relationship. If you consistently feel controlled, uncomfortable, or unhappy with someone, the relationship is probably not worth your time. There's nothing wrong with walking away if someone is not respecting you."

Make sure your expectations aren’t too high.",How to Know It's the Right Time to Have Sex," If you feel like you and your partner can’t even bring up the topic of sex, then it’s likely that you’re not ready for that phase of the relationship. Though you may think that sex can only happen naturally if you get carried away by the moment, it’s actually quite important for you to be able to comfortably talk to your partner about it before you move forward to make sure you’re on the same page.


You should feel comfortable saying something like, “I’m starting to feel ready to have sex with you. But before we do that, I just want to talk about a few things first. Is that okay?” If it seems unthinkable that you could do this with your partner, then you may be better off waiting.
You should talk to your partner about things like whether or not you’ll be sleeping with other people, what protection you’ll be using, and where your relationship stands.
Even if your relationship is more casual and you do have other sexual partners currently, it’s important to talk about this so your partner doesn’t feel blindsided.;
, Another important aspect to consider before you have sex with your partner is whether or not you’re in the same place when it comes to your feelings. It may feel like a big emotional commitment to have sex for you, while your partner may not look at it that way, and vice versa. If having sex means that you’re really into your partner and want to take your relationship to a deeper level, then it’s important to be sure that he or she feels the same way before you move on.


Though it can be awkward to ask your partner where he or she stands when it comes to your relationship, this can help you get a better sense of the situation. Besides, it’s much less painful to hear that your partner doesn’t quite feel the same way you do before you have sex instead of learning the truth afterwards.
You don’t have to feel like you’re falling in love with your partner before you have sex, but if you do have strong feelings, then it’s important to know that your partner feels the same way. And if you don’t have strong feelings, then it’s also good to make sure your partner is aware of this so you don’t end up hurting him or her.

, Be honest with yourself. If you want to have sex with your partner because you think it will make him or her more likely to call you his or her boyfriend or girlfriend, then you should probably hold off. While sex is a wonderful component of many healthy serious relationships, you can’t think that having sex will be your ticket to having a stronger connection with your partner. Instead, your connection should already be strong, and you should naturally feel ready for sex because of that.If you’re feeling insecure about the relationship, then ask yourself where this is coming from. If you feel like your partner just isn’t as serious about the relationship as you are, then sex isn’t the way to take things to the next level.

, People have different rules and ideas when it comes to knowing it’s the right time to have sex. When people are casually dating, some of them are comfortable sleeping with multiple people at once—as long as they are staying as safe as they can. However, other people don’t want to have sex with someone if that person is also sleeping with other people; even if they aren’t at the boyfriend-girlfriend level, they don’t want to feel compromised. If you want to be the only person your partner is sleeping with, then your best is to ask your partner where you stand.


Again, though this may feel awkward, especially if you’re not quite boyfriend-girlfriend yet, asking this question bluntly can give you a better sense of the situation.

, Some people have a set timeline when it comes to having sex with a new partner; some do it after four dates, some wait two months, or some have sex on the first night if they are really feeling it. Though you may be looking for a quick answer for when it’s right to have sex, you have to know that this depends on your individual preferences, as well as on how the relationship is going. There’s no “one size fits all” answer.Some relationships move forward a lot faster than others. If you see your partner a lot and feel like you really click right away and truly get each other, then you’ll likely be ready to have sex more quickly than if you only go on dates every two weeks over the course of a few months.
Some relationships are also a lot more physical than others. If you and your partner get into some hot and heavy kissing and touching sessions early on, then you may be more ready for sex than you would be with a more slow-moving relationship.
As much as you may hate hearing it, a lot of the time, when you’re ready for sex, you just know. You feel a connection with your partner and really want to take it to the next level, and a formula or timeline won’t help you very much, most of the time.

, One way to make sure that it’s the right time to have sex is to ask yourself if you really trust your partner. Now, you don’t have to trust him or her with your life, but you should feel comfortable confiding in that person, sharing a part of yourself with him or her, and letting him or her get intimate with your body. If you feel like you’re not really sure where your partner stands or if you can depend on him, then it may not be the right time for sex.


Ask yourself if you feel comfortable confiding in your partner and think that your secrets and thoughts are safe with him or her.
If you suspect that your partner is just trying to get close to you for sex, then you obviously can’t trust that person.

, This is another important point. If you don’t feel like your relationship is very mature—whether you and your partner are fighting all the time, constantly blowing each other off, or resorting to name calling—then you should definitely not try to make things feel more adult by having sex. You should feel like you have a respectful relationship with strong communication before you take it to the next level.


If you two aren’t mature enough to have a civil conversation or to talk about any serious topics, then you’re not mature enough for sex.
You should feel comfortable being mature with your partner before you get intimate. Otherwise, he or she may not take intimacy very seriously and having sex can drive you even further apart.
Furthermore, you should make sure that you’re mature enough for sex. If you’re a teen, especially in your early teens, then you have to make sure you’re really ready.

, Some people simply don’t believe in having sex before marriage, whether it’s for personal or for religious reasons. If this has been your belief your whole life, then you should ask yourself if you want to rethink these ideas before you move forward with your partner. It’s okay to change your mind, but it’s important that you put a lot of thought into it so you don’t feel disappointed in yourself if you make the decision in the heat of the moment.


If your partner’s religious or personal beliefs lead him to not believe in sex before marriage, then you shouldn’t try to convince him to change his or her mind. Your partner should make this decision on his own and you don’t want to be responsible for persuading him to change his long-held beliefs.

, Ask yourself if you want to know whether it’s the right time to have sex because you’re really ready to be sexually active with your partner or because you feel pressured to do so because you’ve been together for a while, because your partner keeps asking about it, or even because everyone you know is asking if you’ve done it yet. You should have sex because you want to, not because anyone else wants you to.


Of course, if your partner really wants to have sex with you, then this has probably come up. But if you feel inappropriate pressure to do something you’re not ready for, then you should ask yourself if your partner really cares for and respects you.
Just because all of your friends might have had sex already or might have slept with their partners much sooner than you’re considering does not mean this is the right path for you. You have to follow your own ideas of what is appropriate.

, Now, if you’ve never had sex before, then you may be especially nervous about knowing when it’s the right time to take the plunge. Yes, having sex for the first time is likely something you’ll remember forever and you probably won’t ever fully forget the first person you had sex with. That said, you shouldn’t put so much pressure on yourself to find the perfect moment and expect it to be magical; instead, you should do it when you feel the time is right, not after you’ve been led to a bed with rose petals on it.


If it’s your first time, then you should let your partner know, even if you’re embarrassed about it. Your partner will see that this is a big deal to you and will understand that you need to be on the same page. If you want losing your virginity to mean that you really care for the person you have sex with, then you have to make sure the person cares for you.
That said, if you feel like your virginity is an albatross around your neck and are ready to get frisky without it meaning you’ve found your soulmate, then that’s fine, too. You don’t have to want the first time to be absolutely meaningful. If you have that attitude, you may wait forever to have sex for the first time.

, This one may seem obvious for men—if your penis is erect, then you can start to have intercourse. But for girls who are inexperienced with sex, they need to make sure that their bodies are ready to move forward before they have sex. If you’re a girl, you may be so nervous or scared that you aren’t paying enough attention to your body; make sure you feel relaxed and wet enough to have sex without it being too painful or forcing it.


If you’re a girl who isn’t ready for penetration, let your partner know, and he can help you get to that point.
If you’re a girl who is having sex for the first time, it may hurt, even if you’re ready, so be prepared for that, and be prepared to ask your partner to stop if it’s hurting too much.

, If your instincts are telling you that it’s time to have sex and all of the other things are in place, then chances are that you’re ready. However, if you feel like it’s about time you should be having sex but get a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach or just feel that something is off when you think about getting intimate with your partner, or get close to being intimate, then you have to trust that feeling. Your instincts are more important than any timeline, anything your partner says, or any ideas you may have about what you “should” do, and if you have the feeling that something is wrong, then it probably is.


You may not realize that you don’t feel good about it until you get close to being intimate with your partner. When you start moving forward sexually, you may start to just feel like backing away, and you have the right to go with those feelings.

, It goes without saying that you should be sober when you and your partner have sex for the first time. Whether it’s your first time having sex, or just your first time having sex with your partner, it’s important to be sober so you can have a clear head and, more importantly, give legal consent to have sex. Though each state has different rules about what it means to be able to give consent, it’s important to be sober so you can make the decision with a clear head and enjoy this intimate moment with your partner.Though you may feel that getting drunk can help you ease your nervousness about having sex for the first time, this will actually impair your judgment and make the experience much less pleasant and memorable.

, You may be feeling that physical urge to have sex with your partner and may feel like you can’t fight it anymore. However, if your body is screaming “yes!” but your mind is whispering, “maybe…” then you should hold off until you feel like you have really thought it through. Though getting caught up in the moment can lead to a passionate experience, you don’t want to feel upset or disappointed when it’s over because you listened to your body and ignored your mind.To truly listen to your mind, make sure you think about having sex with your partner when he’s not around. That way, your judgment won’t be as affected by your physical longings, and you can think about the situation more objectively.

, Before you have sex with your partner, it’s important for you to be educated about pregnancy, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), birth control options, the legal age of consent in your state, and any other important aspects of the sexual experience. If you don’t know how condoms, birth control pills, IUDs, or other forms of birth control work, then it’s important to read up on the subject at reputable online sites such as Planned Parenthood. This can help you feel confident and savvy before you even think about sex.Though condoms are said to be 98% effective when used correctly, you and your partner should both know how to use them, especially if this is your only form of birth control.
If you’re taking the birth control pill, know that it does not protect you against STIs and that you and your partner should be tested before you have sex.
Don’t think that a girl “can’t” get pregnant during certain times of the month even if you don’t use birth control. You should always have a plan.

, In addition to being knowledgeable about birth control options, you have to make sure that you and your partner are in the same place when it comes to using protection. If you’re set on using a condom during sex, make sure your partner is 100% behind this and that he won’t try to convince you that it “feels better” without it. Though it may feel a little awkward to bring this up before sex, it’s far better than having an argument while you’re trying to have sex because you don’t agree about what to use.


Using condoms during oral sex can also prevent against STIs. This is something else you should discuss in advance. If you’re planning to have oral sex for the first time, make sure you’ve read up on that, too., If you’ve read up on all of the helpful materials but still feel unsure when it comes to sex, then you should talk to a close friend, a sibling, or even a parent or aunt or uncle for more advice. You may learn a few new things and may feel more comfortable when you see that everyone has fears and concerns when it comes to having sex. Just take the time to sit down with the people you care about and trust and discuss your questions and concerns with them.


Though these people can help ease your worries and give you helpful advice, know that they can’t ever tell you when is the right time to have sex. This is something that only you can know.

, You may think that once you’ve told your partner you’re ready to have sex, you have to go through with it, even if you’re having doubts right before it’s happening—or even after you’ve started. You can say “no” at absolutely any time and should never feel pressured to stick it out once you’ve said you would have sex. Your partner should be respectful of your choices and you should be more concerned about doing what you want than about letting your partner down.

For sex to be consensual, you have to give your consent the entire time. As soon as you want to stop having sex, you have the right to stop it.

, Having sex can be one of the most incredible—and one of the most awkward—experiences of your life. Though you shouldn’t expect it to be awful, you should set realistic expectations for yourself and your partner, especially if you’re never had sex before. If you’re ready to have sex with your partner, then you’ll eventually be able to find a pace and style that works for you, so you shouldn’t put too much pressure on that first time being magical or you’ll be disappointed.


Instead, look at it as an opportunity to take your physical experiences with your partner to a new level. Be realistic about what will happen and you may even be pleasantly surprised.

Retrace how your emotions developed.,
Make a list of pros and cons.,

Analyze your future plans.,
Consider whether this person has changed you.,
Notice how mundane things affect you.,
Think about the “green-eyed monster.” Notice how you feel when your crush talks to your potential rivals.",How to Know if You Love Someone1," Think back to when you first met your crush. Try to recall if you still feel the same or if your feelings have grown since then. What’s commonly called “love at first sight” is actually infatuation because it’s a sudden physical attraction. Love, on the other hand, increases over time from mere attraction to something deeper., Think about what you like and don’t like about your crush. Seeing your reasons on paper might help you to better assess your feelings.Noting their drawbacks will toss a little cold water on your passions and let you think a little clearer about what it is that you do like. Make each side as long as you can. Don’t worry about how major or trivial each pro or con is. Write down everything that comes to mind. You could include:


Pros: good-looking, kind, someone I can talk to
Cons: disorganized, immature at times, can be needy

, Analyze your pros and cons in terms of whether you’re looking at reality or an idealized image of your crush. Circle or highlight which pros intensify your feelings and which cons don’t affect how you feel. Evaluate whether those reasons are trivial or significant. If you can’t accept the whole person—flaws and all—you’re not in love.For example, you might be in love if you overlook their messiness because you’re too busy appreciating their generosity or engaging conversations.
On the other hand, you might not be in love if the sight of them makes feel warm and fuzzy, but you can’t imagine a future with them.

, Pay attention to whether you share their happiness or sadness when they tell you good or bad news. For example, if you start to tear up when your crush tearfully tells you their grandmother died, you’re feeling their pain. This is a good sign that you’re in love., Ask yourself whether you mean it when you say, “I miss you.” Take note of whether there are times when you can’t wait to get away from them. If you truly want them to be around all or most of the time, it’s probably love. If you find yourself eagerly planning your “me” time when you’re together, it’s just infatuation., Imagine your life in five or ten years. Consider the impact of career changes, children, and relocations. Consider whether you’re willing to face minor and life-threatening illnesses with this person. Think about taking care of them—or them taking care of you—as you grow old. If you can imagine a long-term future with this person, it’s probably love., This doesn’t mean you’ve done a complete 180 on your personality. Rather, reflect on whether you’ve expanded your horizons as a result of your crush. For example, maybe you never considered spending your weekend planting trees before your crush asked you to join them on a reforesting project. Now that you’ve done it, you feel this newfound connection with nature, and you owe it all to them. If you feel like this person has changed you for the better, it could be love., Take a mental note of how you feel the next time you and your crush do unexciting, everyday things together. For example, you normally hate grocery shopping but suddenly look forward to it because they’re going to be with you. This is a sign that you could be in love. On the other hand, if you’re still bored to tears and can’t wait to do something fun, it’s probably just infatuation., Make a note of how you feel when those potential rivals flirt with your crush. You should also consider whether you suspect your crush might lose interest in you as a result of the flirtation. Periodic jealousy is actually a healthy reaction that can make you want to hang on to someone a bit tighter. In fact, you could be in love if you feel it.On the other hand, if you’re suspicious and feel the urge to spy on your crush, it’s not love. At least it’s not healthy love. It’s likely gone beyond infatuation into 'obsession'."

Consider your larger social circle.",How to Know if You Love Someone2," When you’re with other people, split up and mingle. Try your best to stay engaged in the conversation. If you find yourself zoning out and looking around for your crush, the potential for love is there. If you catch them stealing a glance at you, the feeling might be mutual.

, Consider involuntary responses when you’re around your crush. Look out for rapid heart rate, hot flashes, shaky hands, and sweaty palms. Notice whether you suddenly clam up out of fear of what to say. Reactions like these signal lust and infatuation, not love., Consider how often you share your possessions with this person (or how prepared you are to do so). Imagine they want to borrow that rare vinyl album you just bought at auction. If you share or are willing to share, it could be love., This doesn’t mean giving up your career plans or letting your crush take advantage of you. It does mean giving a little to brighten their day. Think about the last time this person was sick. If you canceled your weekend binge-watching to take care of them, you could be in love. On the other hand, if your first reaction was to complain, it’s infatuation at best., Love makes you feel comfortable. In relaxed situations, you’re likely to imitate the other person’s actions, even if you’re not aware of it. Make a mental note if you catch yourself taking a sip of coffee almost at the exact same time they do. It’s not a surefire sign of love, but it increases the likelihood., This is especially important when your crush succeeds at something you’ve failed at. For example, they were awarded the promotion you were vying for. If your first reaction is to throw a party, you’re likely in love. On the other hand, if you mumble a disappointed “That’s nice” and avoid them the rest of the day, it’s just infatuation., Think about the number of friends and family members you’ve introduced this person to (or want to introduce them to). Ask yourself how important it is that they like this person. If you’ve introduced them to your best friend(s) and closest family members, and if you really want them to like this person, you could be in love."

, In class, determine if you are trying to think of excuses to talk to her or reasons to text or call her. Do you go out of your way to 'casually' bump into her and start a conversation?

, Do you try to say something to her, but then stop or spend a long time trying to figure out what to post on her Facebook profile, or what kind of things you should say when you e-mail her? You want to impress her, and you don't want to creep her out or make her think that you're a loser, right? If you feel this way, you like her!

, When you see her with other guys, or when she mentions them, think about if you feel an intense surge of jealousy or do you feel so angry that you want to punch the other guy in the face. Or, do you feel sad or like she's let you down? If you're feeling any (or all) of these things, you probably like her. If you aren't feeling any of these things, it means that you like her, but as a friend.

, E.g. just like talking to her, to you go out of your way to be around her? Do you try to sit near her in class, or hang out with her at lunch? Also, when you're around her, do you feel excited? This is a very good sign.

, For example, you're really cool and relaxed when you're talking to a buddy, and then when you start talking to her, you get nervous. You might trip over your words, and your hands might start to sweat. Also, your conversations might be awkward. This usually happens if you like her.

Do you look forward to your time together and miss each other when you’re apart? Do you catch him looking at you even when you’re not trying? Do you find yourself staring at him? And chemistry is not just physical attraction:


It’s the way he moves—the way he carries himself, his mannerisms, the goofy way he dances when he thinks no one’s watching.
It’s the way he interacts with other people—the way he jokes with his friends, the way he plays with your dog, the way he takes his niece out for ice cream.
It’s the sound of his voice—the way he laughs and the little catch-phrases he uses all the time. ;
, When you're with your soul mate, you just click. You don’t have to tell him that you’re tired and want to stay in for the night—he can see it on your face. And you can tell when he’s tired too. How in tune are you with with each other’s body language and moods? This natural harmony makes being together feel “right.” Remember that understanding each other's moods and needs doesn’t mean that you always feel the same way about everything. It just means that you have a deep empathy for each other and place a high value on each other's feelings.

, How complementary are your desires? Do you have similar libidos? If you're with your soul mate, he should know what you like and you should know what he likes, and you should enjoy doing those things together. Don’t assume that you will naturally come together sexually—many people are nervous trying new things in the bedroom. Communicate your desires to each other. If you're not satisfied, let him know what you want him to do. You’ll never know if you’re really compatible if you’re not open with each other. Don't worry if sex isn’t a priority in your relationship, as long as it’s not a priority for either of you, and as long as when it does happen, you both feel fulfilled. "

Ask yourself how well you know each other.",How to Know if He Is Your Soulmate2," Soul mates are a team. When you're with your soul mate, he’s got your back and you’ve got his. You know that when times get tough, you’ll face them together. Do you tell each other your problems? Does he listen when you’re upset and let you know that he’s there to help if you need it? Do you do the same for him?
When you need help does he do everything he can to help you? If you're with your soul mate, he’s not off with his friends while you build that new bookshelf alone. He’s right there next to you with a hammer. , When you're with your soul mate, you feel comfortable telling him things you wouldn’t tell other people, and he does so with you. You've seen each other’s vulnerable sides, and you’ve seen each other’s worst moments. You don’t worry that he’ll leave if he sees the real you, because he’s seen it—and he loves it. And you love him, too, flaws and all.


Do you feel comfortable telling him the things you’re ashamed or embarrassed of? Does he listen to you without judging? Does he open up to you? If you're soul mates, opening up should be easy because you're secure that you love and support each other, no matter what. , If you're with your soul mate, you should have plenty of similar interests. You don’t have to share every interest, but you should share at least some big ones. If you’re a major bookworm, your soul mate will probably enjoy reading, too. If you’re a nature-lover, your soul mate probably doesn’t hate being outside.


Don’t expect your soul mate to love everything that you do, or vice versa. You're both unique individuals, and that's part of why you love each other. But you should share at least a few major interests, and be willing to appreciate the rest. , Soul mates have a lot in common and support and listen to each other—but that doesn’t mean that they shy away from disagreements. If you're with your soul mate, you know that your love is stronger than any conflicts that arise between you. You both should feel comfortable facing your problems head on because you know that it makes your relationship stronger and helps you to be better people. Are you comfortable telling him when you think he’s wrong? Is he comfortable telling you? And when he calls you out, you should listen because you know that above all else, he supports you and wants you to be your best self. How do you argue? Soul mates don’t insult one another or hold onto ammunition from a fight they had six months ago. When you argue with your soul mate, it's with the goal of working out your problems and strengthening your relationship. The goal is never just winning the argument.

, Does he think you are interesting and exciting? Does he think your jokes are funny? Does he appreciate your intelligence? If you're with your soul mate, he should believe in you and encourage you to believe in yourself, and you should do the same for him.


This doesn’t mean you aren’t aware of each other’s flaws. But you should be able to accept those flaws as being part of what makes your partner who he is. , If you're soul mates you know more than just the big things; you also know the small details of each others’ daily lives, because you pay attention to each other and make each other a priority.

Your visions don’t have to be exactly the same, but if he’s picturing a quiet life on a farm in the country and you’re imagining life in a penthouse on Central Park, there might be trouble ahead. Having similar goals helps you to be a team and work together to achieve those goals.


Do you feel the same way about having kids (or not having kids)?
Do you feel the same way about home ownership? What kind of home, where, and when do you want to own--if at all?
Do you have complementary career goals? If you want to focus on your career and he wants to focus on raising a family, have you discussed how you can make those goals work for both of you?

, It’s not very romantic, but money problems are a common cause of breakups. If you feel better with a big chunk of change in your savings account and he wants to spend every penny he makes, you’re probably going to have some big problems.


Formulate a financial plan that you can both be happy with, and stick to that plan.
Always discuss any problems you’re having with money. Nobody likes financial surprises—not even your soul mate., Are your religious and political beliefs are complementary? You don’t have to be in complete agreement on these issues, but you shouldn’t be in complete disagreement. Do you place a similar value on religion? The more important religion is to you, the more important it becomes that you have similar religious beliefs. If you’re devout and he’s an atheist, there’s going to be trouble. But if you’re both casual believers, it doesn’t matter so much if, for example, you’re Jewish and he’s Muslim.
Do you place similar value on politics? If you’re both casual observers of politics, then disagreements won’t harm your relationship much. But if one of you is a staunch Democrat and the other is a staunch Republican, you’re going to find yourselves having big arguments. This doesn’t mean that you can’t work it out, but you’re going to have to find a way to talk about politics respectfully and listen to one another’s opinions, even if you vehemently disagree—which can be a tall order.

, Do you live your lives at complementary paces and enjoy spending time in similar environments? If you’re a couch potato and who doesn’t mind a mess, it’s probably going to be difficult to live with a guy who’s a neat freak and hates to sit still. On the other hand, two couch potatoes together can be a disaster—as can two ultra-excitable go-getters. Your lifestyles should complement each other, each pushing the other to do a little better and to relax a little more. If you’re not naturally attuned to the same lifestyle, don’t fret! You can work together to find a routine that makes you both comfortable. "

Look for someone who is kind.,
Look for someone who works hard.,
Expect a girl with good values and priorities.,
Look for a girl who creates an environment of trust, free of judgement.",How to Know if a Girl is the One for You1," One of the most important things when looking for the girl for you is making sure that your girl is kind. A sassy attitude is one thing but someone who does not care about the feelings of others won't be able to sustain a healthy relationship for very long.


Also kind to others. It's important that she's not just kind to you. She should also be kind to others, especially people that she doesn't have to be nice to (like service workers). It's easy enough for someone to fake being nice when they think that it's important, but being rude to people they don't care about should tip you off that you're one fight away from her being rude to you too.
This also means that she should be fair. Fairness is very important in relationships. Does she offer to pay for things every now and again? Does she split chores and relationship responsibilities evenly? This shows that she thinks about your well being, which is key in a relationship.;
, You want to be with someone who's willing to work for what they want in life. They should push themselves, at least occasionally. When someone works hard, that means that they will be stable and that there will be fewer chances for things to go wrong.


For example, if she wants to buy a purse, she should be selling some of her old stuff. She should not just expect you or her parents to just buy it for her. Birthdays and gift holidays are obvious exceptions, however.

, Having a girl with good values and priorities is very important in relationships. Her values and priorities don't have to match up with what's traditionally considered good but they should match up with your value system and your priorities. There are occasional exceptions though. Your girl should definitely:


Be honest. Honesty is incredibly important in relationships, no matter what kind of people you are and what kind of relationship you have. Relationships require trust and if she isn't honest with you, then you can only expect problems in the future.Accept people for who they are, including you. If your girl is judgmental of others, it could only be a matter of time before she's judging you too. If she is judgmental of you or constantly seeks to change who you are or what you look like, you deserve better and she is probably not the one for you., When you're around her, you should feel like you're in a place where you can be honest. You should feel like you can be yourself around her. You should feel like you can cry, be really dorky, and should make you feel like you can do all of the things that you don't normally do in front of other people.


For example, if you tell her something deeply personal (like you think you're depressed or that you want to be an astronaut), her response should not be to laugh at you or shut you down. She should try to help you, or at least not discourage you, even if she doesn't agree.

Stroke your partner's neck with your fingers.,
Kiss your partner on a sensitive part of her neck.",How to Kiss Your Partner's Neck1," Lightly stroke your partner's neck with the tips of your fingers. This will begin to turn on your partner and may even make her shiver with pleasure. Stroke the area that you plan to kiss and your partner will feel even more pleasure when you kiss her there.;
, One of the most sensitive parts of the neck is the where the neck connects with the shoulder and collarbone. Another sensitive part of the neck is the front left or right side. But almost any part of the neck is sensitive and susceptible to your kisses.


Use your body as you kiss your partner's neck. Don't just stand apart from your partner and lean in to kiss her neck. Instead, wrap your arms around her if you're facing her, or wrap your arms around her from behind if you're kissing her from behind.

Spend time together and apart.",How to Know if You've Found the One," Ask yourself if you're happy with your relationship as it is or if you find yourself thinking, “Things would be perfect if...” If you need things to change in your relationship before you can be happy with it, that relationship might be the wrong one.All relationships come with their own set of difficulties. Even when one problem is solved, another one will come along to replace it sooner or later.
Finding ""the one"" doesn't mean finding a relationship without problems. Instead, it means finding a relationship you feel completely happy with even in spite of the problems.;
, Allow your partner see who you really are instead of playing along with a false façade. You need to be able to trust that your partner will accept the real you if you want the relationship to last.


Part of this requirement depends on your partner, as well. You should be with someone who loves the real you and never demands that you change for his or her own sake.
Similarly, you also need to love your partner for who he or she really is.

, A good sign that you've found “the one” is when you prioritize your partner's happiness even above your own. Everything has its limits, but in general, you should be able to spend time and energy on securing his or her happiness without kicking up a fuss about doing so.


Aside from simply wanting to make your partner happy, you should already have some idea of how to do it. Think about little things, like the foods and activities that can cheer your significant other up after a long day. Also think about big things, like being able to get your partner to open up about worries and dreams.
Like most things, your partner should be able to demonstrate the same interest in your happiness as you have for his or hers.

, Consider whether or not any of your priorities have shifted since you began your relationship. Selfish pursuits should seem less important than matters that affect your relationship.For example, consider your views on monogamy. If you previously had no interest in getting married and settling down but now hope to do so with your current partner, that partner must be special enough or important enough for you to have altered those beliefs so naturally.

, It's a good sign when you care enough about your partner to put a little extra effort into your appearance, yet still feel comfortable allowing him or her to see you with sweatpants and dirty hair.


Appearances have more to do with attraction than love, but when you really love your partner, you will naturally want to appear desirable in his or her eyes.

, Everyone argues with those they feel close to. The strongest relationships involve partners who argue, but do so with resolution in mind. If you don't argue at all, it's a bad sign. If even the simplest arguments turn into week-long drama-fests, it's also a bad sign.


When couples don't fight, it usually means that one or both people are not being entirely honest. When needs, desires, and difficulties are not voiced, they are not addressed, and the relationship remains weakened.
Healthy arguments are free of violence in all its forms: verbal and physical. The fights are fair, and no one tries to manipulate the other party.

, The two of you should be able to laugh with each other and at each other. There should be room for seriousness in a serious relationship, of course, but you also need to balance that out with a healthy dose of humor.


The teasing that goes on between you two should be gentle and playful, though. If one person routinely breaks into tears, you're doing something wrong.

, If the two of you need constant chatter and excitement to make your relationship work, it could be a sign that your relationship won't work, or it may just mean that your relationship is still too new to predict the future.


Enjoying the mundane means wanting to learn the little details about your partner's past and present life.
Enjoying the ordinary also means feeling content to sit in and spend a quiet evening together. It's natural to crave excitement from time to time, but you need to be able to enjoy your partner's presence during the dull times, as well.

, The two of you should connect in little ways and big ways. Look for shared interests and similar quirks. Also ask yourself if the two of you share similar priorities and goals.


If the two of you have different goals, your lives will naturally move in different directions. For example, if you want to settle down, marry, and have children, but your partner wants to explore the world and has no interest in raising kids, the things you want out of life may simply be too different to make things work.
Hobbies and everyday interests are less important than goals, but still worth paying attention to. Having one or two shared interests will make it easier for you to spend time together. The more unusual or obscure those interests are, the better.

, A strong relationship is built around respect and commitment. You need to be able to respect your partner, but you also need a partner who will respect you in equal amounts.


Respect leads to everything else a healthy relationship requires: commitment, trust, communication, and general satisfaction. Without respect, none of these other qualities can take root.

, Think about past conversations the two of you had concerning the future. When the topic comes up, both of you should feel comfortable discussing it, and both of you should be able to picture the other as a part of your own future.


Your talks about the future don't always need to be serious. If it's still early in your relationship, you might casually of the things you should do together ""next month"" or ""next year."" As your commitment grows, however, the two of you should be able to talk about your long-term future and the rest of your lives.

, Your significant other should be the one person you want to share everything with. “Everything” means just about everything—exciting news, fears, that great new coffee shop you found, and so on.


Ask yourself how often you stumble upon interesting things you want to share with your partner later on. The more often this happens, the more deeply rooted that person is in your mind. A deep connection signifies a deeper level of commitment.
More significantly, honesty needs to feel natural for both of you. If you find yourself keeping secrets or know that your partner routinely hides information from you, that's a bad sign., While a committed relationship definitely runs deeper than mere physical attraction, good chemistry is also important. Fireworks do not need to go off every time your eyes meet, but there should at least be an occasional spark.


Physical intimacy and emotional intimacy are closely related. You need both to balance out a romantic relationship.

, Both of you should have a greater interest in working through things together than working through them separately. You may need to put the welfare of the relationship above your own individual desires from time to time, and you both should be okay with doing so when the situation really calls for it.


The first ""we"" thoughts are usually positive. The mind shifts from ""what am I doing this weekend?"" to ""what are we doing this weekend?""
Eventually, though, your ""we"" thoughts need to shift to more serious matters. For instance, if you're offered a new job in a different location, you should be just as interested in how it will affect your future as a couple instead of only thinking of how it will affect your future as an individual., Ask yourself how much time you spend being together and how much time the two of you spend talking about how things or and how they should be. Being able to live in the “now” is important if you want to stay together in the future.


Of course, you need to be able to address issues and desires as they come up. If these problems preoccupy you too often, though, it's a signal that things don't flow naturally between the two of you.

, Ask your friends and family what they think about your relationship. Mind you, not everyone will see things clearly. As a whole, though, the people closest to you should be able to approve of your relationship. They have a more objective perspective than either you or your partner, so to some degree, they can see things for what they really are.


If someone you trust is urging you to get out of a relationship, you might want to take those pleas seriously.
On the other hand, you also need to consider the source of the complaints. Someone who loves drama or is otherwise possessive of you may not make the greatest judge. Someone who wants you to be happy and has never caused problems for the sake of causing problems can usually be trusted, though.

, You don't need to love all of your partner's friends or family members, nor do you need to spend time hanging out with his or her buddies. The people one chooses to be around is a reflection on the person as an individual, though. If you absolutely cannot tolerate the vast majority of your partner's social circle, you may need to reexamine your partner and figure out what those friends say about him or her.


For example, if you think that all of your partner's friends are troublemakers, you might want to ask yourself if your partner is really the little angel he or she seems to be in front of you.

, Both of you should want to spend as much time together as possible without completely falling apart when the other isn't there.


Spend a few days or weeks apart and gauge how it feels. If you're completely unable to function, that might be a bad sign. If you can function but eagerly await the day when you two can meet again, that's generally a good sign.
You should be able to have separate friends and interests, but if you feel happier pursuing these things than you feel when you're with your partner, your relationship is off to a bad start.

Listen for laughter.,
Catch their eyes on you.,
See when someone is listening.,
Notice when someone touches you.,
Gauge when someone makes an effort to be near you.,
Pick up on ""mirroring.",How to Know if Someone Is Attracted to You1," People—especially women—tend to laugh more when they are attracted to someone.This doesn't mean that your crush wants to jump your bones just because she laughed at your joke – but you might notice when it's happening a lot.;
, Make a point of looking over at this person at spontaneous moments. If you catch him/her often staring at you, or even simply stealing glances – there is a good chance that he/she is interested. Both men and women tend to stare intensely for 2-3 seconds at people to whom they're attracted, then lower their eyes and quickly look away.This person may be trying to subtly flirt with you: looking over frequently in the hopes of catching your eye. Two can play at this game!
If your eyes meet, you can react in two ways: look away quickly, to play the coy role, or smile warmly to acknowledge the person.

, If someone cocks his or her head to the side, it usually means that he/she is interested in what you have to say. Note that this does not necessarily mean that the person is attracted to you. Attention and attraction do, however, often come hand in hand – and if a person is already listening, you might have a better chance of wooing them with your words.

, Subtle (or not-so-subtle) physical contact is a classic way of showing attraction.See if he/she seems to find excuses to brush your hand or your shoulder, or even just to get close to you. Perhaps he likes to jokingly tickle you; perhaps she hugs you for just a little bit longer than her other friends. If someone seems to be touching you a lot, there's a good chance that he/she is attracted to you.Try touching back. If you like the way that it feels—if it feels electric, real, and right—don't be afraid to reciprocate. This can be a great way to signal that you are attracted, too., Even if the person isn't actually touching you, you might notice him/her trying to spend time with you. Perhaps he volunteers to work an event with you, or to be your lab partner; perhaps she shows up at every show that your band plays; perhaps he messages you online just to ask ""what's up?"" If someone is actively trying to place him/herself within the sphere of your awareness, there's a good chance that it's because he/she is attracted to you.

,""We tend to imitate or ""mirror"" the poses and expressions of people to whom we're attracted. This can take the form of someone subconsciously shifting her legs to sit how you are sitting; slowing her walking speed to match your pace; smiling when you smile, or looking where you look. Most people aren't aware of this impulse when they're acting on it – but you might be able to use this knowledge to speculate on whether someone is attracted to you."

Pay attention to how she makes you feel.,
Want a girl who makes you a better person.,
Look for a girl who puts as much effort into the relationship as you do.,
Pay attention to how she shows her appreciation.,
Expect that she's willing to share responsibility.,
Consider finding someone who balances you out.,
Look for someone who fights fair.",How to Know if a Girl is the One for You2," How she makes you feel is an important factor in deciding if she's the one. You should feel better when you're with her, about yourself and about life. You should feel more confident and happy. You should miss her when she's gone. She should not make you feel weak or stupid. She shouldn't make you feel anxious or worried about saying or doing the wrong thing all the time. Being with her should feel natural and good.


Some people like to be with someone who makes them feel bad, angry, or excited in bad ways. That's okay for short term flings but it's usually a good sign that someone is not the ""one"" for you. Relationships like that rarely work in the long term and you're signing yourself up for too much trouble to consider the girl to be the one for you.

, When we're in relationships, we should be with someone who makes us better. If you're with someone who makes you a worse person, then what's the point, right? Think about whether this girl makes you better. If she does, that can be a huge sign that she's the one for you.Does she encourage you do improve yourself and your life? Does she find ways to help you achieve your goals? Does she make you want better things for your future? Does she make you want to work hard? These are all good things.

, When two people are in a relationship, they should both be willing to invest equally in making the relationship as good and fulfilling as possible. If she wants you to do everything and make all sorts of changes but isn't willing to doing anything herself, that's not a very good sign. But if she is willing to put as much effort in as you, then that's a sign that things can really work.


For example, she should occasionally plan dates for the two of you, instead of you always having to come up with everything.
This doesn't mean that she has to be super active in the relationship. If you're both relaxed in your approach to being together, that's fine too. The more important thing is that your attitudes and needs are the same.

, You don't want to be with someone who takes you for granted. Pay attention to if she thanks you or shows her gratitude in some way when you do something nice for her. You should also try to notice if she does nice things for you on occasion, just to show how much she cares about you.


Even if the things she does for you are small, that's okay. Not everyone has time or money to make big gestures. But doing small things, like making your favorite meal or writing you a love note, shows that she thinks about you and wants to show you how much you mean to her.

, If you two are older and have living situations of your own, like an apartment or house, you should notice if she's willing to split chores and finances evenly or at least fairly. This shows that she is fair, hard working, and honest. If she's not willing to contribute in her own way, then she will probably be too much of a burden in the long run.


Sometimes splitting things fairly might not mean splitting them evenly. For example, if you're sharing an apartment, you shouldn't split the rent down the middle. Instead, each person should only be contributing about 30% of their income, which is considered the financially responsible amount. That means if you make $4000 a month and she makes $1600 a month, you should be contributing $1200 and she should be contributing about $500.

, Having things in common is very important in a partner. You want to be with someone who's similar to you in certain ways. However, there is something to be said for being with someone who's different in certain ways too. This lets you contribute to the relationship equally simply by being yourselves.


For example, maybe you're organized but shy and she's spacey but outgoing. She can help you learn to be more social and you can help her keep her life in order.

, Fights in relationships happen. This is normal and can be a sign of a healthy relationship. However, you want someone who fights with you in a fair way. She shouldn't insult you or go for the low blow: that is a serious sign of disrespect. She also shouldn't blackmail you into getting her way. Instead, you want to look for a girl who is willing to have a discussion until you can both come to a compromise.For example, she shouldn't bring up your father's drinking problem every time you fight about you staying out late. That is unfair to you and has little impact on the problem in your relationship.

Look for a girl who shares your interests.,
Want someone who shares your value and priorities.,
Look for a girl that has similar goals.,
Find a girl who understands your friends and has good friends herself.,
Consider a girl who has a similar background or experiences.",How to Know if a Girl is the One for You3," You want someone with whom you can do activities, so you'll easily be able to spend time together. You want someone who you can have a conversation with. Choosing a girl with similar interests is crucial in making sure that neither of these things are a problem in the future.


You start your relationship with things in common or you can build common interests over time. Try taking up new hobbies together in order to build new interests. One good example of a hobby to try as a couple is learning a language.You can find free language classes online or you can take a course at your local community center or school.

, The person who you choose to be with should share your values and priorities. This is one of the defining features of someone who is right for you.They don't need to be the ""normal"" values or priorities, but they should be the same as yours. This will prevent tension and conflict as you go through a relationship.


For example, if she's a hardcore conservative and you're very liberal, you're going to encounter a lot of philosophical differences that can, over time, make you respect each other less.
However, if you can find common ground even between different values and priorities, you can sometimes make it work. You see this, for example, in couples with different religions. One might be Jewish and one might be Christian, but they're both devout in their love to God and that is enough for them. Sometimes the fundamental belief is more important than the details.

, You should have similar goals in life, if you plan on making this a very long-term relationship. It's okay for specific goals to change over time but the broad strokes should match up. This is because your goals will put you on a particular path in life, just like hers will determine her path. If your paths diverge, the relationship will be very difficult or even impossible.


For example, it's okay if she doesn't plan on pursuing higher education if that is something that is also unimportant to you. However, if education and ambition are things that are important to you, you will find your relationship filled with challenges.

, The two of you won't be the only players in this relationship. The relationships that you have with other people often play a major role in making a romantic relationship work. You want a girl who can interact with and respect your friends. Similarly, her friends should be people that you can coexist with.For example, if her friends are really catty and always try to get her to spend less time with you, you should expect that there will be a very bumpy road ahead of you.
You'll have to determine what you want to do about this kind of problem. If these problems weigh too heavily on your relationship and she isn't willing to work on the problem, you might need to consider someone else. Certainly, you should talk to her about it and see what kind of solution the two of you can create though.

, Now, this isn't a requirement to a happy relationship, but it can certainly be a major added bonus. People that grew up in similar environments or have done similar sorts of things in their life tend to understand each other better, think in similar ways, and have more to bond over. If your girl's life looks much like your own, it can make certain things easier in your relationship.


For example, maybe you both grew up with difficult siblings or family members. While someone who didn't might have a hard time understanding why you don't want to go home for the holidays, someone who did might be perfectly happy to make your holiday happier by keeping it just the two of you.

Wet your lips for a closed-mouth kiss.,
Kiss your partner's neck with an opened mouth.,
Slow down.,
Suck gently on your partner's neck.,
Gently bite your partner's neck.",How to Kiss Your Partner's Neck2," First, wet your lips with your tongue just enough so that they're soft. Then, gently kiss any part of your partner's neck with a closed mouth, as if you were giving your partner a close-mouthed kiss on the lips. You can start by kissing the area where your partner's neck meets her shoulders or collarbone, resting your lips on the curved groove.

, Slowly open your mouth in between kisses, and begin to kiss your partner's neck with an open mouth, separating your lips as you gently kiss her skin. You can also move up and down your partner's neck to add some variety.


Breathe some hot air on your partner's neck in between kisses. This will drive your partner crazy with pleasure.
If you're really getting into it, lick your partner's neck from the bottom to the top. Use only the tip of your tongue and be very gentle. Make sure your partner is enjoying this sensation.
Do not do this if it's your first time kissing this person. Confirm it with them first if you're interested, but only do this if you've kissed their neck before or you have some experience with it. This goes for blowing air or using your tongue, and especially for biting and sucking. If it's your very first time, just stick with open and closed mouth kisses. Do this so that you and your partner can discuss anything else that the two of you would be interested in doing.

, Give your partner slow wet kisses so she can really feel the sensations. You can focus on kissing one area of the neck or move all around her neck. Try kissing near her ear -- this is another sensitive area. Blowing hot air near the ear will drive your partner wild as well.

, Gently suck on your partner's neck for just one or two seconds at a time. Just don't do it too quickly or you'll leave a hickey, and your partner may not be into that. You can suck on your partner's neck in between close-mouthed or open-mouthed kisses.

Be very careful of hickeys. Sucking and biting is very likely to result in a hickey, and that may get both of you in some very serious trouble.






You can also blow some cool air onto the spot that you sucked when you release your mouth.

, After you've been kissing your partner's neck for a while, try gently biting her skin. If you're careful, you can bite a little bit of skin in between your teeth and gently lift it before lowering it. Remember to take it easy with this one -- at first, you may catch your partner by surprise.

Watch how this person acts with other people.,
Sense attention.,
Put the clues together.",How to Know if Someone Is Attracted to You2," Your crush may make a point of touching your shoulder a lot, or of giving you big hugs. He/she may also touch a lot of other people in this way. Some people are simply more outwardly affectionate than others, and it can be hard to tell when these people are genuinely attracted to someone. Be careful how much you read into the actions of a very flirtatious person.


Be aware that he/she is not only attracted to you. Even if this person has a crush on you, there's a good chance that he/she encounters other attractive people. Don't be discouraged just because there's a bit of competition!
Eventually, you might be able to distinguish this person's ""attraction"" behavior from the way that he/she acts around platonic friends. It may not be what you expect. Some people even clam up and get uncharacteristically shy around those whom they like!

, If someone is attracted to you, you should feel the general warmth of this person's attention on you. Perhaps he/she talks about sensual things or sensitive things; perhaps he/she is always asking you how you're doing. It can be a hard thing to intellectualize – sometimes, you may find that you can feel a palpable energy between yourself and another person.

, This is no exact science, and attraction usually won't be clear from just one behavior. Use your best judgment. If you caught someone staring at you from across the room, once, then that could mean almost anything. However, if you interact with this person often, and he/she laughs at your jokes, mirrors your gestures, makes a point to touch you and be near you – you might begin to reasonably assume that he/she is attracted to you.


Ask a friend, if you aren't sure. If a friend of yours has seen the two of you together, he/she might be able to give an outsider's perspective on whether the person is attracted to you. Make sure not to ask a mutual friend that might spill the beans!"
"
Test the waters.,
Be confident.,
Talk to this person.,
Understand the limits of attraction.",How to Know if Someone Is Attracted to You3," If you think that someone likes you, try to find out more. Put your arm around her during a movie to see how she reacts; give him an extra-long hug and try to gauge his interest; smile slyly back when you catch him staring. Be bold and flirtatious, and you might be able to bring a bit more clarity to the situation.

, If you're pretty sure that this person is attracted to you, then there's a good chance that he/she likes you at least a little bit. It is natural to want to be sure – but at some point, you'll need to make a move. This can take many forms: asking someone out, hooking up with someone, or just telling someone how you feel.Do not be forceful, and try not to make too many assumptions. Be respectful, always.

, Ultimately, direct communication is the surest way to know that someone is attracted to you. If you think that there's a mutual attraction, try to get this person alone for a conversation. Lead in slowly, if you like, or come out and confess your feelings. Kiss the person, if the moment feels right. Talk about your feelings and and establish a mutual understanding.

, Someone may well be attracted to you, but that does not necessarily mean that he or she wants to begin a physical or emotional relationship with you. Attraction is a primal sensation. We cannot necessarily control when and whether we feel it – but we can choose where we direct it and how we respond to it. Think carefully about the consequences of acting on mutual attraction.If this person is already in a relationship with someone else, he or she may have committed to monogamy. Consider whether it is your place to disturb that agreement.
The person in question might not be looking for any sort of relationship, period. Know that your attitude toward attraction is not necessarily the same as everyone else's attitude toward attraction.

Look for positive signs.,
Make sure you're in good company.,
Practice good hygiene.",How to Kiss a Girl's Neck1," The best kisses are the ones where both people are enjoying it. Observe your girlfriend before you attempt a kiss on the neck. You'll want to take cues from her on whether or not it is the right time to go in for a kiss. Typically, her body language and facial expressions will give you important signs.Pay attention when you touch her. Whether your hands brush when you hand her a drink, or there is contact when you help her put on her coat, notice her response when you make physical contact. If she pulls away at all, she is probably not receptive to kissing at this time. But if she allows the touch to linger, that is a positive indicator.
Notice her eye contact. Is she letting her gaze linger on yours? That is a sign that she might be open to kissing. If she looks away quickly, she is trying to create space between you.
Blushing is a good sign. If her cheeks are flushed when she looks at you, that is a sign that she is attracted to you. You can also look at her feet. If they're pointed towards you, she is receptive to your attention.Have good timing. Pay attention to your date's actions and words. For example, if she is telling you an emotional story about a fight she had with her best friend, this is probably not the right time to kiss her on the neck. That might be seen as not taking her problem seriously.;
, Before you go in for a kiss on the neck, make sure that you are in an appropriate environment. Many women are open to a little bit of physical affection in public, but most will shy away from overt displays of physical activity in public.Pay attention to her mood. Does she seem relaxed and comfortable? Then it might be a good environment for a kiss.Know the crowd. Is your girlfriend's family extremely conservative? Then it is probably not a good idea to give her a lingering kiss on the neck in front of them. Likewise, it is probably not appropriate if you are spending time with her boss or coworkers.
If you are in a relaxed public space, such as a sporting event or concert, a kiss on the neck might be a fine idea. However, make sure that you are not putting your date on display by drawing a lot of attention to the two of you.

, Women say that physical chemistry is very important when choosing who they want to kiss. Females are attracted to how people look and how they smell. Most woman report that prefer being kissed by someone who is well-groomed. If you have facial hair, make sure that it is clean, trimmed, and looking good.Having fresh breath is also important. If you anticipate kissing, take a moment before hand to pop a breath mint. This will make kissing a more pleasurable experience for both of you.

End on a good note.",How to Kiss a Girl During the Movies for Middle School Guys," Though many people share their first kiss in middle school, many people are also not ready to kiss when they're at this young age. If you're still in middle school, you have to make sure that you're ready and that the girl you're with is also ready to kiss you. If you've started dating and she's hinted that she wants to kiss you or has responded well to your affection, then you're on the right track, but you should try to be as sure as you can before you make a move.


Ideally, you should have kissed your girl before the movies to make your movie kiss less awkward. It can be kind of hard to kiss someone for the first time in the dark.;
, You should pick a movie that is suitable for kissing. Pick a romantic movie or something lighthearted, so she wouldn't feel weird about kissing you in the middle of the movie. Just make sure you don't pick something that she's been dying to see or she'll be too interested in the movie to take a kissing break. You should also try to pick a movie that won't be too crowded; pick something that's been out for at least a month, so the theatre won't be packed. If you're surrounded by families or other kids, it'll be harder to make a move.


Let the girl pick the movie to make her feel special. Ask her if there's something she's really wanted to see. But if she says she really doesn't care, then you can take charge.

, Shower before you go. Brush your teeth well. Use deodorant and dress nicely. You can also carry mints for later. You don't have to dress to the nines, but let the girl see that you've made an effort to go on a date with her. She'll appreciate that you made the effort and will be more likely to respond favorably. If you dress to see her like you dress for school, then she won't feel very special.

, Though you can get some popcorn or M&Ms if that's what you both really want, remember that this will make it a little harder to make a move. You'll be less likely to steal a kiss if your fingers are covered in nacho cheese or popcorn butter. If she wants popcorn, of course, then you should order it without being cagey, but if she says she doesn't care, then you can skip out on the treats and focus on the main attraction.

, Though the movie theatre is a public place, you should try to find somewhere to sit where you won't be surrounded by too many people. Though it's hard to get true privacy in the movies, you should do the best you can to sit away from large or noisy groups of people. Try to get a seat on one of the sides of the theatre, near the wall, so that you are less likely to disturb people if you try to steal a kiss.


Try not to be obvious about it. If your girl asks why you're so picky, just say that you like sitting on the sides of the theatre.

, Just be relaxed and confident. You don't have to do the corny thing where you pretend to yawn and then spread your arm over her shoulder. Just be cool about it. You can be bold and drape your arm around the seat before she sits down, or ease into it after the movie starts. You don't want to assume too much and make the girl uncomfortable by making a move too soon. Feel her out. If she responds well to your touch and affection in general and you've put your arm around her before, then doing so at the movies won't be a big deal.


You can even ask her if she's cold; chances are that she will be, because movie theaters are always freezing. This gives you an excuse to put your arm around her.

, As the movie progresses, you should lean in closer to the girl. Do this slowly when the time is right, or during a scary or romantic scene in the movie. After you put your arm around her, move closer to her so that your heads are almost touching. You can stroke her upper arm with the arm that is draped around her, or you can put a hand on her knee. Just find a way to make her feel comfortable and closer to you.


This is where those concessions can become a bit of a pain. Make sure you don't accidentally knock over a drink or a box of Milk Duds. If she seems really into her snack, then you may want to wait a bit until she eats her food so she doesn't feel intruded upon when you try to get close to her.

, If she's constantly glancing at you or looking at your lips, then she probably wants to kiss you. If she seems a little nervous but responds well to your touch, then she may also want to kiss you. If she keeps pulling away when you try to get close, then she may not be ready for kissing. Remember that you're only in middle school, and many girls have not kissed and are not comfortable with doing so at that age. Ease off on the pressure or she'll feel uncomfortable.


If she turns to you to make little comments or just when she laughs, then it's another sign that she wants your faces to be closer together.

, When the time is right, go in for a kiss. You can make eye contact, touch her cheek, and then tilt her face toward yours and lean toward her until you lock lips. Your lips should touch each other firmly, but not too firmly. You can kiss her for just a second or two before you pull away. Most middle school girls are not ready for French kissing, so you shouldn't use your tongue unless you are very, very sure that the girl is ready for this, or you both will be in for an unpleasant surprise. After a few seconds, you can try to kiss her again, or sit back and enjoy the movie until you have another opportunity to give her a kiss.


Even after you pull away, remain affectionate. Keep an arm around her shoulder or on her knee so she still feels like you're paying attention to her.

, When the movie is over, squeeze her hand and let her know you had a great time and that you can't wait to see her again. Make sure the girl knows that you like her company more than you like kissing her. Though you're at an age where kissing is one of the most new and exciting things you can do, so is getting to know a girl you really like. If you kiss her just enough without coming on too strong, you'll be buying your movie tickets again before you know it.

, Instead of delivering a series of multiple, quick kisses, try one longer movement. Begin your kiss at the top (or bottom) of her neck. Without breaking contacts between your lips and her neck, slide your mouth up and down her neck.Since this kiss is more prolonged than others, it is probably best to try this method when you two are alone in a private place.
Try wrapping your arms around her waist or resting them on her shoulders. Do whatever feels natural for you. If it's a longer kiss, you'll probably want to draw her close to you and hold her in your arms.

, Kisses convey a lot of emotion. The way you kiss her neck can say something about your intentions. For example, a kiss can promote affection and bonding. A quick kiss on the neck can tell your girlfriend, ""Hi, I'm glad to be here with you.""Kissing can also convey that you are attempting to arouse and seduce your girlfriend. If this is your intention, up the intensity of your kisses. Let them linger a little longer, and make them a bit more persistent.

Become comfortable displaying your affection gradually.,
Engage in activities that encourage physical closeness.,
Cherish cuddling.,
Hold hands as a sign of affection.,
Kiss as a display of passion, but don't take individual kisses too seriously.,
Be playful!,
Stay happy and healthy.",How to Improve Physical Intimacy1," If you're not experienced performing physical acts of affection with your sweetheart or significant other, don't dive into the deep end! Doing so is a sure-fire recipe for confusion and hurt feelings. Instead, take your time building up your sense of physical intimacy with your partner by starting with small (but meaningful) displays of affection and gradually proceeding to more serious forms of affection. Remember, the emotions involved with physical intimacy are very potent and very real, so be sure not to rush into intense forms of physical intimacy until you're comfortable with less-intense ones.;
, If you're not sure of how to begin your physical relationship with you partner, start small. Doing something that requires both of you to be physically close to each other is a perfect way to ease in to the habit of being physically affectionate with your partner and can even be a ""launching pad"" for other physical activities. Try snuggling up together for a movie, riding a roller coaster together, riding a motorcycle, swimming together, or jet ski, or anything else that requires two people to cozy up to each other. Even simply sitting so that the side of your leg is touching your partner is more affectionate than not doing so. Everyone has to start somewhere!

, When you're comfortable being in each others' personal bubbles, you and your partner will probably naturally begin to cuddle or snuggle. Lounging as you embrace your significant other is a great, highly underrated way to relax with your partner as you strengthen the physical bond between you.


Don't write off the time you spend cuddling with your partner - as your relationship grows more serious, you may begin to wish you had more time for it.

, Holding hands can sound childish and innocent to the experienced Lothario, but it's great as a simple show of affection, especially in situations where more overt displays may be inappropriate. For instance, this gesture is a socially-acceptable way to display affection in public, where actions like making out can be considered obnoxious. Holding hands is also something to do when other romantic gestures are impractical, like when you're stuffed into the back seat of a cramped car. While hand-holding may not be the most fiery, exciting form of physical intimacy, it is certainly the most versatile.

, This is it - the big moment! Kissing your significant other is a big step up from hand-holding and cuddling. It's a way of showing that you really care for and desire him or her, so your kisses should have feeling behind them. Ideally, the first time you kiss your significant other, you should be so filled with longing that's hard not to do it. Of course, it's pretty unrealistic to assume that every couple is going to have a perfect first kiss, or, in fact, perfect kisses most of the time, so don't put too much stock in any one kiss. Rather treat kisses as the fun, mutually enjoyable, but serious displays of affection that they are.

, The prospect of engaging in physical intimacy with your significant other shouldn't be intimidating - if it is, you may need to have a frank discussion with him about your intimacy issues. Physical intimacy should be an opportunity not only to display your affection for your partner, but also simply to have a good time with him or her, so consider keeping your shows of affection light and playful. ""Teasing"" your partner is a sure-fire way to lighten the mood - try playful tickling while you cuddle or withholding kisses during a makeout session. As long as teasing is done in good humor and with consideration for frustration or hurt feelings on your partner's part, it's a great way to infuse any act of physical intimacy with playful passion.

, It bears mentioning that your attitude isn't the only thing that affects your ability to have an emotionally intimate relationship with your partner. Your physical and emotional health also factor in to your sense of intimacy with your partner. For instance, good hygiene is a must. There's no way around it - no matter how romantic you are, if you stink, your physical intimacy will suffer. You'll also want to put effort into your physical fitness so that you'll look and feel your best when you're with your partner. On the emotional side of the intimacy equation, you'll want primarily to deal with significant sources of stress in your life as they arise, as stress can have a profound negative impact on your ability to enjoy physical intimacy sessions.


Exercise regularly. Research has proven that regular exercise literally makes you feel better by releasing chemicals called endorphins into the brain.These endorphins help produce a euphoric, satisfied sensation, ensuring that you're in the right mood for physical intimacy. As an added bonus, regular exercise can help you get more fit and attractive!
Don't be afraid to talk to others - including trained professionals - about any mental stresses you're dealing with in your life. In addition to friends, loved ones, and trusted authority figures like teachers and priests, counselors can help you talk through any issues that are causing you stress and/or interfering with your ability to have satisfying physical intimacy.

Spice things up by having sex at unexpected times, in unexpected ways, or in unexpected places. Further, don’t be afraid to masturbate; masturbation can be a healthy part of a relationship., If introducing toys and costumes into the bedroom seems exciting and fun for both of you, go for it. Be as kinky as you want to be. As long as your relationship puts honesty and communication first, there's no wrong way to have sex.Add to the fantasy with role-playing. You both could dress up in costumes and call each other by different names.
Blindfolds are easy ways to make sex suddenly touch-focused and different. If you're into it, go the sensory-deprivation route.
Some couples in long term relationships like to relive the early stages of their dating, when they couldn't get enough of one another. Plan to meet separately at a bar you used to frequent and pretend like you don't know each other. Go through all the motions of the first blind date, and pretend you don't know anything about the other's sexual likes. Go from there.

Rethink your attitudes towards sex.,
Make time for romance.,
Learn to massage.,
Be open and communicative about sex.,
Go to bed together.,
Spend plenty of time on foreplay.,
Never push for something that makes your partner feel uncomfortable.,
Don't put your limits to the test.,
Indulge your curiosities and fantasies.",How to Improve Physical Intimacy2," Physical intimacy in the form of sex is not a performance, a chore, or a competition. Rather, it's the sincerest possible expression of your love for someone else and a way to cement the bond between you and this other person. At the very least, it should be fun, relaxing, and fulfilling, not stressful! Don't think of sex as something that has to be done a certain way or otherwise it's not ""good"" - rather, think of sex as a chance for you and your partner to be yourselves. This attitude extends to the way you view your partner as well - s/he is a real person with his or her own unique sexual likes and dislikes.


For example, let's say that a straight couple is having intimacy problems because the man in the relationship is self-conscious about his ability as a lover. The man is operating with mistaken assumptions of masculine adequacy - basically, he thinks it's a man's job to be the ""active"", ""experienced"" partner. Ironically, this very worry is what keeps him from gaining the seasoned experience and confidence he needs to be the best lover he can be. If the man saw sex as more of a form of self-expression and less as an opportunity to perform a pre-determined role, he would probably enjoy it more.

, Sex is like any other skill or hobby - devoting time and effort to it can make it much, much better. You may want to try using ""traditional"" romantic gestures - for instance, lighting aromatic candles, sharing a glass or two of wine, and having a close, affectionate talk on the couch, basking in the intimacy of the moment. Or, you may want to try something a little more off-beat that fits the two of you as a couple. It's up to you. Remember that, whatever you choose to do, all the scene-setting will lead up to a rewarding and enjoyable shared moment of love.

, Massage is excellent as a show of affection, as a method of foreplay, and as a way to get close to your partner. You may want to use a neutral oil (like grapeseed oil), especially if you or your partner have allergies. If not, however, you have the option of using a scented lotion or oil, which some partners may prefer. Pleasant sensations and smells can both relax and arouse.


Touching and being touched are both equally important, so learn both to give and to receive! If you're too jittery to receive a massage without breaking into giggles, try relaxing beforehand with some light exercise or a dip in a hot tub.

, From time to time, talk to your partner in order to learn about their likes and dislikes. Many people can be shy about expressing deep-held desires in the heat of the moment, in which case, talking about sex outside of the act itself is crucial for ensuring both partners are being satisfied.


Getting in the habit of focusing on your partner's satisfaction is a great idea. If both partners have this giving attitude, sex can become an incredibly gratifying, bond-strengthening activity.

, This seems obvious, but with the demands of work (and childcare, if you have children), many couples don't have the opportunity to go to bed at the same time. Going to bed together isn't just a chance to have sex (though it's that too!), it's an opportunity to confide in your significant other, building the intimate bond between the two of you. Many of a couple's most honest, candid conversations happen in bed, as it's one part of the day where it's virtually guaranteed that no one else is around. Giving up this special time means giving up a great chance for physical and emotional intimacy.


If your schedule simply doesn't allow you to go to bed at the same time as your partner, try at least to spend some time in bed together - before your partner gets out of bed, for instance. Also, have some way for your partner to signal you that s/he is ""in the mood"" so that you can make sure to be in bed with him or her when it counts.

, Teasing, kissing, heavy petting, and other foreplay techniques can be incredible tools for increasing the satisfaction that both partners achieve from sex. This is also an excellent way to discover what each partner likes, as most people are more sexually open when they're ""in the mood"". Don't rush things - take your time so that you can truly enjoy each moment.

, Experimenting during sex can be a wonderful thing. It's a great way to expand your horizons as a couple. However, if it's done without regard for your partner's feelings, you can end up really hurting him or her. It's acceptable to introduce new ideas to your partner, but never, ever try to push your partner into something s/he is reluctant to take part in. Doing so can lead to deep regret and irreparable damage.

, Just as it's important not to be sexually demanding of your partner, it's important not to let him or her be demanding of you. Never, ever feel like you need to express your physical affection in ways that make you uncomfortable. Rushing into sexual situations that you're not ready for can leave you with confusing, painful emotional scars. If your partner asks you to do something sexual that you're not ready to do, don't force yourself to do it out of either a sense of obligation or a desire to make your partner happy. Good, respectful partners will be more than patient and understanding. Over time, as you gain confidence as a lover, you may eventually find that you're interested in trying new things that once intimidated you. Listen to your inner voice and never feel a need to compromise in this area.

, With patience, time, and respect, eventually, you'll grow more comfortable and confident as a lover. As your love grows as couple, you can start to share your more intimate fantasies (and maybe even act some of them out!) So long as it is fun, gratifying, and done in a way that maintains the love and respect both partners have for each other, there is no harm in experimentation.

Tell your partner what you like.,
Be specific.,
Be honest about changes in your body.,
Engage in mutually pleasurable activities.,
Share fantasies.,
Connect with your partner.",How to Improve Your Sex Life2," The safest, smartest, and quickest way to improve your sex life is to communicate openly with your partner. Tell your partner what turns you on and what turns you off. Discuss your limitations and your ambitions for your sex life. Tell your partner anything they need to know to make your sex life as pleasurable as possible.Don’t focus on what your partner is doing wrong, instead, focus on expressing your desires. Use “I” statements, such as “I like it when you touch me like this” or “I’d feel more comfortable waiting for that.”If you find it difficult or embarrassing to talk about sex with your partner, do simultaneous free-writes and share your writing with each other, or turn off the lights and talking in the dark.
Talking builds trust and intimacy. While it may seem hotter to cut to the chase, talking in the early stages of your relationship will help you avoid awkwardness and build the trust necessary to facilitate a healthy sex life.
Don't do anything you're not ready for. Talk about it first.

, When talking about sex, we often get sheepish and fall somewhat short of talking as specifically as would be helpful. Try to be as specific as possible so your partner doesn't have to work to decode your messages.Instead of saying, ""I wish we'd have more sex"" or ""I wish we'd have different sex,"" tell your partner how much you love being with them and how you want to work on building your intimacy with each other. Then discuss specific things you'd like to do together, or specific things you'd like to change.
Don’t fake anything. This damages trust and intimacy in the relationship. Instead, make your desires known and be honest of what is and isn’t working., Both men and women experience physical changes that can affect their sex lives.If menopause is changing your libido, say something. It’s better than your partner thinking you are uninterested.
If you are experiencing erectile dysfunction, talk with your partner and your doctor. The condition is often easily treated and is nothing to be embarrassed about., Maybe you shrug off having a higher sex drive than your partner, but perhaps you are not engaging in the most interesting sex for your partner. Discuss what each of you likes that the other partner does. Then, discuss things you’d like to introduce that may be new or different. The goal is to ensure the happiness of both partners in mutual pleasure.Approach this discussion with a non-judgmental attitude and do not be afraid of shame; feel safe discussing sexuality with your partner.

, Talk about the things you fantasize about, the things that turn you on. Write them down if you feel sheepish and then discuss them with your partner. If something comes up in conversation, like when you're watching television or reading a magazine, ask ""What do you think of that?"" Be honest and be open with your partner. Sharing fantasies can be refreshing in your sex life.The brain is your most sensitive sexual organ. Discussing fantasies doesn't necessarily mean you're going to act them out in real life, but in a trusting and open relationship, discussing fantasies of all sorts can be an open door to explore your sexual side and keep your sex life fresh, spontaneous, and fun.

, Before sexually connecting, try connecting in different ways. These ways may differ from couple to couple, so it’s important to connect in meaningful ways as a couple. Find the ways you meaningfully connect, then engage these interactions before sex. Intimacy can include intellectual, experiential, and emotional connection.You want to build a sense of intimacy and trust as a foundation.


Emotionally connect through heart-filled conversation, sharing your feelings and practicing empathy.
Intellectually connect by discussing a topic you both care about.
Connect physically with your partner by sitting across from each other and staring into each other’s eyes. It may feel silly or you might start to feel vulnerable, but keep with it and maintain this intimacy until you are ready to move forward.

Make time for sex.,
Take a vacation together.,
Create a beautiful space.,
Initiate sex with your partner.,
Practice emotional intimacy as well as physical intimacy.,
See a counselor.",How to Improve Your Sex Life3," You may think scheduling time for sex is not romantic, or that sex is better when it’s spontaneous, but give it a chance. If you are always ""too busy,"" this is one way to nail down your priorities.Plan one day each week that you commit to having sex with your partner. Throughout the day, build up the excitement and build the tension. Make it something you and your partner look forward to doing.

, Even a short weekend away can alleviate the burden of daily life. Sometimes work, school, or kids present too many distractions that interfere with your sex drive.Break away from routine by eliminating distractions and allow your focus to be on your partner and your relationship.


If need be, find a babysitter (or pet sitter) and take a mini-vacation. It can be as simple as camping in the woods or going to a little motel down the road.
Your budget won't allow for travel? Take a vacation at home by shutting off the computer and cell phones, turning off the TV, and making a point to connect with your partner.

, Light some candles, invest in some silky sheets, and make your bedroom a sanctuary for the two of you. Create positive associations in the bedroom and get rid of anything that doesn’t appear inviting: piles of laundry, work papers, or children’s toys., If you've been passive leading up to your intimate sessions, take the lead for a change. If you feel like you're always the one to initiate sex, talk to your partner about it and tell them that you don't want to feel like the sex hound in the relationship. Make sure everything is out on the table and that you're both satisfied with the way things progress., Your sex life is about more than what happens between the sheets. If you're not close emotionally, if you're not spending time together and understanding each other, the sex will suffer and so will your relationship.You have to talk and you have to spend time with each other, taking care of every aspect of your relationship.


Feel comfortable enough with your partner to share your hopes, fears, dreams, and desires. Experience vulnerability by opening up and being accepted by your partner.

, If your fears of intimacy or anxiety greatly impact your relationship, consider seeing a therapist. A therapist can help you explore ways to experience intimacy with your partner, work through anxiety, and communicate more effectively. You can see a counselor as a couple or individually, or both.A therapist can help work through problems that may interfere with intimacy, such as past sexual abuse, emotional problems, and can help foster safe and positive attitudes toward sex.

Wear perfume or cologne that contains pheromones.,
Leave your armpits natural.,
Shower or bathe, but skip the soap.",How to Increase Pheromones1," Shop for fragrance products that contain pheromones. Many fragrance companies claim to include pheromones in their products, but they are usually from pigs or deer – which won’t accomplish anything for humans.It’s very debatable whether these fragrances work, however, so don’t spend much money on them.A popular pheromone perfume for women is Pherazone Perfume. This costs around $4.99 per milligram – around $90 a bottle.Other marketed brands include Scent of Eros, Primal Instinct, Realm, Alter Ego, The Edge, Impi, Pheromol Factor, Pheromax, Lure,Yes for Men, Chikara, NPA, Perception Spray, W.A.G.G, Rogue Male, Silent Seduction, and more.;
, It may sound counter-intuitive to boost your stinkiness if you’re looking to attract a mate, but pheromones are supposedly let out through sweat - mainly from your armpits. Try going all natural by staying away from deodorant, or at least using all-natural, non-scented antiperspirant without the added deodorant. Let your natural scent shine through for a boost in pheromones., Stay hygienic by taking showers or baths with hot water, but avoid harsh soaps. Feel free to add some sandalwood essential oil to your shower routine, instead. Staying clean is good, but don’t scrub away all your natural body odor.If you don't smell, don't worry. Pheromones themselves don't have a noticeable scent."

Consider your health.,
Do some cardiovascular exercises.,
Eat to live and love.,
De-stress and relax.",How to Improve Your Love Life by Improving Your Health," In a world where many people choose a junk food over an apple, you'll have to be the one who has the wisdom and willpower to choose the apple. In a world increasingly addicted to TV, you and your mate will have to come up with the willpower to go out on a nature walk or bicycle ride. Because you can't have a super love life unless you treat your body with love and respect. This is not a six-week diet, as you should consider a life-long program of better nutrition. This is not a three-month exercise program here to take off two inches from the waist; consider regular exercise every day of your life.;
, The Harvard School of Public Health reports that men who were physically inactive were 40 percent more likely to experience erectile dysfunction than men who exercised a half hour a day. A foundation of correct nutrition and regular exercise is necessary before we can begin to think about a super love life.

, Most of us do not realize how foods affect our moods, feelings, energy level, and behavior. When a person is ""down in the dumps"", one doesn't automatically say, ""Gosh, I must not have been eating right."" On the other hand, when we're feeling on top of the world we don't stop to think, ""I'd like to feel this good more often."" Many people do not relate how they feel to what they've been eating, but foods, vitamins, and minerals can make all the difference in the world between a so-so love life and the kind of love life that makes you smile every time you think about it. Many people who think they have sex problems are actually victims of poor nutrition. They don't have sex problems. They have food problems. And food problems can be solved.

, The physical effects of long-term stress include colds, ulcers, asthma, heart attack, stroke, and chronic fatigue--all ailments that can erode your health and your love life. Couples can de-stress together at the end of the day in more romantic ways, such as enjoying a lathery bubble bath for two, complete with scented candles, and a mug of warm milk and honey. Or just watch a movie together.

Get at least 8 hours of sleep nightly.,
Exercise with weights regularly.,
Eat foods containing androstenone and androstenol.",How to Increase Pheromones2," Stay well rested by sleeping 7-9 hours a night. This may help boost your pheromone levels.Try these techniques to get good shut eye and stay on a healthy sleep schedule:


Set a regular bedtime for yourself.
Exercise regularly (but not within 3 hours of bedtime so it doesn’t keep you up).
Avoid caffeine after 4pm.
Relax before bed with a warm bath or reading.
Don’t nap too much during the day.
Sleep in a cool, dark room.

, Stick to a regular exercise routine that includes weight-lifting. Target large muscle groups and lift heavier weights for fewer repetitions. Aim to do a workout five days a week. This increases your testosterone, which may have a boosting effect on pheromones.


It’s also possible, however, that pheromones increase testosterone, and not the other way around., These two chemicals are considered human pheromones, and it’s possible that eating foods that contain them may boost yours – or at least increase your arousal, which then triggers more chemical signals that may make you more appealing to potential partners. This has not been proven scientifically, but there’s no harm in trying these three foods:Celery
Parsnips
Truffles (the mushroom, not the chocolate)

You don't have to fake enthusiasm, or even fully understand what she's talking about. Just make an effort to follow her explanations.;
, Don't take the relationship for granted. Set aside time to give each other your full attention, and put in the effort to make it feel special.

, Does she stop to pet dogs on the street? Did she call something you did cute in conversation? Make a mental note of these moments, and she'll probably tell you everything you can do to make her smile without even knowing it.

, ""Sexy"" and ""gorgeous"" can be great in the right context, but people need recognition on other levels as well. Make sure your girlfriend knows you appreciate her intellect and skill.

, Every relationship is different. Remember to think of what your girlfriend enjoys, instead of repeating what worked on your last significant other.

, Sometimes, you have to let your girlfriend be mad, or sad, or whatever it is she's feeling. If she's going through a rough emotional time, don't tell her that everything's okay or that she just needs to cheer up. She should be able to trust you with every emotion she has, and seek support even when she's not up to smiling.

, Even a bad joke, silly voice, or goofy face can make your girlfriend feel better when she's glum. Your own smile and laughter can be infectious.

, Pick up her favorite food on the way to seeing her, or brew her a cup of tea.

, Hug your girlfriend unexpectedly from behind, steal a kiss, or say ""I love you"" in the middle of a conversation. Even holding her hand when she's not expecting it can be a tender moment.

, Brush her nose, stroke her cheek, or run your hand along her neck.

, Hold her close and let her stay there as long as she likes.

, You don't need anything planned to take a walk to the park or have a meal together. If you're girlfriend's feeling down, offer to take her to the movie theater to watch any movie she chooses.


You might make her day by surprising her at work or home, either for a special date or just to spend time together.

, If one of you normally does the cooking, make it a cooperative activity this time. Try looking up a new recipe to make it more fun.


If she always cooks for you, give her a break with breakfast in bed.

, If she doesn't like to be tickled, she may laugh on the outside, but contemplate your death on the inside. If she says she does not like being tickled, take her word for it.

, It might take a little while to figure out what kind of gift your girlfriend likes. Some people love a big expensive gesture, while others might find it impersonal or materialistic. They might appreciate something small or homemade instead.

, There's nothing quite like a massage when you're stressed. Have her lie down on a comfy bed and ask her where she's feeling tense.

Notice that you feel like Wonder Woman around him.,
Make sure you feel comfortable being yourself in front of him.,
Make sure you don't feel ashamed around him.,
See how often you think about future plans.",How to See if He's the One1," He should make you feel like a superhero. You should feel like you can be anybody and do anything when you're with him. You should be unafraid of the challenges in your life because he makes you confident that you are strong enough to get through them. When you're with him, you should feel like you can take on the world and win.;
, This doesn’t just mean being that ""silly you"" that only your close friends or family know; it means letting him see you vulnerable, whether it’s without make-up, after a sweaty workout, when you’re afraid, or while you cry.

, Do you feel the need to hide things around him? If you feel that you need to hide things about yourself or your life, then maybe he's not the one. He should love you no matter what, and if you worry that he'd judge your slightly-hairy wintertime legs, then maybe he isn't the one.

, Do you imagine the two of you cozying up on distant birthdays or holidays? Do you fantasize about the apartment, house, pets, or even children you may one day have together?

"
"
Notice when he says ""I love you"".,
Make sure he doesn't pressure you to become intimate before you are ready.,
Pay attention to whether or not he’s controlling.,
Note whether or not he keeps you from his pals.,
Notice whether or not he alludes to your future.",How to See if He's the One2," It's nice if he says ""I love you too"" after you say it but it's important that you aren't the only person saying the initial I love you. He needs to say it sometimes too. This shows that he thinks about how much he cares about you and that he's not just following the standard script that he feels is expected.


Don't get too worried if he doesn't, though. Some guys are very shy about sharing their feelings. Ask him why he never says it first and tell him that you like to hear it. This might make him more comfortable saying it to you.

, Someone who wants to enjoy your body before your heart is willing clearly doesn’t have your needs in mind. (And if he can’t see past his own desires when it comes to sex, he certainly won’t be able to when it comes to committing or starting a family.)

, If he frequently tells you what to do, tries to run your life, or manipulates your emotions to get what he wants, watch out! This guy is insecure and feels that he has the upper hand in your relationship. ""The one"" will be secure with you and let you be who you are.

, If he refuses to include you in his social plans and avoids telling you what he and the guys did last night, he obviously isn’t willing to include you in his life and might even be up to something shady.

, If the two of you aren’t in the stages of a relationship where you openly discuss future possibilities, pay attention to whether or not he drops any hints. Even something small, like wondering what the two of you will do for an event that’s at least a month or two away, is a good sign.


If he proposes to you too soon (e.g., before 1 year), take some time to analyze why he is rushing. If you are inclined to say yes, suggest a long engagement to be sure.
If he absolutely won't discuss a future together – even after a significant amount of time (say a year) – he is probably not considering one.

See if you naturally remember his birthday, your anniversary, and days that are important to him.,
Notice if you compliment him when he's not looking his best.,
Notice if you’re excited to include him in your life.",How to See if He's the One3," This is one way of determining whether or not he weighs on your thoughts when he’s not around; it’s one thing to make room for someone in your life, but it’s another thing to entirely make room for him in your mind.

, Do you find yourself attracted to him even if he has food in his teeth, or has helmet hair? Or does your attraction wax and wane depending on how well he grooms himself for you?

, Wanting to compliment him to your friends and include him in your family is a major vote of confidence. On the other hand, if you don’t feel secure about a relationship, you may subconsciously find excuses not to introduce or discuss him.


Do you include him in family plans, such as inviting him on your family vacation (or even simply assuming that he will accompany your family without needing an invitation)?
Do you want to help him get along with his family (or even stick up for him) because it’s important that they like you?
Do you suggest that he should call your mother if he needs advice on cooking, cleaning, etc.?

Notice how you change each other.,
Reflect on how he lives his life.,
Notice the ways you both say you care.,
See how comfortable you are in each other’s space.,
Ask yourself if you have a comfortable balance when it comes to spending time together and apart.",How to See if He's the One4," We often change, as people, when we’re around another person a lot (especially someone we care about significantly). Sometimes we change each other for the better and sometimes we change each other for the worse. You will need to decide if you positively impact him and he positively impacts you.


Do you find that either of you is becoming possessive, jealous, distrusting, lazy, or constantly stressed out? This is probably not someone you want to be around. They probably are not the one for you and you will not like the person you become if you stay with them.
Do you find that you inspire each other to be better people? Do you strive for more from life and for yourself when you’re with him? Does he do the same? Do you make each other kinder, happier people? This is a healthy relationship and you will only improve each other’s lives.

, Does it coincide with what you hope your future will be? Does he share the same values? For example, if you recycle and he throws trash out his car window, is this really going to work?

, Is he comfortable letting you see his tender side? Do you openly tell him you love him, even offering qualifiers such as ""I love you a lot"" or initiating the ""I love you more"" game?


Look for discrepancies between what is said and what is communicated. We’re often so blindsided by someone who waxes poetic about their love that we fail to notice whether or not they’ve done anything to back it up. At the same time, we might be so frustrated by someone who doesn’t spout poetry that we overlook all the thoughtful, loving gestures they’ve made. Reflect on whether either of you fits into one of these categories.

, It’s often said that living together is the true test of compatibility; a relationship that takes place entirely in restaurants and parks might be wine and roses, but having to share dishes, watch each other shave, and trip over dirty laundry can dispel an illusion in no time. If you live together, how well do you compromise on individual and shared responsibilities? If you don’t, have you at least swapped keys to each other’s places? And if so, how welcome do you both feel?

, Having your own separate interests will provide for a more interesting relationship and help you both to maintain healthy, independent identities. If the relationship is on the right track, you will feel comfortable and secure even when you are apart.

Consider why you're sending flowers to a girl.,
Consider sending her the flowers she likes the most.,
Send her flowers in her favorite color.,
Send flowers which have a specific meaning.,
Consider fragrance.,
Choose where you'll source the flowers from.,
Decide how to send the flowers.,
Consider where you'll send the flowers.,
Include a card or message note with the flowers.",How to Send Flowers to a Girl," There are lots of good reasons to send flowers but there are also some not-so-good ones, so you'll need to get sorted on the message you send along with those flowers.


Good reasons for sending flowers: To express your love; to say Happy Birthday; to say Congratulations; to express support for exams/work interviews/try-outs, etc.; to express sympathy for a loss; to say you miss her; to woo her; to ask for forgiveness, etc.
Times when not to send flowers: To try to woo back an ex who has made it absolutely clear you're both through; where the girl has made it clear she hates flowers; she's allergic to flowers; when you can't afford flowers.;
, If you don't know this yet, ask someone who is close to her, like her mom, a bestie or a sibling. Ask that person to keep it quiet.

, This is a good choice when you really don't know what flowers she likes (and you can't find out) or her favorite flowers are out of season or too expensive.

, Many flowers have a meaning. You can find more out about this by reading How to express yourself using the language of flowers.

, If the girl likes scents, look for flowers with a lovely fragrance. Ask the florist for help. Commonly liked fragrant flowers include freesias, roses, frangipani, gardenia and jasmine.

, There are various options here:


Visit a local florist. This has the benefit of being able to talk to the florist for advice and you'll be able to see the actual flowers and arrangements.
Look at online florists. You'll be able to see images of what they send, along with prices and delivery fees.
Pick your own. You could pick flowers from your own garden and make your own arrangement. This is a lovely gesture that she'll likely find very touching.

, It's standard to have them delivered by a florist or specialist deliverer. However, you can deliver them yourself, either by leaving them at a place where she'll get them but not showing yourself, or turning up and surprising her in person.

, You could send them to her workplace, her home, or to a place you know she'll be at for an activity such as exercising at the gym.


Consider sending her flowers if she's on an extended business trip and you're missing her. It'll remind her how much you care. You'll need to find her hotel address.
Sending flowers to her workplace is a lovely way of showing you care; all of her coworkers will be curious, which adds to the thrill.

, Keep it short and sweet, getting to the point quickly and signing it off (unless you're doing it for Valentine's Day as a secret admirer). Examples include:


""I miss you!"" Love, Fred
""Thinking of you, hope all is going well."" Love, Sam
""Roses are red, violets are blue, but these daffodils remind me of the sunshine of you."" Love, Corey
""Sorry to learn about your dog, Max. Hope he'll be better soon."" Hugs, Jeff

If this is someone who should not be asking you for sex because you do not know them or because of your relationship, say “I don’t think that question is appropriate for you to ask me.” You should leave and find a friend.
If the request is more vague, for example, if someone is trying to get you to have sex and says ""don't you think I'm cute"", you should say ""that is not what this is about.” Acknowledging their remark will help you seem confident and strong.;
, Do not avoid saying no. It is important to be confident and clear so that they know you are serious. Depending on whether you know this person or not, you can say different things to explain.


If this is someone you are interested in but you don’t want to have sex, you can say “thank you for the invitation, but no, I don't have sex.” Depending on how close you are, you can explain to the person your reasons.
If you are with someone you might want to have sex with in the future, you can say “Thank you for asking, but no, I don't want to have sex until I know you even better.”
If this is someone who is just your friend, say “thank you for asking, but no, I just want to be friends.”

, After you say no, you can follow it up by saying ""thank you for the dance”. Say this sincerely and explain why you enjoyed yourself. You can say, for example, “I had so much fun seeing this band.” This can distract from the awkwardness and remind them of the setting and situation.

, If this is someone you do not know, say “have a good night” and then leave. Be nice and genuine when you say this if they have been respectful to you. If you are with someone you know, move on and do something else. For example, you can say “let’s go find our friends”.


If you do not know the person and you feel uncomfortable, find your friends or get out your cell phone to show the person that you are busy.

, If they ask you again, continue to stand your ground. For example, if your friend suggests sex to you again, you can say “I said no. I don’t want to have sex.” You want to be bold and restate that you do not want to have sex so that they do not ask you again. You don’t have to explain yourself again. But say it confidently and clearly.


If they keep suggesting sex, you should leave. You will not be able to have a good time with this person if they are mainly interested in having sex, and you do not want to have sex.

, If things are moving faster or physically toward sex, stop it before it goes any further. Move away from the person if they are moving in. If it has progressed further, take off the hand, arm, or body part that is making the advance off of you. If the person is more forcefully touching you, say “stop” firmly and loudly. If they keep going, push your hands out from your body, and you should get away from them.


Do not feel bad about stopping the action. If someone is trying to force sex on you, you need to respect yourself and your body. This is your body and you have a right to defend yourself as well as say no to any kind of unwanted physical advance.

Know that you like your partner.,
Nurture trust.,
Have realistic expectations of your partner and your relationship.,
Come up with a shared vision of the future, something that you can both work towards.,
Talk.,
Communicate your love.,
Keep your lives interesting by making sure that you do things together.",How to Improve the Odds That Your Love Will Last for an Eternity," In order to build a love that will last an eternity you need the right partner, no surprise there. You will have heard the time-worn saying that opposites attract, well it's true, they also happen to have the worst statistics for break-ups. You want to find someone who you have something in common with, shared interests that start you of with a common bond and give you something to work on. If you don't have any shared interests or common ground, then you will start of your relationship with the temporary bond formed by infatuation. You don't know who you are going to fall in love with, but having an idea of what match can work will give you a better chance for a lasting relationship.;
, You don't just need the right partner, you need to be able to like them as well. Your partner has to be your best friend, the one that you can confide in, turn to, and the one who is always there for you, standing by your side.

, Relationships are built on a foundation of trust. Trust is something that you give freely to your partner, but it is a very fragile thing and if you betray your spouses trust it can take a long time to regain it. If you want your love to last an eternity, then start your relationship as you mean to go on by being totally honest with each other. You need to be totally open and honest with each other which means sharing your feelings and emotions, hopes and dreams. In a loving relationship, although you can have your own private thoughts you do not keep secrets from each other (apart that is for what you are getting them for their Birthday and Christmas). Being open and honest with each other will bring you much closer together. It might feel intrusive at first, but what you get from sharing will more than outweigh any discomfort.

, You have to be able to accept that the fantasy of an ideal romance that you read about in books is not going to happen, so don't waste your life looking for something that does not exist. Accept your partner for who they are, the good bits and the irritating ones, after all, that is the person that you fell in love with. Don't go trying to change your partner into something that they are not, you could drive them away or change them into someone who you do not love. Just as you have to accept your partner you also need to accept your relationship for what it is. Again, trying to change it to fit some fantasy ideal will destroy something that could otherwise have been very special.

, This can be achieved by setting joint goals, where to live, when to start a family, the list is endless. Have a number of goals running at any one time. Every time that you achieve a goal then set a new one. This way you are both working to and looking to the future. It will give your relationship a sense of permanence and continuity.

, If you don't talk to each other, then the next however many years are going to be seriously boring. If you don't talk then you will start to distance yourself from each other, and the longer it goes on the further apart you will go until your reach the stage that your relationship breaks up. Communication connects you, it binds your lives together, it transmits who you are to your partner. Without communication you would know nothing about your partner, their likes and dislike, what they need, when they need help, and when they just need you. If you want your love to last an eternity you have to communicate.

, It's no good being madly in love with someone if you are incapable of communicating your love to them. If they do not know (which you need to demonstrate by word and deed) that you love them then why should they invest any love or emotion in trying to build a relationship with you? The fact that you love and appreciate them needs to be transmitted to them each and every day, for all eternity. Don't just tell them that you love them, words are cheap, show them. Hug them, hold them, hold their hand, touch them, tell them that you love them, leave them cards to find, call them, email them, it doesn't matter what, just let them know. Don't make this a routine thing, it will become meaningless if you do, do it because you want to, and don't do the same all the time, keep it fresh, exciting and interesting.

, You could pursue those shared interests or find new ones, go on dates, find new things to do, new places to see. It's not always easy to find the time, so synchronize schedules. It doesn't have to be anything elaborate, a walk in the park or going for a coffee can do you the world of good.

, Your partner should respect the fact that you want to be responsible and communicate about sex. It will ultimately improve your relationship if you are good communicators about sex.


You can start by asking them about how they feel about your sex life. You want them to know that their feelings matter and that you are interested in hearing them out.
Explain that this conversation is not a rejection.
You may also want to explain that this conversation is not a negotiation of what you will do sexually.
Explain that this conversation should be a mutual exchange of boundaries, solutions and communication needs. , Do not be embarrassed about using sex vocabulary with your partner to talk about sex. You can laugh about it, but the communication is the important part. So push through the awkwardness and say what you need to say about your boundaries. , You can ask the person to wait for a yes before going further when you are being physical. Also, tell the person to wait before acting after they ask. Adding this element of communication to your physical relationship can also make the intimacy more exciting as well as safe.

, If one person is not in the mood to have sex they should say so, and explain their no.

Maybe you know that you don't like to have sex when the kids are at home.

, Tell the person confidently and in clear language what you are not comfortable doing. Be extra clear about what is too far sexually. For example, say “I do not want to have oral sex.”


Sounding ambiguous or vague will not help you communicate, so be clear.
Additionally, you may find that you feel even better and have better self confidence after you have stated your boundaries. , Take time to talk about why you feel the way you do. Tell the person the reasons you have for making these boundaries. Say “I don’t want to do this because of this reason/experience/feeling. How do you feel about that?” You want the other person to be an active part of this conversation.


This conversation can help you connect emotionally with the other person. Perhaps you are having this conversation because this person keeps pushing a certain sexual boundary. You need to acknowledge this as the reason for the conversation. You do not need to condemn the person, but you need to communicate what their actions are doing. For example, you can say “I need you to stop doing _____. It makes me feel this way/experience this/go through this.”

Understand the involuntary responses and subconsciousness causes passionate ""attraction, sometimes called love,"" and may be related to the immune system.,
See the one--Your eye and subconscious visual responses influence ""love"" concerning ""physical attributes."",
Think and remember.--Mental reactions and traits may be a more subconsciously important factors for the female choosing her mate than for the male.,
Look good.--From the guy's perspective it is more about appearance.,
React to emotional pressure.,
Feel the effects of your hormones--they have important power in emotions including ""love."",
Stay together...--That may have more to do with family love than sexual attractiveness, after a few years.",How to Understand Love As a Chemical Reaction," As humans, we benefit by having a diverse gene pool. If this weren't true, one disease could wipe us all out. Therefore, animals and insects developed a way to tell each other apart by the use of pheromones and the reactions in the immune systems. These are scents that may influence us to decide subconsciously if we are sexually interested in a person. While a guy may smell great to you, he might disgust your best friend. So, if you enjoy a man's smell, there's a chance that your immune systems operate slightly differently from hers, and you may even have different blood types and different levels of certain hormones.;
, Believe it or not, this is possibly the clincher on whether or not we decide that this person is suitable to us. Now, to comprehend this, we have to know that in essence humans are not really that different from the less cerebral animals subconsciously. From the girl's perspective--if a guy has big muscles, you may consciously think he's good looking. What you don't realize is that you're actually more deeply interested in how well he might protect you and your children. Surprising? A tall man can exert power over other males, which is a plus as well.

, After all, if a man looks good but grunts whenever you ask him to do something for you, you may remember that and realize that he isn't that good for you. Another woman may react totally differently to that strong silent type.

, Larger buttocks and hips could make childbirth easier and give a higher success rate. Women may also dress their best when they are at peak levels of fertility.

, This is related to excitement, and even stress also has a lot to do with subconscious functions of the brain concerning ""love"". There is good stress (like attraction) and bad stress (called distress). When you seem to have found a prospective mate, neurotransmitters are sent throughout your brain to emotionally make a good link to that person. Ever miss your boyfriend/girlfriend to the point of heartache? Chemical, nervous reactions are the cause of it. Dopamine is said to be the principle chemical involved in giving us strong urges like sexual attraction over time. Romantic love is not just an emotion--but rather, a whole motivational system with a reward drive to get you to stick with that person. While this is going on, we have a decrease in serotonin, which if elevated, leads to feelings of obsession or something like an addiction...

, If a man is or is not interested in having a baby with a specific woman (at a specific time), his hostility and oxytocin and testosterone may increase or decrease. This is because the body is trying to ensure that his genes are passed on to the right kind of person, and encourages him to seek ""his-type"" which is even if he has to look elsewhere for that person or feeling. This also occurs when a woman does not see a man as a person suitable for a long term relationship, or is not fully interested in that relationship herself. The two previously mentioned neurotransmitters are also what cause love to fade. After all, if you've done your job, had sex/raised a child, there isn't any more need for that chemical reaction.

, If a man and woman are committed to their children, family and each other--and the futures of all concerned--then they will often (about half of people) be dedicated to stay together in ""mature love"" to help each other and to maintain a home and family long after ""raging hormones"" of youth and the pheromones have subsided.

(Google it, read it from a newspaper, book, etc.) Next time you and your significant other are at the dinner table or riding in the car, wow them with your newly found knowledge about their interests––be ready to ask questions too. After the first conversation dies out (if it does), then swap subjects.;
, Take a 20-minute walk and talk about it. Ask each other questions, such as: Did you like it? What was your favorite and least favorite part? Favorite character? Favorite line? Did you like the ending? What would you have done differently? Pick your partners' brain for that juicy knowledge.

, Play: What's your favorite... would you rather... what would you do... if you were stuck on a desert island... etc. And get weird with it!


For example: If you fell from the empire state building, do you think you would die if you were an ant? It seems childish, but it's good to connect to that side around the person we trust the most. Don't hold back!

, Have one person make up the beginning of the story. Then you or your partner makes up the next sentence of the story. Continue taking turns, making up each line for the story, until you have this ridiculously funny story. This exercise will get both of your creative juices flowing and could inspire you to have another topic for conversation.

, Is your boyfriend building a birdhouse? Grab a hammer and offer to lend a hand. Is your wife working on a mini robot? Volunteer to help her test it and watch it go. This gives you the opportunity to learn from your spouse, and understand the things that make them light up.

Make sure that you mean it.,
Consider your intentions.,
Put yourself in her shoes.,
Try starting with less serious words.",How to Tell a Girl That You Love Her1," If you have never been in love before, it may be hard to understand the implications of this phrase. There are many types of love: friendly love, familial love, romantic love. If you truly feel that you are romantically in love with this girl, then go ahead and say it – but understand the gravity of your words.

Love is notoriously hard to define. Some say that young people tend to confuse ""true love"" with a shallower level of infatuation or ""puppy love."" Others believe that you can feel deep, meaningful love at any age. The point being: love means something different to everybody.
If this is your first meaningful relationship with a girl, think before you say ""I love you."" Sometimes, you ""just know"" when you love someone. However, if you've only been together for a few weeks—or even a few months—it might be wise to wait a while before you drop the ""L-word."";
, Do not tell a girl ""I love you"" just to get into her pants, or to get her to pay more attention to you. Only say this if you plan to follow up on your words. Romantic love typically implies a level of care and commitment to a person, and you don't want to make this promise if you are going to be ""in love"" with someone else in a week., Do you think that this girl loves you back? Has she been in love before, or is this her first emotionally-serious relationship? Be aware that ""I love you"" can be a heavy phrase to drop onto a budding relationship. If she isn't ready to say the words back, then you might actually make things more complicated with your admission.


Think about the way that she acts around you. You should be able to tell if she likes you by the way she looks at you and the amount of attention that she gives you. If you're going to tell her that you love her, she should at least have said that she likes you a lot.

, Feelings are feelings, but you don't have to jump right into an ""I love you."" Tell her how much you like her, and use your words and actions to show her that she means a lot to you. Give her thoughtful compliments; buy or make her a personal gift; and show your passion through physical interactions.


Say, ""I want you to know that I care really deeply for you. You've brought so much happiness into my life, and I truly value that.""Say, ""I like you a lot. You make me really happy."" She'll know how you feel, but she won't have to worry about the serious implications of ""love.""
Say that you love something about her, not that you love her. This can be a solid way to ease into the conversation. For instance, say, ""I love the way you smile when you hear your favorite song,"" or ""I love your eyes. They're absolutely captivating.""

"
"
Wait for a special moment.,
Be patient.,
Do it when you're both clearheaded.,
Have her full attention.,
Choose a happy time rather than a sad time.,
Don't stress too much.",How to Tell a Girl That You Love Her2," ""I love you,"" is a serious thing to say, and it can completely change the dynamic of a relationship. Once you've decided to tell her that you love her, be on the lookout for intimate, meaningful moments. This might happen during a beautiful sunset after a perfect day together, or when ""your song"" comes on during a big school dance, or when you're both laughing together, wildly happy simply to be with one another. The moment might be sweepingly dramatic, or it might be wonderfully simple. Say it when you feel truly inspired.


Watch romantic scenes in movies and shows for inspiration. The ""right moment"" might feel powerful and almost cinematic – like the scene when the guy gets the girl, and they tell each other how they feel.

, Don't just blurt it out the next time that you see her. If you love her, and she loves you, then you will have plenty of time to say it – and to say it again, and again! It's normal to feel a sense of urgency to confess your love. However, it's good to be tactful, and the moment may make for a better memory if you wait for something special.

, Don't say ""I love you"" for the first time while either of you is tipsy or otherwise intoxicated. Avoid saying it directly after sex – in the midst of the post-coital endorphin rush, it is easy to say or agree to things that you don't mean.Let the moment be simple, pure, and real.

, Don't throw out your first ""I love you,"" when she is distracted with something else, or when she is worried about something, or when she is preparing to leave. The words will be more powerful if you're gazing into each other's eyes. If you're having a special moment together, it shouldn't be hard to bring her in close. Consider saying ""I love you"" after a hug or a kiss, in a simple moment.


Sometimes, admittedly, there will be no ""right time."" You can get her attention by saying, ""I need to tell you something important.""
Not all attention is good attention. Do not say ""I love you"" to placate her when she's angry, or when she's trying to tell you something else that's important.

, If you're really trying to say ""I love you,"" it may come out when it comes out, regardless of your planning. It may be best, however, to say the words when you're both in a great mood. A sincere ""I love you"" can certainly cheer a girl up when she's sad or feeling inadequate – but a first admission of love might be a bit much in one of these moments.

, If she loves you back, it won't really matter how you say it. If she doesn't love you back, then you've learned a valuable lesson about love. Either way: life is too short to bottle up these feelings, to let love lay in hiding when it could soar. Be brave, and be true, and follow your heart. It will be okay.


If you need to calm your nerves, try taking deep breaths. Inhale, slowly, for as long as possible, and then gradually exhale in a measured flow. Focus only on the act of breathing: on the in-and-out of your breath.

"
"
Look into her eyes when you say it.,
Say, ""I love you."",
Listen.,
Kiss her.",How to Tell a Girl That You Love Her3," When the time feels right, lock eyes with her. You may experience a moment of absolute stillness – as though time has stopped, temporarily, and there is nothing that exists beyond you and her. Eye contact signals that you are sincere. It also gives you an immediate indication of how she feels about what you're saying, and it should make the two of you feel more connected.

, It's as simple as that. If you truly love her, then you don't need to explain yourself or add any frills. If you feel so inclined, however, it never hurts to wax poetic and qualify your love a bit. Above all, be honest and authentic. Only say as much as you feel impelled to say.


Consider explaining the story of how you came to love her. Say something true, and honest, and sweet. Make it unique, and make her feel special.
The way you say the words is up to you. You can say it casually or earnestly, depending on your comfort level. Make sure that she knows you're serious – unless you want to give yourself an out.

, Give her time. You have told her that you love her, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she's ready to say it back. Be patient and kind. Hope, but do not presume. Let her process your words and respond in her own time.


If she doesn't say it back right away, that's okay. She feels how she feels, and you feel how you feel. You may be hurt, but do not be angry. Respect her right to keep her own counsel.
No matter her response, be proud of yourself for telling her how you feel. It takes a lot of courage to tell someone that you love them, and mean it. Whatever happens: now she knows.

, If she says ""I love you"" back: smile, hug her, kiss her, bed her. This is a special time. Ride the wave of loving emotion and take the experience to an even more magical level. No matter what happens, this is a moment in your life that you will remember for years to come.

Establish physical contact.,
Be his partner in interests.,
Be frank.",How to Turn a Guy from a Friend Into Love," For all those wondering about this unusual suggestion, it is important that you first confirm whether you are really into this guy romantically. It might just be a misconception of your feelings to start with. Once you are sure about your feelings for this guy friend of yours, you can begin formulating the ultimate game plan to transform him into your sweetheart. Ask yourself:


Are there butterflies when you're around him? Do you feel as if your heart skips a beat when he is near you? How do you feel about him when you're apart?
Has anything intense happened between the two of you lately? For example, experiencing grief, loss, hurt, tough times, etc. It's important to disentangle your feelings from having shared a deep experience, as you don't want to mistake what you've gone through together for romantic feelings. Be sure that your feelings go well beyond a deepening of your friendship.
Can you see this being long term? It's not a great idea to lose a friend when things go sour. You must reasonably foresee a good chance of this change to an intimate relationship as going the distance.;
, It is essential that your friend too has some feelings for you romantically. Or else it can all too soon turn into a situation wherein you assume the role of a stalker. You can give him suggestive loving looks and see if he responds in kind. For a more thick skinned person, you can try asking him out for a dinner or lunch, depending on his favourite time of the day. Make sure it's just for the two of you. If he is enthusiastic about it, it definitely means that something is cooking.


Is he even free? It's not nice to bust up his relationship with someone else. It's not useful to try to come between him and a sporting or academic pursuit that he's already told you is all he is concentrating on for now. Be reasonable.

, What's better than physical contact to establish intimacy between two individuals? Try hugging or kissing him on the cheek whenever there is an opportunity. Guys respond well to physical affection. It will establish the much needed intimacy which takes your relationship to the next level. It will give him a clue that you are ready to be something more other than being his friend.

, Try to find out about his favourite activities. If you are ignorant about his hobbies, it won't help you much. Gather information about his hobbies and try to make yourself knowledgeable about them.


For instance, if he is into basketball, make sure you are aware of the rules and regulations of the game even though you are not keen on playing the game. This will establish a line of understanding between you two.

, It is said that there is only a fine line between friendship and love. Once you find that you are in love, it's always better to come clean about your intentions to him. Guys appreciate frankness in a girl. Even if he is not interested in you initially, this will give him the guts to approach you if he develops feelings for you later. It will also help him to see you in a different light other than being a friend.

Communicate your love nonverbally.",How to Tell Your Girlfriend That You Love Her," One of the biggest questions people have is when (how long into the relationship) they should tell their significant other that they love them. This, though, varies from men to women. One study has noted that men take 88 days to tell their girlfriends that they love them, while women take significantly longer. As a result of this, you need to make sure that you’re not rushing the relationship:


Make sure she’s sent signals to you that she feels the same, even if she hasn’t told you that she loves you.
Don’t tell her you love her during the first couple of weeks of dating. This is far too soon, and inappropriate. While there may be some couples who are sure of their love so early on, chances are, it’s not you.
If it feels too early, it probably is too early to tell her you love her. Wait a bit longer. If she feels the same way, it can’t hurt to wait a little bit.;
, Perhaps the best time to tell her you love her is when you feel comfortable in your relationship and want to move it to the next level. There is no specific timeline on this, and it varies from relationship to relationship, so you need to gauge your own relationship and your comfort level before telling her you love her., Telling her that you love her is not something you want to rush. You need to wait for an appropriate moment in which you’ll be able to express yourself and she’ll be able to respond. While you want to wait for an appropriate moment, consider:


That there is no “perfect” moment. If you’re waiting for the perfect moment, you might wait forever.
Don’t tell her when her complete attention is not on you.
Don’t tell her when you’re in the process of coming into contact with other people.
Consider a natural pause in the conversation after she’s said something sweet to you. This way, your admission of love will be a reciprocation of her own feelings., Letting her know that you love her should be something you tell her when you’re alone. This doesn’t mean that you have to be completely isolated from everyone when you tell her, but you certainly want to have at least a low level of intimacy between the two. Consider:


Never tell her in front of a group of friends.
Don’t tell her when you are in front of your or her family.
Generally, the less people the better. If you’re alone talking in a crowd, that’s okay. But if you’re the center of attention in the crowd, that might be a bit awkward for one or both of you.

, If at all possible, you should let her know about how you feel in a natural way. While you’re going to probably think about doing it ahead of time, try not to script it out word for word and time it to the exact minute. It will come across as more sincere if it seems natural., The best time to say “I love you” is when you’re sober and alert. There are a number of reasons for this. If you’re not sober and alert, you might botch the delivery. If you’re drunk or tired, your girlfriend might question your motives or think that you don’t really mean what you’re saying.


Don’t be drunk and say “I love you.” Of course, a glass of wine or a beer should be alright (if you’re of age).
Don’t say “I love you” after you’ve been partying.
The more alert you are, the chances are the better you’ll be able to convey your true feelings., Some men prefer to give their girlfriend a gift, present it, and then tell their lady how much she means to him. This is certainly an acceptable way of conveying your love. However, consider:


Inexpensive thoughtful gifts that are homemade or represent something in your relationship.
A necklace or bracelet (if you know she’s been interested in something like this).
It might come off as contrived.
Don’t make your gift too grandiose, because it could seem like you are trying to buy her.
Try not to make a spectacle out of presenting the gift, this could be embarrassing.
Only you know your relationship dynamic, so use your best judgement based on both of your comfort levels and expectations.

, Telling your girlfriend you love her is something you don’t want to overthink. If you overthink it, it might come off awkward or contrived. Instead, trust your feelings and your intuition. If it feels like the right moment to tell her you love her, then do it., A romantic dinner is a wonderful place to tell your girlfriend that you love her. It’ll set the atmosphere, give you both time to talk and enjoy each other’s company, and give you the opportunity to tell her.


A nice restaurant that you both enjoy will work great.
Consider a home cooked meal.
If cooking at home, try to set the meal apart from everyday meals you might already enjoy together. If appropriate, light a candle and put on some lite music.

, Picnics are a nice of way of spending time together with an atmosphere that suggests intimacy but is not too suggestive. Chances are, you’ll both enjoy the picnic, and use it as a time to talk and bond more than you have already. It might create the perfect opportunity to give her your news., Perhaps you want to let her know in the heat of the moment – when you’re kissing or making out. This works for some people, but there are some potential pitfalls you need to be careful about.


Don’t expect sex. She could think that you are saying it in order to butter her up for sex.
Don’t tell her during sex. This could come off as insincere.
Don’t tell her immediately after sex. Instead, wait a few hours at minimum, or even a couple of days.
Make sure it comes out naturally, and not as some grand sexual plan for the evening., There are a number of reasons why you should avoid entertainment venues for this sort of thing. Most importantly, her attention won’t be on you. But there are other reasons as well:


You both might be under the scrutiny of others, which could be awkward.
If she’s a private person, she might be mad that you shared such a big thing with the whole world.
Only you know your relationship and your significant other, so use your best judgement.

, If you’re both over-the-top, out-going, and flamboyant personalities, then maybe you can consider a grandiose moment to tell her you love her. While this is not recommended for most people, it might be right for you – but ultimately, only you know your relationship and your significant other. If you are the type of person who wants to do this, consider:


Hiring a plane trailing a sign “I love you <name>” over a sporting event or some other event where you and your girlfriend will be outside.
Sending her dozens of roses with a card that says I love you. If you want to go really over the top, you can send this to her work. It might be inappropriate, though.
There are many other over-the-top ways of conveying your love, just make sure you think it’s right for your relationship., If you think it’s the right time and place, just tell her directly, “I love you.” This is extremely direct, but it’s simple and it will convey what you are feeling. Of course there are a few ways to slightly soften this direct approach:


Say something like “I have a confession to make…” then “I love you.”
Ask her for her hand, and tell her you love her.
Lead into a conversation about how you see the rest of your life, and then tell her you love her.

, You can tell her you love her in an indirect approach, if you feel more comfortable doing so. However, be warned. While this might alleviate some of the stress and anxiety for you, it might take some of the magic out of the moment. If you do go with the indirect approach, consider:


Spelling “I love you” on a mirror or another surface.
Sending her flowers with a card that says “I love you.”
Write her a “love letter” and snail mail it to her.
Understand that an indirect approach could be construed as a grandiose admission of love, too. , Sharing your love in a nonverbal way is something many people do. There are pros and cons to this approach. First, a nonverbal signal of love might mean more than just mere words. However, it could also lack the force and emotion of a direct verbal approach. If you’re going to go nonverbal, consider:


Looking into her eyes at the right moment. If you have a true connection, she’ll understand.
Holding her and kissing her on the neck at the right moment and at the right place. Perhaps you’re on a beach watching the sunset. This action might say much more than words could communicate.
Be warned that this approach might be considered a cop-out by some, and might not actually communicate what you want. Only you and your partner can know."

Don’t allow the pressures of dating become overbearing to you.,
Be honest with who you are.,
Be forward.,
Carry on a positive attitude.,
Listen to him.,
Talk honestly about the situation.,
Touch on other subjects throughout conversation.,
Breathe.",How to Tell Your Date You Have a Child (for Single Mothers)," It is all right if your friends get dressed up for their dates. Take time to relax and take care of you first. Do not date until you are ready and comfortable. Don’t allow yourself to feel guilty about dating. You are not leaving your children behind. It is more than normal to want more than a sit down on a couch with your child watching cartoons. Your child is priority but the need of companionship is perfectly fine and you are deserving of it.;
, As a single mother, it can be noted that there may be the need to escape from who you are. We have all heard of men who refuse to be with single mothers. No person wants to be refused or turned down so it is a natural feeling to want to hide a part of yourself and, at times, your own children. Knowing that there are men out there who will be accepting of you should stick with you as you begin dating. Let's face it, when you are on that future date eventually the phone will ring, and the sitter will be calling about your child’s tummy ache. (Well hopefully not.) In any case, have no shame because “mom” is the title that you possess so accept it as you date.

, Letting him know upfront who you are and the child in your life is perfectly okay. Waiting to tell him may not be in your best interest. The first couple of dates are about getting to know the other person. Remember, you are not telling him your life story. Simply, you are letting him know the person he is engaging himself with. Having him fall for you first before you mention that you have a child may not be as beneficial to you as it would be for him getting to know you. Wouldn’t you want to know up front if this guy is accepting of you as a single mother? On your end, you want a man who will want to be with you and your child. The ideal man should be genuine and honest. If he walks away after the mention of a “baby” it is okay, then he wasn’t meant for you.

, There is more to children than the madness that can be carried on a daily basis. For those who do not have children, the pre-notion may be that the little ones give gray hairs and drive parents up walls. Although fairly true, having a child is a beautiful thing. There is beauty in having children and the experiences that are shared and let him know this too. Embrace your life as it is and let him know that in time it can be a life that he can share into also.

, His reaction may be positively surprising to you. He may ask more about your child/children. There may be some men who may not be interested in dating a woman with a child and that is normal. For any man, dating a single mother is different than dating a single young lady. For your sake, if the man is not interested he may not have been the one. Try to listen to his views and his reaction.

, Realize what this means for him as well as yourself. There are post-challenges ahead when dating and having children. Although nothing to fear, it will be new for him. Briefly getting an idea of how it could work is a step into the right direction.

, Your child does not have to be the highlight of your date. Let him know that you have other interests and other things on your mind. Get to know him. A simple mention of children is enough. There should not be any need to continue further with “kid subjects” unless you want to. Once kids are introduced to your date or new man in your life, you may leave your child / children vulnerable.

, You did it. Whether he is in good standing with the package deal and wants another date or not. You held the confidence to tell him.

Say it when you feel it.,
Wait for a special moment.,
Keep perspective.,
Be appropriate.",How to Tell Someone They Are Beautiful1," You don't need an excuse to tell anyone that he or she is beautiful. Sometimes there really isn't a ""reason"" to tell someone they're beautiful; but you do it anyway. Maybe the light's hitting them just right; maybe they're wearing a stunning gown; or maybe you want to kiss them. If you feel an overwhelming urge to tell someone that he or she is beautiful: just do it.;
, You can certainly say ""You're beautiful,"" at any time, but the statement might come across as more meaningful if you have the person's full attention. Say it during an intimate moment, when you're one-on-one. Try not to put him or her on the spot.


If you're telling a friend, lover, or significant other that he/she is beautiful, try saying it in a quiet moment when you're speaking one-on-one or looking into each other's eyes. Let the words come out naturally.
Consider writing a note. This can be a great way to create an intimate moment if you're shy, or if you can't be present for some other reason.
Say it as a greeting. Try greeting a date by telling him or her, ""You look absolutely beautiful tonight!"" Avoid saying it if the date is dressed casually. Save it for when they have clearly put some effort into their appearance.

, Your words don't need to imply anything more than what they mean at face value. There are many reasons to let someone know they're beautiful, and not all of these reasons are romantic. Try not to think too much about it. If you think that someone is beautiful, then it's usually a good idea to let them know.

, When you say it and how you say it are not nearly as important as 'what' you say. Inundating a simple acquaintance with over-enthusiastic or overly detailed praise can often trigger a cautionary or even a repulsed response. Avoid accenting detailed physical characteristics (like fitness, or the sizes of certain body portions) until you and the subject know each other very well. Further, refrain from discussing such things in the company of others. When in doubt, comment on the most superficial of aspects first and wait until they are comfortable in hearing more.

Get out of your comfort zone.,
Increase your confidence.,
Give yourself reminders to be romantic.",How to Say Romantic Things1," It is important to be comfortable in your relationships with the people you love, but not to the point of complacency. Romance and relationships thrive the most when routine and comfort are places you let go of in favor of getting out of your comfort zone.Create opportunities for romance in ways that you haven’t been doing lately. Break out of your routine, go somewhere new, and make an effort to create memorable date nights.
Check out new and different places to try out around your neck of the woods. You can visit new restaurants or do some research on events happening around the city.
Play different games and/or have some adventure in how you approach being intimate with one another.;
, Be open to giving love and receiving love by increasing your self esteem. Focus on ways you can build your self confidence.Change the way you think about yourself. Even if you are not the most romantic person in the world, don’t look at yourself negatively. Instead, focus on the positives about yourself and what you do bring to the table.
View the failures you have had as opportunities to learn. This is another way to accentuate the positives and eliminate the negatives. You will have more self-confidence moving forward.

, In the beginning, it might be necessary to make little notes to make an effort to be more romantic. Over time, the effort will become second nature.


Designate at least one night a week as a date night to create a romantic dynamic to your relationship.
Use your partner’s response(s) to you as inspiration to do and say more romantic things.
Write in your planner to say something romantic to your partner on a daily basis, whether it be directly, through email, or through text.

Say it simply.,
Find a unique way to say it.,
Be sincere.,
Compliment specific features.,
Consider using a less strong word than ""beautiful.""",How to Tell Someone They Are Beautiful2," Just say, ""You're beautiful."" You don't need anything more complicated. Look directly into the person's eyes, and earnestly tell them what you think. Say it with a smile.


Try qualifying your words with a superlative. Say, ""You are absolutely beautiful,"" or ""You are so beautiful.""

, There's nothing wrong with a simple, ""You're beautiful,"" but you can also make your statement more poetic or romantic by choosing your words more carefully. Be aware that some people might prefer a simple and straightforward compliment, whereas others with a more lyrical bent might swoon over grand words.


Use a synonym for beautiful: gorgeous, stunning, breathtaking, lovely, radiant, or exquisite. Make sure that you understand the subtle connotations of the word that you use.Instead of simply stating that this person is beautiful, try telling them how their beauty makes you feel. Say, ""You are so beautiful that I can't take my eyes off of you,"" or ""My heart beats faster when you look my way."", Some people are attuned to vocal patterns and body language to the point that they can tell when someone is saying something ""just to say it."" The compliment need not turn into an over-dramatic production – but try to keep it authentic., One way to tailor your statement to this particular person is to point out something unique that makes them beautiful. This could be anything: eyes, hair, smile, skin. Go deeper than the skin, and try to compliment his/her personality. Beauty means much more than looks.Say, ""You have the most beautiful smile. It always brightens my day."" Try saying, ""Your eyes are absolutely stunning. I get lost in them."" Tell him/her, ""You have such beautiful hair!"" or ""Your skin is flawless.""
If this person gets a lot of compliments for his or her beauty, try pointing out the features that don't get complimented as often. The person may spend a lot of time on their hair or makeup. However, they might be be especially flattered if you find something to say about their ears, their hands, their nose – or their personality.

, If you aren't sure how someone feels about you, then you might say that he or she is ""cute"" or ""pretty."" These words may not have the same heft as ""beautiful,"" but that might be a good thing if you aren't sure. On the other hand: if you truly think that someone is beautiful, then it might be worth your while to suck up your courage and tell them exactly how you feel.

Be enamored with her smile and say something like, “Your smile can brighten up the cloudiest days.”Compliment her spirit and energy by saying something like, “I love who I am/who I’ve become when I’m with you.”, A lot of men experience a hard time when it comes to admitting faults or offering apologies. If that little voice inside of you is saying that you’re wrong, admit it aloud to the woman in your life without fear of it being sign of weakness.For example, saying the three simple words “I was wrong” is all the effort a woman needs sometimes.
Those three words can be given during subtle moments too. Wrap your arms around her from behind, give a soft kiss to her neck, and say them to her.

, Show her your affectionate side without the underlying sex agenda. Show her that she can enjoy the comfort of being held without feeling pressured to reciprocate it with getting physical immediately after.Say to your woman, “I’d love if I could hold you tonight.”
Pose it as a question and ask her permission, “Do you think I can just hold you tonight?”

, Women appreciate it when their partners can see their weariness and stressed and actively do something about it to counter it. Put aside your desires and become fully available to give her love in those moments.Verbally recognize how much she is deserving of your concern and love her in moments where it counts the most.

Verbalize your willingness by saying, “I love knowing how you feel and love that you are able to share yourself with me more after we’re intimate. It makes sex with you even more wonderful.”

Always be you.”
Be confident in yourself and unafraid of testosterone-driven men.

, Look at what he does for you to see how much he loves you. Men will say “I love you”, but as action-oriented people, they show it more often than they say it.Does he do little things around the house for you? Does he run errands to make your day or week a little easier? Instead of penalizing him for not saying it enough, appreciate his actions as his way of saying he loves you.
Touch his cheek gently and look into his eyes as you say, “I know how much you love me because I see everything you do for me without me even having to ask. I love you too.”

, For most women, love means security. Men are sometimes afraid of that security, fearing that with it comes possession and with that, comes a loss of freedom and independence.Show that you love him without control, entrapment, or the fear of losing him.

Be prepared in case he doesn't say ""I love you"" back.",How to Tell a Man You Love Him Without Scaring Him Off1," Before you commit to telling him that you love him get a grip on your true feelings. Have you suddenly become overwhelmed with feelings or has your adoration grown over time? Typically infatuation is something that comes on suddenly, whereas true love builds over time.You should know someone well before you declare your love. If you have been together for at least 3 months and had a couple of arguments, you will have a much better understating of who your man is.
If you have only been dating for a few weeks and everything seems perfect, you may be infatuated and not truly in love.
It is better to keep your feelings to yourself until you are sure that you really do love him.
Telling him that you love him too early in the relationship can really freak him out if he does not feel the same way.;
, Your man may be feeling the same way as you, but has not told you yet. Although he has not said it, his actions may demonstrate how he really feels. Men often show their feelings through their actions instead of their words.Think about your relationship to see if he has been giving you signs. Ask yourself some questions.Does he make you a priority?
Does he mention you when he talks about his future plans and goals?
Have you met the people (e.g. family, friends, coworkers) that are important in his life?
If his actions say that he cares about you, he may not be scared by your strong feelings for him.
Does he speak in terms of ""we"" instead of ""I""?
Does he consistently try to take care of you and keep a smile on your face?
Is he affectionate? Does he want to hug, kiss, and hold hands?
If he acts like he loves you, he probably will not be scared by you expressing your feelings. If his actions do not say that he may be in love with you, you should probably hold off on telling him.

, You should only say ""I love you"" if you truly mean it. You should not say it to feel more secure in your relationship or to hear him say the words back to you.Never use those words to manipulate him, keep him around, or fix a mistake that you made.The best reason to say ""I love you"" is that you simply cannot keep it to yourself any longer, and you want him to know how you feel.
Saying ""I love you"" can change your relationship. Be sure that you are ready for this.

, Although you are ready to say ""I love you,"" your boyfriend may not be ready. This does not mean that he does not care about you or that he will never love you. It only means that he does not feel the same way as you right now. Think about what you will do if he does not say it back to you.If he does not feel the same way, you may feel rejected or uncertain about your relationship.
If you feel that you would be crushed that he does not love you as well, you may want to hold off on telling him.

What are four ways I can show you I love you, in this next week?
What is the most romantic thing I have ever done for you?

, Do not assume that your ideas about what is romantic are his or her ideas about what it means to be romantic. This is a learning process and you may be surprised by what you discover but you will also be better placed to ensure that all future romantic gestures are well targeted.


Be sure you find the right time to bring up such an intimate discussion.

Notice the amount of eye contact.,
Gauge proximity.,
Monitor movement.,
Pay attention to posture.","How to Tell if It's an Acquaintance, Friend, Crush, or Love1"," People’s eyes can be very expressive and tell a lot about how they’re feeling toward those around them.


Friends will make eye contact with each other during conversation to show interest and respect.Someone with a crush on you will make repeated eye contact with you whether in a conversation or not. A crush may hold eye contact for a few seconds, and then look away from shyness, and find your gaze again later.Dilated pupils are another indication of a crush.Someone who’s in love with you will feel totally comfortable locking gazes for extended periods of time.;
, The amount of space people choose to place between themselves and others can be an indicator of their perceived relationships with those around them.


Someone who is your friend will stand or sit closer to you than an acquaintance.A person with a crush on you will stand near you, lean toward you, and look for reasons to get closer to you- whether it’s intentionally walking past you at a close range, or leaning in closer than necessary to talk to you.People who are in love will stand or sit very close together- perhaps their hips touch when standing side by side or their knees touch when sitting across from one another., Our movements, whether conscious or unconscious, can convey lots of different meanings about how we feel about those around us.


Friends will tilt their heads while in conversations with other friends to show that they’re listening. They may touch each other in light, casual ways on the hand or arm.
Someone with a crush will look for reasons to touch the other person, often in a playful and flirty way. They may seem fidgety or nervous, and may subconsciously begin to copy the movements of their crush.Someone who is in love with you will seem very comfortable and secure around you. They may touch you using gentle, caressing gestures.

, The way a person stands (or sits) when they're around you may give you some clues as to how they feel about you.


A friend will stand with his or her shoulders and face pointing toward you. If sitting, he or she will uncross his or her legs to show that he or she is open to you. His or her palms may be open toward you as well, another sign of receptivity.
When someone has a crush on you, they stand tall and slightly stick their chest out. Additionally, they will point their toes and hips toward you, as a sign of wanting to move toward you (both figuratively and literally)."

Choose the right time.,
Say the words.,
Give him space.",How to Tell a Man You Love Him Without Scaring Him Off2," Pick a time when he is relaxed, stress free, and in a good mood. Make sure you two are in a private place where you guys can have an uninterrupted conversation. You do not want someone to walk in or over hear this conversation.


Avoid professing your love after a physically or psychologically charged situation (like before or after being intimate) because he may say that he loves you too due to an adrenaline rush or from being in an emotional environment.Also avoid telling him if either one of you are intoxicated or sleepy. He may or may not remember what you said.
If you discuss future plans for your relationship or how you currently feel, this is the ideal time to tell him that you love him.

, Be as natural as possible and tell him that you love him. Look him in his eyes and say, ""I love you."" You do not have to make it dramatic or awkward, just speak from the heart.


You can choose the ideal situation when you tell him, but try not to think about it too much. If the two of you are alone and having a good time, let him know. Listen to your gut when deciding to say ""I love you."" Avoid saying, ""You are the love of my life."" It causes a comparison between you and his past relationships. He may love you, but may not consider you the love if his life at this point. You may be less likely to get the response you desire if you say that phrase., When you tell him that you love him, let him know that he does not have to say it back to you if he does not feel the same way. You do not want him to feel any pressure when you tell him.


You may say, ""I love you. I understand if you're not ready to say it or you're feelings aren't in the same place as mine. I just wanted you to know how I feel.""
Remember that love happens at different speeds for people. Even if he does not say it back to you, it does not mean that he does not want to be with you.Being patient with him is the best way to allow his love to grow if it is not already there yet.
If your partner does not say ""I love you, too,"" you can use this as an opportunity to ask him where he sees the relationship going."
"
Determine how he likes to receive affection.,
Give him a letter or card.,
Talk to him in person.,
Show him you love him through your actions.",How to Tell a Man You Love Him Without Scaring Him Off3," If you love him, you have probably shared your feelings and other personal information with him before. What settings worked best when you communicated this information. Was it over the phone or a text message? Was it during a romantic date night? Do you two prefer to have more casual, natural conversations?There is no right or wrong way to tell him that you love him.
You are less likely to scare him if you use a method that he is receptive to.

, If you are nervous about talking to him in person, consider giving him a card or a letter that expresses how you feel. This will also give him time to digest what you have said and think about his feelings for you. If you are nervous about telling him or worried that you may clam up during the conversation, this is a good way to tell him.


A card is really helpful if you do not know what to say. You can even choose a more humorous card to keep it light and still get your point across.
You could also find a poem or song that says what you would like to say and rewrite it in your handwriting.

, Telling him face-to-face is the most romantic, yet nerve-racking way. Verbally expressing your true feelings forces you to be vulnerable. Your man may even be more attracted to you when you show him who you really are and how you really feel.If you go this route, practice saying ""I love you"" out loud and in front of a mirror.
You could also make a video that tells him how you feel. You can make sure that you tell him everything that you want to say without getting too nervous. If you mess up, you can always make another video.

, Love is more than a feeling. Your words and actions should match. Before you tell him that you love, your actions should already be saying that you do.


Do something nice like cook him is favorite meal or surprise him with tickets to a movie that he wanted to see.
Be present during good and bad times. While it’s easy to be supportive during happy times, you can really show your love when he’s down in the dumps. Whether he’s had a bad day at work or is dealing with a family health crisis, be his rock and show him you are on his side 24/7.
Support his passions and dreams. From going for a master’s degree to his love of mountain climbing, be his cheerleader. Research his hobbies or goals and bring additional insight to the table.

"
"
Recognize vocal tone.,
Think about how casual your conversations are.,
Notice how much they talk about themselves.,
Analyze how intimate your conversations are.","How to Tell if It's an Acquaintance, Friend, Crush, or Love2"," The inflection and quality of a person’s voice will change subconsciously depending on the feelings they have toward you. Listen to how someone talks in general, and compare it with they sound when talking to you individually.


A friend’s voice will remain constant, with little to no change in pitch or tone.
A crush’s voice will have a playful and flirtatious quality to it. Women use a higher pitch to accentuate their femininity.Men use a lower pitch, but alter the pitch, almost to a “sing-song” tone, to both highlight masculinity, and make a woman feel at ease.People who are in love will alter their voices to match their partners’. Men talk in a higher pitch and women a lower one to show that they are connected as one., A conversation between friends is usually casual and comfortable. Both you and your friend ask and answer questions equally, and may or may not make future plans to hang out.

, If someone has a crush, they will talk a lot about themselves, both from nerves and as a way to “humble-brag.” They will also ask about you, and agree enthusiastically with what you say to make it seem like you have things in common.

, If someone is in love with you, they will open up to you in intimate ways. You may find out about their deep insecurities and fears, childhood, family dynamics, important personal values, and vision for the future. They may plan future vacations, or invite you to meet family.

"
"
Reflect on your relationship.,
Make a list.,
Ask a trusted friend for help.","How to Tell if It's an Acquaintance, Friend, Crush, or Love3"," Take some time in a quiet place simply to think about your feelings toward the person in question, and your interactions with them. Some questions to consider are:


How long have you known this person?
How frequently do you see or talk to them?
Is the communication equitable?
What is the level of intimacy shared (either physically or conversationally)?
How would you characterize your time together? Do you both seem to enjoy being together?

, If you’re trying to determine whether someone is a friend or a crush, make a “Friend/Crush” list. If you’re figuring out whether someone is in love with you, make a “Like/Love” list. Like a Pro/Con list, record any specific behavior that would indicate how they feel about you. Having a visual aid way may give you more insight into how they feel.

, Sometimes our feelings toward someone can cloud our judgment in assessing their behavior. A friend can offer an honest, objective observation of the relationship, and will be less likely to allow personal feelings to affect their understanding.

"
"
Express your feelings first.,
Ask in a tactful, non-threatening way.,
Be prepared for the consequences.","How to Tell if It's an Acquaintance, Friend, Crush, or Love4"," If you’re asking someone to open up to you, then you need to be upfront with them as well. If you’re looking for honesty, you need to show you’re capable of reciprocating. People are more likely to be direct with you if you’re direct with them.


Start with a sentence like, ""I want you to know that I feel____________about you/our relationship. I'm hoping you'll be just as honest and share your feelings about me.""

, Explain that you’re simply trying to gain some insight and clarity in your relationship, and that you respect their feelings no matter what. It’s important for your partner to know that they can open up to you, without an abrasive reaction.


Try saying something like, ""I want you to know that I will completely honor and respect your answer, even if it's not the one I want to hear.""

, There’s a chance you and your partner may be on two different wavelengths in terms of your relationship. Their answer may sting a little. Take some time to decide how you want to proceed in the relationship, knowing exactly how your partner feels about you.

"
"
Be frank.,
Set a clear precedent.,
Ask about STI (sexually-transmitted infection) testing.",How to Talk About Sex1," Lay out your thoughts as plainly as possible. Avoid euphemisms, and try to work past your initial discomfort. It can be embarrassing to talk about sex, but remind yourself that you have nothing to be ashamed about!


Remember that sex is perfectly natural. One might argue that, indeed, nothing is more natural. It is how you came into being.
If you aren't comfortable referring to ""sex,"" try using a similar but ""softer"" phrase. Instead of saying that you are ""having sex,"" say that you are ""making love,"" or ""being intimate,"" or ""getting down."" Each of these phrases has its own set of connotations.;
, If you aren't comfortable doing something, then don't do it. If you let something slide even once, then it will be harder to stop it from happening in the future. Be firm about your expectations, and don't let anyone take advantage of you.

, Before you become intimate with a person, initiate a casual conversation about their sexual health and their testing history. Don't make a big deal about it – just ask if they've been tested recently. Remember that you have the right to look after your own sexual health. You deserve to know if you're about to have sex with someone who might be carrying an infection.Use protection. It never hurts to use a condom, even if a partner has assured you that he or she is STI-free.
This might seem like a small thing, and in the heat of the moment you may be tempted to forego the questions. If you pick up an STI, however, it can plague you for years, and it can have serious health implications. You will need to explain your situation to all future partners.

Stop the negative spiraling.,
Be accepting that you can't make other people into something they are not.,
Be patient.,
Find and make the most of distractions.,
Look for the lesson.,
Keep a lid on the desire to vent.,
Remember that you're not alone.,
Stay involved.,
Relax, there's plenty of time to find love.",How to Stop Being Depressed About Love," There is little point being constantly negative about yourself or your chances in love. This is a bad habit and it deserves to be broken. While it is fine to be down and sad every now and then, it's not fine to have this as your usual temperament.;
, This includes trying to make someone love you; it will happen if it's meant to be but if they change and their love for you also changes, it isn't a good idea to take out their choices on your own self-esteem.

, Love is a very varied ideal and no two people have the same notion of what it is, or is not. This is often the reason behind why love relationships don't always work out because both parties have different viewpoints of what love is and how it should be impacting their lives. In being patient, you can do several important things for yourself:


You can get on with your life and the activities you enjoy
You can cultivate your interests to the greatest extent possible
You can open to all the incredible possibilities that are still awaiting you, including and especially love
You can learn self-patience and apply that to everyday life

, Pursue your hobbies, watch your favorite movies, head outdoors with a trusted friend, etc. When love is getting you down, do something to get on top of the blues. Action is always the best antidote to moping and negativity.

, Being rejected is never pleasant but each time something like that happens to us, there is something we can learn about ourselves, about how relationships develop or fade. Look for what you can take from this to apply to future relationships rather than trying to go over what could have been different. A lot could have been different but hindsight does not changes the past; it only informs the future.

, It's easy to go on and on about a person who has rejected you but, in the end, this merely serves to make you feel a lot worse and word will get around that you whine post-relationships and that might scare people away. By all means have a good vent with a close friend, your mom, or the therapist but be sure whoever you tell will keep it behind closed doors. When explaining to others what happened, keep it light and say simply ""Oh that, yes, well, it didn't work out. We decided to both move on.""

, Most humans will experience love at its best and at its worst as they grow through life. Many people know how hard it is to hurt over a lost love; however, the reality is that people move on. Picking up the pieces, taking the lessons with us, is part and parcel of being human.

, Keep seeing people, keep getting out and doing things. Depression has a habit of keeping a person at home, where it feels worse. Getting out more is a key to moving on.

, It will come, even if you're in your 90s.

Don't share the secret with anyone.,
Treat your secret lover like everyone else while you're in public.,
Avoid having things in writing.,
Have good secret date spots.,
Make up a good story.,
Cover the evidence.,
Don't give out any more information than you need to.,
Have a romance!,
Go over to his house or have him come over to yours.,
Give yourself a pat on the back.",How to Survive Secret Romances," Telling your best friend about your secret little romance may be a good idea at the time, but what happens when your friend accidentally asks you how your boyfriend is while your mom is driving you to school? Telling others (even people who seem trustworthy) about your secret romance will most likely backfire, so keep it to yourself.;
, Don't flirt or look like you want to be with them while you're in public. People will become suspicious that there's something going on, and the gossip mill will start. Treat your secret lover like another random person out there. Don't avoid them like crazy, as this will cause suspicion as well. Just treat them normally.

, Avoid texting or emailing each other romantic notes, or posting cute things on each others' Facebook profile. You never know who could be reading over your secret lover's shoulder, or if their parents go through the texts on their cell phones. Things are easier to deny when they're not in writing.

, When going out, don't go to the local coffee shop, or the mall that your friends frequent. Go somewhere far away that nobody you know would be. There's always a chance that you'll see someone that you know (it's a small world), but lessen the chances as much as you can.

, If your parents ask you where you're going as you're heading out the door to meet your secret lover, don't stand there and stammer out a pathetic excuse. Have a good cover-up story planned out beforehand, in case anyone asks you where you're going or what you're doing. Say that you're going to the library, somewhere to study, the spa, a friend's house, etc. If someone asks to go with you, don't let them. Tell them that you need quiet so that you can concentrate, or that you want a little time to yourself, etc.

, Don't leave any evidence of your secret romance, whether it's misplaced underwear, an undeleted text message, or a lipstick mark on your cheek. Don't come home with messed-up hair, your face covered in lipstick, and without one shoe. Look the exact same way you did when you left, and cover up any evidence that you two were together.

, If one of your friends asks you, ""Have you met _____?"" Just say ""Yes"". Don't say, ""Oh yeah, we're great friends."" or ""I know him really well!"" Don't give out more information than you're asked. This is important!

, Don't get so caught up with keeping the romance a secret that you forget to have a romance! Go out, kiss, hug, etc.

, Find a private place to talk, or wait until your parents/family aren't home. Be romantic! Don't be afraid to do some hugging, snuggling, and cozying up! Snuggle up to him really close and tilt your head up. If he is in the moment, the kiss will naturally come. Don't try to kiss him, let him kiss you. If the kiss happens, focus on making it a memorable kiss. When getting cozy, be sweet but assertive; don't be afraid to say no.

, You're surviving your secret romance! Congratulations! But remember, if you are in the middle of a secret romance, future dates are hard. Call him; follow up on first date with a phone call, invite him to go to a place (mall, movies, park, your/his house, amusement park, etc.), and with luck, no one will suspect your romance.

Be communicative.,
Stay on the same page.,
Make it a dialogue.,
Talk about sex when you're not having sex.",How to Talk About Sex2," Ask for what you want. Be vocal about what you like, and don't be afraid to speak up when something doesn't work for you. If you aren't clear about your needs, then your partner won't know how to meet those needs.


Be as frank and open as possible. Cultivate a relationship that is build around clear communication. The more you talk about this, the easier it will be!
If you want more sex, don't be afraid to say so. Do not demand it or expect it. Explain why you don't feel that you're getting enough, and try to find a solution that the two of you can agree upon., Make sure that you and your partner have a mutual understanding about the rules and expectations of the relationship. A relationship is a mutual understanding, and it is your responsibility to maintain that understanding. Define the sort of relationship that you want, and make the relationship itself an act of discussing that balance.Talk about when and where it's okay to have sex. Remember that it's okay for your preferences to change over time. Remember also, however, that the onus falls upon you to keep your partner up-to-date with these changing preferences.
Decide whether you are exclusive. If not, make sure that you agree about who each of you can and cannot have sex with. Be clear and be truthful. If you leave this part murky, then you could damage your relationship and seriously hurt someone.

, Each of you should feel equally empowered to negotiate the terms of the conversation. Someone will probably need to initiate the conversation, and that person may well be you – but you can still create space for your partner to speak his or her mind. Listen. Be patient.


Avoid accusatory ""you"" statements like, ""You never want to have sex anymore!"" Instead, focus on the way that things make you feel, or try to remain objective. Say, ""I feel that our sex drives have been unbalanced lately,"" or ""I want to open up a dialogue about the way that our sex life has been lately.""Again: a relationship is a mutual understanding. A healthy sex life is built upon communication. Don't let one person make all of the moves!

, This can be a great way to get comfortable discussing intimacy with your partner. Bring it up when you both have free time to talk. Check in to see that you're on the same page, and that the current arrangement is working for both of you. Be unabashed and matter-of-fact about this sort of communication. If you don't act like it's weird, then it won't be weird."

Know when it's time to talk to your child about sex.,
Bring it up gently.,
Use outside resources.",How to Talk About Sex3," The ""right time"" means something different for every kid and every parent. As a general rule of thumb, consider that your child should probably know how to practice safe, consensual sex by the time that he or she winds up in a sexual situation. If your child is approaching his or her teen years, then hormones are coming, and the time is nigh.


Consider that in this digital age, more and more children are learning about sex from the Internet. If your child gets curious, then he or she may do a lot of exploratory searching. This is not to say that you should try to stifle this curiosity – but you can certainly use your knowledge to act as a guiding figure. Your child may know more than you think.
Many schools incorporate some form of sexual education into their curriculum. Try using this as a reason to engage with your kids about the realities of sex. Set yourself up as a resource, and offer to answer any questions that your children might have.

, Sex can be an embarrassing topic for adults to discuss – let alone children or teenagers! If the topic comes up naturally, then take the opportunity to discuss it. Otherwise: plan out what you are going to say, and try to build upon what your child already knows. Keep an open mind.Be respectful of boundaries. If your son or daughter doesn't want to talk about the ""birds and the bees,"" then don't force the conversation.

, There are various books, websites, and other resources available that make it easier for kids and teenagers to learn about healthy sex. If your child is younger than 10-12, consider going through these resources one-on-one. If you are dealing with a teenager, then you can likely just pass along the information and let your teen explore on his/her own time.What Makes A Baby by Cory Silverberg is a children's book for parents looking to explain to young children how babies are conceived and born. If you're unsure how to word the discussion in a kid-friendly manner, this can be an excellent resource.
The website BishUK provides a range of topics for parents and teens. The site covers not only the physical aspects of sex, but its emotional impact.
MTV, as an offshoot of their Teen Mom series, runs the website . The information on the site helps teenagers understand sex and sexuality, and it can help teach young adults how to make safe decisions regarding their bodies.
Speakeasy, a Family Planning Association, features online guides to help parents talk to kids about sex and reproduction. There are guides available for a variety of ages.

Get in touch with her only when you have something to say.,

Go for some Skype or Face Time.,
Write her a letter.,
Get in touch on Facebook.,
Send her flowers.,
Send her cookies.,
Send her a CD mix.,
Send her a postcard.,
Send her something from your location.,
Plan a weekend date.,
Make a special trip to see her.,
Take the pressure off and arrange a group hang out.,
Find a visiting schedule that works for you.",How to Stay in Touch with a Girl You Like," This may sound harsh, but it's important to make sure you get in touch with her only when you want to tell her something, whether it's that you miss her or that you saw a movie that made you think of her. Don't just get in touch by saying Sup? and wait for her to come up with something to say. Tell her something sweet, something she hasn't heard before, or something that makes her laugh.


You may be tempted to text or call her all day long. But that will quickly get annoying. It's better to get in touch only every few days with something awesome than to turn your contact into a boring routine.
Don't text her and say, I'm bored... She shouldn't think that you're getting in touch just because you have nothing better to do.;
, Texting may be one of your main forms of communication, so it's important that you get it right. Send her texts that say you miss her, that you're thinking about her, and that you're wondering what she's up to. If you saw something that made you laugh, let her know; be witty, not boring. If you just say, ""How's life?"" you're not likely to start an interesting textual exchange. Tell her something she hasn't heard before.


You can engage in a pretty long convo as long as it's interesting, but you should always leave her wanting more.

, Call her at least once a week to see how she's doing. Don't just call to check in if you have nothing to say for yourself. Make sure to have at least one or two interesting stories to tell and be prepared to ask her a few questions. Tell her that you miss her, that you miss hearing her voice, and that you wish it would be easier to see her. Keep things fun and casual, though, while letting her know she's important to you.


Don't make your calls mopey or sad because you miss her. Remind her of how much fun it is to be around you.
Take turns calling each other first. You don't want to be the guy who always initiates the conversation.

, If you're into sending emails as a way of staying in touch, then make them count. Don't just email her once a day with what you think is a hilarious link to College Humor. Send her one email every week or two that makes her laugh, is filled with witty observations, and which actually shows that you care about how things are going for her. Keep it to just two or three paragraphs and make them count. If you see a link to an interesting article or to a music video you know she'll love, then send that along, too.


Make sure to write back to her in a timely manner. Don't respond ASAP or you'll look desperate, but don't leave her hanging for more than two or three days.

, Though nothing can be as good as seeing her in person, you should plan to have weekly or monthly Skype or Face Time dates so you can at least see each other face-to-face (sort of). Being able to see each other's faces and expressions as you talk is different from just talking on the phone or texting. Make it a ritual.


Maybe every Sunday, you both drink tea and Skype each other at three o'clock; maybe you Skype each other at the end of your school days. Find a time that makes you feel most energized and excited to see each other.

, Don't think that letters are out of style. You may be writing the girl the first letter she ever received! (Unless she spent some time at sleep-away camp.) It's not corny or silly if you do it the right way -- and it's a great thing to do when you can't just call the girl up because she's in another country or can't be reached by phone for another reason.


Keep it sweet and simple. Tell her you miss her and tell her about something that made you think of her.
Give her a few details about what is going on in your life, but keep things interesting. Don't tell her that you're just sitting around pining away and being bored at home; tell her a funny anecdote about your work, school, or family.
Make sure to ask some questions. How else will you get an answer? Ask her how she's doing, what her days have looked like, and how her friends are. Be as specific as you can; saying ""How have you been?"" is more vague than asking, ""How was your trip to see your grandmother?"" or ""How are soccer tryouts going?""
Sign your letter with Love or Thinking of You. This doesn't mean you're saying I love you -- it just means that the girl is important to you.
And hey, if you're feeling really confident in your relationship, write her a good old fashioned love letter.

, You should only use Facebook to supplement more meaningful contact. You probably have hundreds of Facebook friends, so talking to the girl on Facebook won't make her feel too special. Still, there are some small things you can do to let her know she's on your mind, like liking her photos or comments when they pop up on your News Feed (without overdoing it, of course), or posting a link that made you think of her on her wall.


You can also chat her on Facebook from time to time, but don't make yourself too accessible. Keep up some of the mystery of your relationship. If she knows you won't be on Facebook all the time, she'll be more excited when she does see your name pop up in her chat box.

, This simple yet effective move is guaranteed to make her smile. Whether it's Valentine's Day, her birthday, or even a day during a random week when you know she's feeling a bit blue, then making the gesture to send her some flowers along with a short note will make her see that she really means something to you. Ideally, knowing which flowers she likes the most is better than sending her a generic bouquet or flowers; see if you can find out her favorite type of flower without being too obvious.


Keep it a surprise. Don't let her know they're coming (though you should make sure she'll be home to accept the delivery).

, What, you're too manly to bake some cookies, package them properly, and send them to your special lady's address? Pish posh. If you want to go out of your way to impress the girl and show off your culinary skills, then make some simple chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin cookies and send 'em her way. Or if your mom or sister has made another batch of her famous cookies, send several of them to your special girl.


Really: she'll be impressed that you think she's so special that you want to share your favorite sweets with her.
It goes without saying that you should only mail them to her when you know she'll be home. You should wait for the cookies to cool down and then send them off as soon as you can after that.

, This is even more romantic than going into a store and buying a CD for the girl. Make a compilation of all of your favorite tunes, making sure that they are songs that she actually likes. If you love Metallica but are pretty sure that's not her thing, you can keep it off the list. If there are any special songs that make you think of each other, then you can add those to the mix. You can write Katie's ultimate mix or something short to remind her of you.


You don't have to pick something overly sappy or sentimental. Pick something that puts her in a fun frame of mind and makes her think of you.

, If you've been traveling, send her a cute and short postcard with a picture of where you've been and say that you've been thinking of her. Just drop her a few lines about some of the fun stuff you've been doing without making her feel left out and drop a quick, ""You'd love it here!"" or something that would make her feel like she's still on your mind no matter how far away you are.


If you want to be cute, you can send her a postcard even if you haven't gone anywhere. Send her a postcard from your hometown and say, ""I love it here!"" It'll make her laugh and will score you major originality points.

, If you're spending the summer in Florida, send her a few shells you found on the beach. If you're backpacking in Europe, send her a small souvenir from the city where you stopped. If you're just spending the summer at your grandmother's apple orchard, send her a bushel of apples that aren't fully ripe yet. Do something to give her a sense of place and to think about you in another location.


The ultimate goal is always to have the girl both thinking of you, thinking you're thoughtful, and wanting to be where you are.

, You and the girl can only stay apart for so long. Unless you're living on opposite sides of the country, in different countries, or it's just not possible for you guys to meet up, you should try to plan a meet-up on a weekend after you have talked enough and feel comfortable enough to take your relationship to the next level. It could be a low-pressure meet up at first and you don't have to plan anything big and romantic -- just making the contact is the important part.


That being said, you should still make the girl feel special when you do meet up. Give her flowers, a hug, a compliment, or something that reminded you of her when you see her.

, Maybe it's not super convenient for the two of you to just meet up for a weekend. If you really like the girl and the feeling is mutual, though, then you have to make sure to see her at some point if you don't want her interest to drop. Making an effort to see the girl even if she's far away or if it's pricey impractical to see her is part of what will make it so romantic. Even if you're not just living in neighboring towns or even states, have a conversation about going to see her if you really want to make it work.


The surprise trip may not be the best idea. Unless you're really sure she wants to see you, don't just show up in her hometown unannounced. You have no way of knowing exactly what's going on with her.

, If you really like the girl but are too shy to arrange a solo meet-up or don't want to put too much pressure on the relationship, then suggest hanging out in a group. If you have the same group of friends, like if you met in summer camp, then great. Suggest a little reunion. If you don't have any of the same friends, then have a barbecue or a small gathering at your place.


Tell her it would be great to see her, but don't make it sound like you're really doing all of this just to see her, even if you are.

, If you've met up with the girl in person and it went well, then make sure months don't go by without you seeing each other gain. How often you see each other depends on how serious your relationship is and what you really want from each other. If it's practical, try to see each other once a month at least, during every holiday, or even every two or three months if that works better.


If you really want to stay in touch with her, then try to plan your next visit shortly after you see her, when you're both feeling a contact high and want to make things work. You can both get busy if too much time goes by, and it won't be as easy to remember how much you love hanging out with each other.

""Mmmmmm""
""Ohhhhh""
""Yes""

You won't be an expert instantly, so you'll need to give your partner and yourself time to discuss your turn-ons and turn-offs. The best time to talk about these is right after sex, when both of you are relaxed and want to be close., If you are feeling the urge, just whisper to your partner during sex, ""talk dirty to me.""

There is also a chance that your partner is turned on by this invitation and could really move things forward., Many couples will initiate foreplay with speaking dirty to one another.

, Increasing the volume at which you breathe or sigh, will help your intimacy become more vocal., You can communicate a lot to your partner by softly biting your lip. Body language can get points across in the bedroom, even if you're not trying to reveal something.Careful if you are prone to holding in your emotions because they'll come out through your body language.This is why it's important to be aware of your body language before sex and use it to your advantage during sex.

One study found that 14% of men and 10% of women had not had sexual intercourse in the preceding year. There are many changes and transitions in life that can lead to celibacy – involuntary or not.Resist the urge to judge yourself harshly for being celibate. Ignore what you think society says about where you should be in your lifespan and whether you should be having sex, dating, married or with children. Your opinion of yourself is the most important one. The depression that can occur from celibacy can unfortunately prevent you from moving forward.;
, If you feel socially awkward or shy, you may have trouble meeting people. The most significant barrier to finding a sexual partner is shyness.A general lack of social skills can also impede you from finding a sexual partner.Work on improving your social skills so that you feel more comfortable meeting new people.


Work on your nonverbal communication. Your body language communicates certain messages to other people. If you stand away from a crowd, or you hunch your shoulders a lot, you may be nonverbally telling others to stay away from you. Try standing up straight with your shoulders back and your head held high. Stand closer to a group of people and listen with interest to their conversation.Have a mental list of general conversation topics. If you find that you run out of things to say, you can prepare ahead of time with some general ideas about things to talk about. This can include the weather, your work or school, a recent movie, a hike you went on, and so on.Practice your social skills with all kinds of people. You don’t need to save your social skills for potential partners. Try them out on the mail carrier or the grocery store clerk.

, Making your dive back to sexual activity pleasurable will build your confidence. Feeling self-conscious or embarrassed of your body can make sex needlessly uncomfortable. If you struggle with body image issues that are negatively affecting your sex life, then make it a priority to rectify what you can and accept what you cannot.


Join a gym to get some exercise. You don’t need to have a goal of losing 15 pounds, but the very action of getting some physical exercise can improve your confidence.It can also improve your sex life by boosting your energy.
Treat yourself to a new haircut or new underwear. Feeling sexy will help you remember what you like about sex and get you excited for the activity again.

, Address your life circumstances that may be holding you back and reducing your confidence. Whether the obstacle is where you live or other circumstances, take the steps to address that obstacle.You may be in a living situation where you don’t have a lot of privacy. You might live with a roommate or a family member. If you want to pursue a physical relationship with a partner, figure out ways to ensure you get the privacy you need. See if your roommate will go out for one or two evenings every week, for example.


You might consider getting your own place if your living situation isn’t allowing you enough privacy.

, Ensure you’re in fine form to have sex. Schedule a physical examination with your doctor. This can be especially helpful if you stopped having sex for health reasons, for example.If you’ve had a baby recently, you will want to see your gynecologist to get a green light for sex. Many women who have given birth find sex to be uncomfortable or painful after childbirth.Your doctor can determine if there are any physical problems resulting from childbirth.

, Perhaps you stopped having sex because things weren’t working properly for you. For example, maybe you weren’t having orgasms anymore. This doesn’t mean that you have to stop having sex entirely. There are many options for medications and other treatments for sexual dysfunction, both for men and women.


Be proactive about addressing dysfunction that you’re experiencing. Make an appointment with your doctor. He or she will be able to help you figure out the next step.
You may feel shy or embarrassed when talking to your doctor about issues pertaining to sex. But your doctor is there to help you live your life to the fullest and genuinely wants to help you. It might help talking with a female doctor if you’re a woman, or a male doctor if you’re a man.

, Your mental health can affect how you respond to sex. If you are depressed, you might have decreased interest in sex.Address your depression or anxiety by seeing a counselor. This person will be able to help you dig into why you feel depressed or anxious. He or she can also give you strategies for coping with these disorders. Some signs of depression can include:


Significant loss of appetite or loss of weight.
Disrupted sleep (either unable to sleep or sleeping too much).
Fatigue or loss of energy.
Increased agitation or decreased movement noticeable by others.
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive.
Having difficulty concentrating or feeling.
Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, attempting suicide or having a plan for suicide.
Talk with your doctor about medication. Depression and anxiety can be caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Medications help correct those imbalances. Be warned, however, that some medications may reduce sexual interest or pleasure. Talk with your doctor to find the best option for you.

, If you’re having trouble meeting someone that you connect with, you might need to widen your circle of potential partners. Online dating sites are great places to find other people looking for relationships. This type of dating is much more common than it used to be, and chances are you’ll meet a wider range of people than you would in your everyday in-person life., If you’re in a long-term relationship and the spark has fizzled, you might need to reconnect with your partner so that you start having sex again. Rediscover the affection and attraction that drew you two together in the first place.


Relive good memories. Revisit some of the places you went for dates when your relationship was new. Try some of the old restaurants or visit the beach where you used to have makeout sessions.
Overcome anger in your relationship by talking with each other. The relationship might be suffering because one or both of you are angry or resentful. It might take a while to get back to the good relationship, but talking about your problems is a good first step. You might think about visiting a marriage counselor.
Make sex a priority in your relationship. You might have to schedule time for it, especially if you have kids. Plan a date night, send the kids to the grandparents’ house, and have a fun time together.

, When it comes to flirting, there are different styles of communication that have varied results. Flirtation styles include physical, sincere, polite, traditional, and playful.You will likely find more success with flirting and dating adopting a physical, sincere, and playful style rather than being especially polite or traditional. Also, the physical and sincere styles are even more conducive specifically for sexual activity.Physical flirting is where individuals show interest through physical touch, like touching someone’s shoulder.
Sincere flirting style is contingent on creating an emotional bond, and involves more self-disclosure than other styles, but also is non-sexual.Polite flirters are not comfortable being overtly sexual, and rigidly follow traditional courtship rules.Traditional flirting styles involve when men take the lead and are the aggressor.Playful flirters treat flirtation like a game, indiscriminately and openly showing their affection and regard for others.If you have a long-term partner with whom you want to re-initiate sex, try flirting with him or her. Ignite the passion in your relationship that you have had in the past.

, When speaking with someone you are interested in, use assertive communication. Express your thoughts and feelings directly using “I” messages, such as, “I think you’re really cute.”If you have hit a ""dry spell"" in your long-term relationship, you might say to your partner: ""I've noticed we haven't had sex in a long time, and I'd like to talk about it.""


Even when speaking directly, be sure that both people are taking turns in the conversations.Give the person a chance to speak by allowing for brief silences (usually a few seconds).If you are worried about your social skills, there are general expectations for how you should communicate. You should strive to be informative, relevant, truthful, polite, and modest., Don’t expect that you’ll have sex right away with a new partner. It’s better to get to know the person and take the relationship slowly. Then you will feel more comfortable with progressing to the next step.

, You can also make it a point to get to know your own body in a sexual way. Women who masturbate have significantly more sexual satisfaction than those who do not.Integrating sexual materials like vibrators and lube in your sex life can improve your satisfaction.These are tools that you can use alone or with a partner. If you’re shy about starting to use a vibrator or other sex toy with a partner, try it out by yourself first.

, In most U.S. states, the age at which you can have consensual sex is 18. Know that if your partner is under the age of consent and you are above it, you could be charged with statutory rape. Consensual sex also means that both partners are willing to participate. When having sex, both you and your partner can say no and withdraw consent at any time. If at any point someone says “no,” stop immediately.


Remember that just because someone doesn't say ""no"" doesn't mean that they are comfortable with the situation. Consent is an ongoing process.

, Unprotected sexual activity can lead to unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Fortunately, condoms are a great way to prevent these issues. Use a condom every time you have sex, and for the complete act.Pregnancy: Be aware that hormone birth control will only protect against pregnancy, not sexually transmitted infections. It’s best to have two ways to protect yourself, such as using both hormonal birth control and condoms. Use condoms according to their directions; condoms are only 82% effective against pregnancy with typical use (this equals 18 pregnancies out of 100 per year). The birth control pill is only 91% effective, with 9 pregnancies occurring out of 100 women per year.The most effective method to prevent pregnancy is the birth control implant, with fewer than one pregnancy per 100 women.
Sexually transmitted infections: Always use a condom correctly during sex.. Also, an HPV vaccine like Gardasil and Cervarix can prevent HPV, the virus that causes genital warts and cervical, anal, penile, vaginal, and oral cancers.. Talk to your doctor and support system about vaccination options.

, Dental dams, personal lubrication products, and other supplies can significantly improve sexual satisfaction. It can be especially helpful if you haven’t had sex in a long time and you’re concerned about discomfort for you or your partner.Dental dams: A dental dam is a thin latex sheet that is placed in the mouth to provide protection during oral sex. Try finding them online or at a sexual health store. Some drug stores do carry them, but they are not as commonly found as other forms of sexual protection.Personal lubricants: There are three kinds of lubricants, which include water-based, silicone-based, and oil-based, and all of these have different features.

Water-based lubricants: These are convenient because they rinse off easily and are easy to purchase in most stores.They can be used safely with condoms and can even prevent the condom from breaking.This type of lubricant also is associated with fewer genital symptoms than silicone-based lubricants.Silicone-based lubricants: These have the advantage of lasting longer than other lubricants. They are also the best choice for anal sex.Oil-based lubricants: These should never be used with latex condoms. Oil-based lubricants, or using oil as a lubricant, can cause the condom to break., People who can talk about sex have better sex lives.Be assertive with your partner about your needs.This communication is also important if you are talking to your friends. People who can talk about sex socially are more likely to be able to discuss safe sex with their partners.Don’t be afraid to let your partner in on details about your attitudes and feelings toward sex.Tell your partner what feels good to you.Frame requests in a positive way, such as, ""I like when you touch me there."" And don’t be afraid to ask what your partner wants and what he or she likes, too.

, Your sexual relationship will be more exciting if you engage in foreplay well before you actually have sex. Physical touching, smiling, laughing and other activities make both of you feel loved, safe and aroused.


Try giving each other massages, hugs and kisses even when you’re not having sex.
Send a sexy text to your partner.

Know which couch-snuggling poses to avoid.",How to Snuggle With a Girl1," If you want to initiate a snuggle session, you have to make your girl want to get all cuddly with you. There are a few ways for your body to say, ""It's snuggle time,"" without you having to be too obvious about it. Once you show her you're ready and that your body is the perfect snuggle tool, she'll come closer. Sit down on the couch first, and let her know what you want. Here's how to show her:


Keep your body open. Your arms should be out and your legs should be a little bit apart. Make yourself look bigger than you really are. Expand the snuggle territory.
Bonus points if you drape a blanket around yourself or put it on your lap. Women love blankets, and the blanket will draw her near you. If you want, you can even set the temperature a little colder than usual so she'll want your body heat, and the heat of the blanket.
Dim the lights. Whether you're watching a movie or just hanging out, nobody want to snuggle with all the lights on.
Make sure to have showered and to look your best. If you just came straight from the gym, she won't be too excited about snuggling with you.;
, Smile and make eye contact when she sits next to you. Without saying anything, let her know you think she looks amazing and you want to get closer. Don't be too obvious about it. Even if your heart is jumping, play it cool.


Once she joins you, scoot just a little bit closer to her without being too obvious about it.

, You can slowly do this before she joins you, or even do it once she sits next to you. Just avoid the corny ""I'm pretending to yawn but really just awkwardly putting my arm around you"" move.


Remember, your arm should go around the couch, not around the girl. If you put your arm firmly around the girl, she may feel stuck where she is and won't be open to more snuggling.

, First, put your other hand on her knee and lightly caress it. If she's receptive, you can start holding her hand, and playing with her fingers. As you do this, continue to subtly move closer together.


This should feel natural because both of you are moving toward each other. If she's not into it, you'll know because she won't want you to touch her hand or her knee. But if all goes according to plan, you should be moving closer together, so that your knees are almost touching.

, Now it's time to put old ""couch arm"" to work. Once you're caressing your girl with one hand and put the other arm around her, you will be in full-out snuggle mode. But you have to be subtle when you put your other arm around her, or she may be startled by your abruptness. Here's what to do:


Continue to caress her with your other hand. This will keep her occupied, and will make it easier for you to put your arm around her without her even realizing it.
Gently stroke her hair with the arm that was around the couch. Lower the arm until you've stroked her hair a few times.
Then, put your arm around her. You've done it!

, If everything goes according to plan, your girl will love your snuggle moves, and will want to keep things going. Now that you've got your arms both wrapped around her, you should be so close together that your knees are touching.


Wait for her to put her head on your chest or the crook of your arm.
Stroke her shoulder with the arm that was around her shoulder.
Give her a light kiss on the top of the forehead. Girls love this move if it's done correctly.
Remember to keep active. You don't have to be caressing the girl every second and it's good to take some to stay still, but ever so often, you should still caress her arm or stroke her hair so you don't feel so locked in.

, If you like where your cuddle session is going, you can tilt your body until your head is resting on the side of the couch, and your legs are still near the ground but turned toward the other side of the couch. She'll still have her head on your chest, and if you both move correctly, you'll be snuggling with her lying on you.


Your bodies won't be facing the exact same direction. Don't lie completely on the couch with her body exactly over yours or that will feel awkward. Just shift your body so you're more in the reclined position so she can drape her body across the couch while still snuggling with you, or even using you as her snuggle pillow.

, If your snuggle session is going strong, you can try mixing things up so the same old pose doesn't get old. Whether you're sitting up and getting close, or if she's reclined with her head on your chest, you can expand your snuggling repertoire with these easy moves:


The sitting spoon. In this classic move, you're both sitting up with your arms around each other, but your girl's legs are folded and turned towards you, so her legs fit onto your lap, and your legs fit below hers.
The ""Mama Bear Spoon."" In this variation of the spoon, your girl will be curled behind you while putting her arms around you.
The ""Papa Bear Spoon."" In this version, you're still spooning with your girl curled up behind you, but this time, you've put your arms around her.

, Though snuggling on the couch is a perfect way to get closer to your girl, there are a few awkward poses that can lead to you getting too close, or just feeling weird. When you expand your cuddling moves, make sure to avoid these poses at all costs:


The dead arm. This is the most common snuggling faux pas. When you're snuggling while you're sitting up, don't spread your arm out in front of your girl's extended arm, so her arm is caught behind you and you've cut off her circulation.
The face-to-face cuddle. Unless you're having a make-out session or are dying to let your girl smell whatever you had for dinner, don't cuddle sitting up while your faces are pointed toward each other.
The tight squeeze. You may love snuggling with your girl, but don't squeeze her so tightly that she can't breathe. That is not what people mean when they tell you that you should ""take her breath away"" with your moves.
The human knot. If you and your girl are so entwined that it would take an hour just to find out where the heck you've placed your arm, then you are committing a cuddling crime.

Get close.,
Caress your girl.,
Once you're in snuggle mode, try a few classic snuggling poses.,
Always remember to avoid the ""dead arm.""",How to Snuggle With a Girl2," The first step to snuggling in bed is getting your body close to your girl's. If you're already in bed together, then things must be pretty intimate between you, whether you're waking up in the morning together, are just taking a little nap, or even if you just got it on. Whatever your reason for being in bed together, it's time to get as close as you can. Here's how to do it:


First, subtly move closer until your bodies are touching.
Then, put your arm around her. This works whether she's facing you, looking up, or even turned in the other direction.

, Now that you've gotten closer, it's time to caress your lady so she wants more of your super snuggling skills. There are a variety of ways to get her into the snuggling mood. Here are a few:


Try some gentle kisses. If you're already in bed together, it's pretty likely that you've locked lips, so this shouldn't throw her off her game. But don't kiss on the lips, because that may lead things in a different direction. Kiss her on the top of her forehead or her cheek. If you're feeling bold, you can even lift her hand to your mouth and kiss it, or even kiss her on the shoulders.
Stroke her shoulders and her hair.
Stroke the small of her back.

, Once your bodies are close and you've eased your girl with some gentle caresses, you can experiment with a few different poses to see what snuggle style suits you best. Here are some things to try:


The spoon. This is a classic. Take turns with one of you being big spoon and the other being little spoon.
Try the star gazer. Have your girl put her head on the fleshy part of your chest, and snuggle up at your side. Put your arm around her while she gazes out.
Face each other. Put your girl's head into your chest and wrap your arms around her. Put your chin on her forehead.

, The ""dead arm"" is the worst thing that can go wrong during snuggling session in your bed. But worry not — you and your girl will be able to avoid ""dead arm"" with just a few easy tricks. Here's what you can do:


Do the superman. Get in big spoon mode, but instead of putting your bottom arm around her, hang it up over her head or straight out. You may have to scoot down a little lower in the bed so there's room for your arm.
Do the shoulder roll. While you're snuggling, turn your chest closer to the bed so you can easily roll the arm that was supposed to be under your girl behind you.

Disconnect.",How to Spice Things Up in the Bedroom1," Spend some time and money on transforming your bedroom into an escape from the outside world. Making your bedroom feel like a hotel room can help you escape your everyday life and move into a more satisfying love life.Put noise-cancelling curtains on your windows and soft, luxurious blankets on your bed.
If you have any pets, be sure that they are out of the room during your intimate encounters. It can really kill the mood if your dog jumps up on the bed and decides that it wants kisses, too.;
, On average, people with silk sheets have more intimate encounters per week than those with duvets., Studies have shown that people who have purple bedding or furniture in their bedroom have more intimate encounters each week than those who do not.Other colors that did well in the study were red, sky blue, pink, and black.
Colors to avoid include grey, green, and beige., Pillows can be used in a number of ways to enhance intimate positions.Make sure that you have lots of comfy pillows on your bed!

, Couples are more likely to get intimate in a warm bedroom, where being scantily clad (or naked) feels comfortable. That said, a bedroom that’s too hot makes it difficult for both parties to perform.Aim for a temperature between 68 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on your tastes., Sheets that smell like sweat (and lord knows what else) are less sexy than clean-smelling sheets. Be sure to keep your sheets clean and smelling nice by washing them regularly.You might also want to spray your sheets with a linen spray to keep them smelling good. If you do this, make sure you don’t go overboard — an overpowering scent will be off-putting.

, Ensure that dirty laundry is in a hamper and that there are no other reminders of your household chores within eyesight when you’re getting intimate. Seeing reminders of your chores can be distracting and stress-inducing., Condoms, toys, props, lubricant — put anything that you are likely to use during intimate encounters into a box or drawer that is meant only for those things.


That way, when you’re making out, you don’t end up digging around or searching for things when you need them., Music and physical intimacy go well together — as one expert says, the two tap into a primitive part of our brains.

Recommended tunes are ones with a sexy beat that evokes a wave-like feeling, but really anything that gets you going is fine!, Candles do more than set the mood: their flattering light will boost your physical appearance. Avoid choosing candles that are too heavily scented, as these can be off-putting.To be safe, stick to unscented candles.
If you really want to use scented candles, try one of these scents: pumpkin pie, licorice, lavender, cinnamon buns, or cucumber. Avoid cherry, cranberry, chocolate, and smokey scents., Instead of turning your attention to the TV, smart phone or tablet when you retire for the evening, make an effort to be together in bed — to cuddle and unwind together. Doing this will make intimate encounters more likely.Resist the urge to check your phone while being intimate with someone. A study showed that 1 in 10 people do this. If you’re one of those people, remove the temptation by leaving your phone on silent in the other room."

Invite a pet to come and join you.",How to Snuggle," One of the first things you need to consider when preparing to snuggle is your personal hygiene. No one wants to snuggle with someone who hasn't showered in three days.


Make yourself snuggle-able by having a hot shower before your boyfriend or girlfriend arrives. Wash your hair with a scented shampoo and de-fuzz anything that needs to be defuzzed!
Apply some deodorant and place a little perfume or aftershave on your pulse points, such as behind your ears, on your inner wrists, in the crook of your elbows and at the base of your throat. Remember not to overdo the application of perfume or cologne, however; this can be a complete turn off if the smell is too strong!
Also remember to brush your teeth and rinse your mouth out with mouth wash. Snuggling often leads to kissing!;
, The second thing you need to do is set the mood for some intimate snuggling.


Try to get as much privacy as possible -- make sure any parents/siblings/friends/roommates are out of the house, or at least make them promise that they'll stay out of the room.
Dim the lights. Turning off the main light in the room and using a few lamps instead can make the atmosphere much more romantic and suitable for snuggling. Try lighting a few scented candles if you really want to kick the romance levels up a notch.
Make sure the room is comfortably warm, but not too hot. You don't want your date to be shivering, but you don't want them to be too hot to get close to you either. With that said, lighting a small fire can be uber romantic.

, Comfort is of paramount importance when it comes to snuggling, so make sure you and your date won't be sitting on the floor.


Choose a snuggling location with a comfortable couch, love seat, or bed. Pile on plenty of pillows or cushions -- these can be useful when there's an awkward elbow or hip bone getting in the way of a good snuggle.
Get a warm blanket (that's big enough to cover the two of you) and drape it over the back of the couch. Then you'll easily be able to grab it once a good snuggling position has been established. Make sure it's soft, not scratchy like some wool blankets.

, Once your date arrives, steer him/her gently towards your chosen snuggle location and ask him/her to sit down.


Ask him/her if he'd/she'd like a drink or something to eat -- you want to make sure all of his/her needs are taken care of in advance so that something as silly as ""needing a glass of water"" won't disrupt your snuggling later on.
Tell him/her he's/she's welcome to take his/her shoes off and snuggle up under the blanket -- you want him/her to be as comfortable as possible.
Start the movie or TV show or game or whatever other activity you had planned for the evening.

, Sit down next to your date -- as close as you feel comfortable with -- so you can set the snuggle plan in motion.


Try resting your arm on the back of the couch behind your date's head (this works well for guys, it may feel somewhat unnatural for girls). The when you've built up the courage, you can transfer your arm to your date's shoulder.
Try grabbing your date's hand. You can just hold it or you can play with it, stroking the individual fingers and massaging the palm.
You could start playing with your date's hair (guy or girl), twisting it around or stroking it (without pulling). Alternatively, you could try massaging his/her neck or tugging gently on his/her earlobe.
Really, it doesn't matter what you do as long as you are touching your date -- the point is to initiate physical contact so you can easily segue into a full-on snuggle.

, Once you've broken the touch barrier and start to feel confident, you can smoothly transition into a complete snuggle.


Guys can do this by wrapping their arm around their date's shoulders and pulling her closer. This will allow her to rest her head on their chest or shoulders.
Girls can grab the guy's arm and sort of hug it, while resting their head on his shoulder or chest. If you want to get really comfy, you can also rest your legs across the guy's lap (just make sure this isn't uncomfortable for him).
Congratulations -- you are snuggling!

, Now that the snuggling has begun, there'll be no stopping you! Try some of these snuggletastic ideas:


Try a sitting spoon, where you both sit facing the same direction, with the small spoon sitting in between the big spoon's legs and lying back against their chest. The big spoon can then put their arms around the small spoon's shoulders.
Try resting your head in your date's lap, or allowing him/her to rest their head in yours. Then the sitting partner can stroke the lying partners hair or exposed arm.
If you've finally lost interest in whatever it is you were watching/doing before, you can try some more intimate snuggle poses which require both of you to be lying down. Try lying down facing each other, allowing your foreheads to touch and your legs to become intertwined. This position is perfect for intimate conversations.
Another great horizontal pose is for one person to lie on their back while the other lies on their side facing the first person and resting his/her head on the chest. This is a good position for napping in.

, Solo snuggling can get a little boring, so make sure to grab yourself some tasty treats to keep yourself entertained. Plus, a having warm drink like tea or hot cocoa is like getting a hug from the inside out!

, If you're snuggling solo, you won't have another body next to you for comfort and warmth, so grab the biggest, comfiest blanket you can find and wrap yourself up in it.

, Make yourself a little pillow fort from all of the pillows you can find around the house. Put a couple behind your back and head, press one against your stomach and hold one between your legs (this one is surprisingly good!).

, Okay, so this is cheating a bit on the ""solo"" part, but there's no denying that cats and dogs (or bunnies, chinchillas and other small furry creatures) make excellent snuggle buddies. Having your pet cuddled up beside you will bring your snuggling to a whole new level.

Make a dirty movie.Lower the lights and film yourselves getting intimate.,
Use props and toys.,
Pay attention to neglected areas of your partner’s body.When getting intimate don’t just go straight for the most obvious areas of your partner’s body.",How to Spice Things Up in the Bedroom2," This is particularly sexy if you do it the moment your partner walks in the door — you can kiss them then push them against the wall and continue to make out with them. It will make them feel like you just had to have them.Just don’t be offended if they have to pull away momentarily to pee or remove any heavy bags, jackets etc.!
Standing upright will also make intimate oral acts feel more intense as the blood rushes downward.Be sure that your partner trusts you before trying this one. If your partner has previously been attacked or assaulted, you should speak to your partner before trying this, as it could trigger painful memories.

, Take time to kiss and touch, and don’t just jump right into the heavier stuff.


When you do move on to the heavier stuff, keep going slowly!
Experts say that going slowly can even help resolve sexual problems and boost confidence., Try talking dirty or, at the very least, moaning and sighing while you and your partner are intimate. Voicing your appreciation will likely turn your partner on.


It might make you both laugh, too, but after you get used to it, it can be pretty sexy!

, You can have a quickie anywhere — the idea is that your passion for each other simply can’t wait.


Just make sure that you have enough time (i.e. won’t be late for anything important) and that you're in a safe place where you won’t get caught.

, This is a fun and relatively safe way to feel like you’re being naughty. Just make sure you don’t accidentally post the video online!


If you’re nervous that you might post the video online, turn off the Wi-Fi and data on the device you use to film yourselves. Afterwards, permanently delete the video, or save it to a USB stick and delete it from the device.

, Props such as handcuffs, feathers, scarves, and other intimate toys can help spice up your romantic sessions.A feather run lightly over erogenous zones can be a real turn-on.
A blindfold can help enhance the senses.

, Kiss their neck, their chest, their stomach, legs — really savour their body.

Roll some sexy dice.,
Compete to have your fantasy acted out.Begin with you and your partner each writing a key fantasy on a piece of paper.,
Have a sexy scavenger hunt.Leave messages containing codes and riddles for your partner to find.",How to Spice Things Up in the Bedroom3," Most sex shops sell sets of dice with sexy commands printed on them — for example, one dice roll might return “Kiss” and “Neck”. These are a fun way to explore different areas of each other’s bodies.

, Next, play a competitive game (e.g., poker, Go Fish, Monopoly, or even a video game). The winner of the game gets his/her fantasy acted out.


Be realistic with your fantasy. Make sure that it won’t hurt the other person’s feelings or be too expensive to achieve.
Choose your game wisely. A game like Monopoly may take hours to finish, which is fine as long as you’re not planning to act out the fantasy directly afterwards, as you might both be tired by then!

, These should lead him/her to a sexy location where you’re waiting.


Just make sure that your clues/riddles aren’t too difficult to decipher, otherwise you’ll be waiting a long time, and your partner might show up feeling frustrated and tired instead of aroused!

Casually wear sexy outfits.,
Wear costumes.,
Wear heels.",How to Spice Things Up in the Bedroom4," Do laundry, brush your teeth, make the bed etc. in sexy underwear or lingerie. Let your partner see you doing these things. Chances are he/she will enjoy the show and become aroused.Doing this when you’re by yourself might help put you in the mood, too, as you’ll anticipate your partner coming home and being turned on by you.
If you already regularly wander around the house half-naked, you might need to amp it up a bit — for example, by purchasing new/extra sexy underwear/lingerie.

, If your partner has a sense of humour or is into role-playing, you could pretend to be a sexy maid or butler when they come home.

, If you’re a woman, wearing heels while being intimate with your partner can give you an extra boost and make your legs look extra long and sexy.Just be careful about where your feet go — you don’t want to poke out any eyes!

Send flirty texts to your partner.Tailor your words to the situation and to your partner’s tastes: if your partner isn’t into dirty talk, make your text flirty; if your partner is into dirty talk, you can make your text more explicit.,
Watch a dirty movie together.Watching a dirty movie can be a fun way to get aroused.,
Touch your partner more often.,
Do a striptease.",How to Spice Things Up in the Bedroom5,"


Example: “I can't stop thinking about last night. ;)”
Example: “Mmm you looked so good leaving the house this morning… I want to do dirty things to you when we get home!”

, If you’re feeling skeptical, opt for an erotic parody of a movie that you both like — at the very least, you’ll end up laughing at how bad it is.


If you feel insecure about yourself, watching a dirty movie may not be a good decision, as you may wind up feeling inferior to the people you see onscreen. This should be a fun experience, not one that leaves you feeling sad!

, Touching your partner in intimate but not overtly sexual ways can help build a physical intimacy between the two of you.


As your partner makes coffee/prepares breakfast, walk up behind him/her, wrap your arms around his/her waist or hips, and gently kiss his/her neck.
While you're out for dinner or drinks, casually caress your partner’s leg, moving your hand up as high as possible without it being creepy. This should give him/her a hint that you’re thinking about getting intimate.Exchanging massages is another great way to build arousal from touch., This is more commonly done by women for their partners, but men can do it too. Find a song that gets you in the mood, create a strip routine that goes with it, set the mood (candles, curtains etc.), and perform for your partner.


The striptease can be as simple or complicated as you want. The key is to be yourself and do something that makes you feel good.
If you’re funny and like to make your partner laugh, incorporate that into the routine; if you’re more of a slow and sultry type, do a slow and sultry routine.
If you can’t dance, practise taking off your clothes in a sexy way without having to do much dancing.

Commit to a month of daily intimacy.Tell your partner that you’d like to spice things up a bit by being intimate every day this month.",How to Spice Things Up in the Bedroom6," A dull love life doesn’t necessarily mean that you and your partner are having problems, but relationship problems can cause bedroom problems.If you think that your dull love life might be reflecting problems in the relationship, you need to talk to your partner about your concerns.
You might find it useful to sit down and write your thoughts into a journal. This will help you clarify what you want to say when you talk to your partner.
If either of you struggle with sexual shame, emotional distance or insecurity, it may be difficult to become aroused. Talking about these things can boost your intimacy., Have a regular date night at least once a month and/or a short cuddle session a couple of times a week. Schedule these in and stick to them.


Doing things like this will show your partner that you value the relationship, and will help you two feel closer to one another.The stronger emotional connection that results from this will lead to a stronger physical connection, too., Doing new things together is a great way to get out of that slump and bond with your partner. Experiencing something new together builds memories and helps the two of you feel like a team.The excitement of trying something new can translate to excitement in the bedroom.

, Cooking together is a nice way to bond with your partner. You might even try different recipes that contain aphrodisiacs.


Popular aphrodisiacs include oysters, salmon, pine nuts, and foods containing capsaicin., Most people have heard of the post-exercise high. It happens because exercise stimulates the production of dopamine, the hormone that makes you feel good and boosts your sex drive.

Even if you don’t have a post-workout makeout session, working out together will boost intimacy and build confidence.
If exercise isn’t your thing, explore other things that you can regularly do together — for example, cooking, fishing, playing music, or any other hobby that you may both enjoy., Watch a standup comedy special or a funny sitcom or movie. Studies have shown that laughing gets your cardiovascular system working, resulting in better performance in bed.

Laughing together can also help you have fun despite any life stress you may be dealing with at the moment. It’s important to make time to have fun in each other’s company, no matter how stressful life may be.

Even just telling them to relax while you do the dishes, or bringing them home a special treat should have a positive effect., Agree that the two of you will buy one thing from the shop, whether it’s a pair of sexy dice, an erotic novel, lubricant, or something more adventurous.


Have fun while you’re there — some of things you see will be outright hilarious, and it’s okay to laugh. Just try not to laugh too hard, lest you scare or offend some of the other customers.

, It may feel too rigid to make plans like that, but it will also build anticipation.


If he/she agrees, you might even sit down and make a calendar of the things you will do each day. It doesn’t have to be overly specific — for example, one day you could “have a quickie” or “use a toy”.

You’ll also want to be able to brush your teeth and remove any makeup if you wear it.See what you can fit in whatever bag you usually carry with you. If you normally carry a very small clutch or wallet, you’ll need to bring something slightly bigger or only pack the bare essentials.
If your boyfriend lives far away and this is part of an overnight trip to visit him you can get away with packing a lot more. After all, you’ll need everything you would regularly travel with.;
, You probably don’t want to get into the awkward situation of having to ask to borrow a toothbrush, but simply choosing not to brush your teeth can be awkward too. Pack anything that you simply can’t live without.You may want to bring makeup remover if you wear makeup. Some women would rather go to bed with their makeup on than have their boyfriends see them without it. However, this can be bad for your skin, and if he’s your boyfriend he’s going to see you without makeup eventually.
Pack anything you’ll need for dealing with your hair. Some women need to tie their hair into a rag at night but choose not to when they stay with a boyfriend. Of course you’re not going to put your hair up in curlers on this special night, but maybe you want to pack a brush, comb, or detangling spray.

, There’s a long list of things people bring with them in anticipation of the next morning. Think about what you’ll need for your morning routine and how long you think you and your guy will hang out before you head home.If you're an early riser, bring your phone charger and a book or magazine. That way, if you're awake well ahead of him, you can keep yourself entertained if need be.
If they fit in your bag easily, you might want to bring a pair of shoes that are easier to walk in than your date shoes.
Don’t forget any medications that you need to take regularly.You can’t be sure what time you’ll be getting home in the morning.

, If you plan on being physically intimate, bringing condoms is always wise. Don’t assume your boyfriend will have condoms at his house. Bring your own. If you're not sure whether or not you'll be having intercourse, bring some along just in case.Condoms are the only birth control method that also protects against sexually transmitted infections.
Bringing lube or any other sexual accessories you like can be a good idea, too.

, This is a good rule of thumb any time you plan on going out for the night. In case things go awry or you haven’t made plans about how you’ll get home, it’s good to know you have some contingency cash on hand for emergencies.Cash is good to carry in case you both decide to spontaneously go out for drinks or ice cream or breakfast. You can’t always assume he’ll be paying.

, You may end up spending the morning or even most of the day with your boyfriend. If you went over to his house in a very confining outfit or something only appropriate for a late-night date, you’ll probably feel uncomfortable walking around the park the next morning or grabbing a casual breakfast in that.It’s great to keep some items in your wardrobe that you feel sexy in but that can be easily thrown on in the morning.

, This is the first thing to consider when deciding what the first night together will entail. Don’t assume that just because you’re sleeping over for the first time you’re obligated to have sex. However, if that’s what you’re hoping for, plan for it.Having sex can be a way of bringing you two closer together and forming an even more intimate bond.
Sex can also bring up tricky issues such as questions about monogamy, sexual history, sexual health, and potential pregnancy. If you’re not up for talking about these things with your guy, you may not be ready for the responsibility of being sexually active with him.
It’s okay to feel ambivalent about sex, especially the first time. If you aren’t ready to make a decision right now, that’s okay. Just make sure that you’re able to make a fully informed and consensual decision in the moment if sex comes up.

, This might feel awkward at first, but it’s a conversation that will come up eventually. There are a number of ways you can ask about your boyfriend’s expectations while still being charming and even flirtatious.If you want to keep the conversation flirty, you can ask what the sleeping arrangements will be. Say something like, “So, do you think we’ll be sharing a bed or should I bring my own sleeping bag?”
If you want to be more direct, you can say something like, “I know we’ve never had a sleepover before. I’m really excited, but I’d also like to talk about each of our expectations for the night. I’m wondering how you feel about sex and if you think we’re ready.”
If you already know exactly what you want and feel certain about it, you can simply start with that. Say something like, “Hey, I’m really excited to sleep over, but I want you to know ahead of time that I am not ready to have sex with you” or, “I’m so excited to stay over at your house tonight. I feel really ready to take things to the next level with sex.”

, If you’ve already made a decision for yourself, such as choosing to have sex or not have sex, that’s great. However, sometimes the specific circumstances may influence how you feel and you might change your mind in the moment. That’s okay. Listen to your gut.You may have not planned on having sex but find yourself feeling extremely comfortable and excited to try it.
You may have planned on having sex, but if you suddenly feel uncomfortable or nervous, it’s okay to change your mind.
Make sure that your decision is based on your feelings, not on pressure from your boyfriend, your friends, your parents, or other external pressures.

, You may be nervous about spending the night for the first time. However, remember that your boyfriend appreciates you for who you are. Not only that, he’s surely just as nervous as you. Take some of the pressure off by relaxing together and doing things you normally enjoy together.Your boyfriend is probably nervous about you seeing what his house and room look like. Put him at ease by letting him know anything you like or appreciate about his living space. You can say something like, “I really like that poster you’ve got on the wall,” or, “Wow, this is a great location you’ve got.”
If his place isn’t that great to hang out in, you can go for a walk or a drive. Take your date elsewhere and come back just to sleep.

, This may involve washing your face, brushing your hair and teeth and doing anything else you need to do before going to bed. Of course, at home you may have a more involved routine, but keep it streamlined for tonight. That way, you won’t spend all of your time in the bathroom with your boyfriend wondering what you’re doing.You don’t need to explain what you’re doing in the bathroom. He may wonder, but that’s fine.
If you usually braid your hair at night or tuck it up in a rag, you might want to skip that for the first few nights you spend together, if you’re comfortable with that.

, The first night you spend the night with another person, your brain actually stays a tiny bit awake during the night as a way of keeping you safe. You may wake up when your boyfriend moves around or changes positions in the bed.Don’t plan to sleep over at your boyfriend’s house for the first time the night before a big day at school or work.
You may need to catch up on sleep with a nap the next day, even if you try to go to bed early.

, If you hadn’t planned on sleeping over, you may not have brought a change of clothes or thought about planning for what you’d sleep in. Even if you did plan, it may not have made sense to bring pajamas or a change of clothes. What you wear to sleep will depend on how comfortable you feel with your boyfriend and your level of intimacy.


If you end up having sex or being physically intimate in other ways, you may feel comfortable sleeping with nothing on at all, or sleeping in only your underwear.
If he lives with his family, you’ll want to sleep in something conservative in case a parent or sibling barges in or you need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.
You can always ask to borrow a T-shirt to sleep in. Many guys find that endearing., When it’s time to go to bed because you’re both tired, it’s time to go to sleep. If you’re sleeping in the same bed, you’ll need to find a comfortable position for both of you. There may also be things that make it hard to get comfortable, such as:If he snores. You may want to bring a pair of earplugs, just in case!
If one of you steals the blankets or you like very different sleeping temperatures.
If he likes to cuddle and you don’t (or vice versa).

, If you wake up first, it’s considerate to let your boyfriend sleep in a bit. After all, you’d probably appreciate the same courtesy. If you wake up first, you can either stay in bed cuddling with him or head to the bathroom to complete your morning routine so that when he wakes up you already look fresh.If he wakes up first, he may head to the bathroom before you’re up to brush his teeth and make himself presentable, too., You both might want to spend the morning and even most of the day together, but you might not. Hopefully, you already know what your plans are for the day. If you didn’t make plans, don’t assume that you’ll be spending all morning together.Did you talk about having breakfast? If not, you can suggest something or ask what he’d like to do. You can say something like, “Do you want to make breakfast together?” or, “I’d love a cup of coffee. Is there a good place nearby?”
Does one of you have to go to work or school? If you do, let him know. You can say something like, “I have to be at work in an hour, but I’d be happy to have a quick coffee together, if you want.” You can also say, “Do you have plans for the day? I’m free, but I understand if you’ve got things to do.”
Of course, your boyfriend should care for you and have lots of respect for you, so don’t feel shy about letting him know if you do or don’t want to spend the morning together. You should be able to express your feelings honestly in a healthy relationship., This is a fairly common flirtation tip. Even though you’re already in a relationship, it can be a great way to get your guy excited. It can also be a nice way to leave him something that keeps him thinking about you and ensures you’ll see each other again soon. Some things you might “accidentally” leave behind include:A piece of clothing
A piece of jewelry you always wear
Your toothbrush or makeup
The book you’re reading
The DVD series you’re watching together

, If he lives with parents or siblings, you want to be respectful in their presence. Follow any house rules and behave modestly.


If his parents have specified that you'll sleep in separate rooms or beds, follow that rule. It could be disastrous if they happen to see that you've gone behind their backs.
Avoid displaying too much affection in front of his family. You can of course be sweet to each other, but avoid kissing or petting each other in front of family.
Dress modestly for sleep and around the house. Don't get up to go to the bathroom in a T-shirt and underwear, for example.

But in healthy relationships both partners are able to work together and account for their own actions. Each partner will try to grapple with their problems together. Look for the following signs of healthy relationships to judge your own:

You and your partner support, respect, and value each other.
You and your partner continue to socialize and have friends outside of your own intimate relationship.
You and your partner can resolve disagreements and misunderstandings with an open and honest form of communication.
You and your partner are honest with how each of you feel and what you need out of the relationship.;
, Catfishing refers to someone pretending to be a person they are not via the internet. If you meet someone great on the internet yet they refuse to talk to you on the phone or they come up with excuses for why they cannot video chat you, be warned. They might send you pictures or voice messages, but this doesn’t mean that they are truthfully representing themselves. Be aware of any potential deception or if a person truly is too good to be true.If you’re falling for someone, ask to video call them so that you can see their face and hear their voice in real-time.
Some people use dating and romance websites to scam others. If the person starts asking you for money or other items or services, be aware that they might be scamming you., When we’ve been in a relationship for a while, we can sometimes be oblivious to bad signs. This can especially be true if it’s a new relationship, where exciting highs are mixed with lows. Try to keep aware of your emotional and psychological state in a relationship, as this can clue you in on issues to resolve. Look out for some of the following problem signs:

Feelings of depression and anxiety.
Feeling fearful of your partner or the situation you’re in with your partner.
Feeling hopeless, helpless, a loss of self-worth, and increase in feelings of low self-esteem.
Decline in physical health and lowering of immune system.
Feelings of guilt, shame, frustration, hurt, or anger.
Development of addictive behavior (like an increase in alcohol use or starting to use, become dependent on, or abuse other drugs).

, Control means exerting influence over others’ actions or behaviors or their environment in general. People who are controllers typically do so because they fear the unpredictable and often fear being at the mercy of others. This type of behavior can come from past traumas that left them feeling helpless and vulnerable—maybe they were abused or abandoned, or maybe they have anxiety, low self-esteem, or fear failure. To avoid feeling vulnerable again, they may act in unhealthy ways. This can take the form of:


Micro-Managing the actions and behaviors of others, including keeping their partner from seeing friends or family and having strict rules to maintain daily structures and routine.
Lying to their partner.
Physical, emotional, or psychologically abuse. Also, bullying, taunting, and gaslighting.
Sexual abuse.
Many people who have control issues initially exhibit signs of their control through disordered eating habits (i.e., very restrictive and rigid diets, sometimes anorexic or bulimic in nature), compulsive exercising, self-harming behaviors, obsessive compulsiveness with tidying or cleaning, and substance abuse.
Some signs a partner with control issues can exhibit are: feelings of shame, anxiety, depression, chronic stress, manipulation, and a host of many other mental health concerns.

, Keep an eye out for someone who is violent or abusive. Both men and women can be abusive, though men tend to be more physically aggressive. Physical abuse includes violence or force used against you. For example, they might grab you, hit you, pull your hair, or throw something at you. Sexual abuse may be forcing you or pressuring you to do sexual acts, being purposefully rough, ignoring your requests to stop, doing things that hurt you, or initiating sexual activity without your consent.If you’re being abused, don’t hope that your partner will change or that things will improve. You can’t change this person. It’s best to leave and get help and support.
Sexual abuse and sexual assault can refer to a variety of crimes, including the following:

Rape, sexual assault, incest, and child molestation. Other forms of sexual abuse that doesn’t neatly fit into the common definition include publishing of nude photos without your consent, acting out inappropriate sexual behaviors, or having sex while children are present.


The following behaviors or actions are also considered physically abusive:

Grabbing someone or physically restraining you against your will in a harmful way.
Punching, burning, shaking, biting, pinching, or slapping.
Beating or whipping with an object.
Poisoning or causing someone to become physically ill.
Any other form of debilitating action towards someone that causes harm.



, Verbal and emotional abuse may be more subtle than physical or sexual abuse, but nonetheless, can cause harm and affect your self-esteem. Some examples of emotional and verbal abuse might include insulting you, embarrassing you in public, telling you what to do or who you can see, or blaming you for their bad behavior. Your partner might tell you that you’re too sensitive, make you the punchline for their jokes, and make you feel like you have to walk on eggshells.If your partner makes you feel small or cuts you down, this can indicate verbal abuse.

, Someone who is financially reckless may be reckless in other areas of their life, so keep an eye out for how they handle their finances. Your partner may also use finances to control you and your behavior. For example, they might restrict your access to money and finances, get credit cards or loans in your name without your permission, or use your credit cards or checkbook.Especially if your partner makes more money than you, they might use their financial power over you in order to get you to do things or behave the way they want you to.

, Your partner may try to hide their habits or downplay them, so be aware of any problems they have with drugs or alcohol. An addict might say that drugs or alcohol help them cope with stress or that they don’t use that often. Some signs of addiction might be covering up their use or making excuses. If they use, they might lie or downplay what they did, even if there’s evidence against them. If you’re concerned, recommend inpatient drug treatment.If it’s obvious that they have a problem yet they refuse to admit it or change their ways, it might be time to go.
Some people are willing to change, but recognize a relationship with someone who has an addiction is often very difficult. Proceed with caution.

, Ideally, your partner should comfort you and affirm the way you feel in an empathetic way. If your partner belittles you, minimizes your needs or wants, or ignores your requests for things that matter to you, you might feel invalidated or unable to bring your wants or needs to them. Some invalidating statements might include, “You’re blowing this out of proportion,” “I don't care about this,” or, “Just chill.” Having your feelings invalidated might create disconnected feelings between you and make you feel less understood.Your partner should care about what you think and how you feel. For example, if you come home after a difficult day, they shouldn’t say, “Get over it.” Instead, you might appreciate them saying, “I’m sorry it’s been a tough day.”
You shouldn’t feel like your partner feels contempt toward you.

, You want to trust the person you’re falling in love with. Trust means being consistent in actions and words, respecting boundaries, and being dependable. It means being respectful of one another’s privacy but not being secretive. If they are often secretive or evasive, start asking some questions. When you ask questions, you should feel like you are getting an honest answer.Listen to your instincts. A lack of trust on your part can be a sign of a lack of trustworthiness on their part.
You should trust your partner not to be aggressive, violent, or threaten you in any way.

, It’s normal to be a little jealous, but if your partner’s jealousy impacts your relationship greatly, take note. For example, they might demand that you stop spending time with people they don’t like or tell you to wear different clothes or only clothes they want you to wear. Maybe they check your emails, phone calls, or texts to monitor your behavior and make sure you are not cheating or acting in a way they don’t like.If your partner is suspicious of you and other people often, the jealousy is likely unhealthy.

, Take note of how the person relates to their friends and family. If they’ve cut out their family and burned bridges with multiple friends, this might be a warning sign of conflicts and interpersonal problems. While not everyone gets along with their families, look for someone who can maintain relationships and who is respected among their friends.


If they talk about conflicts in their relationships, notice how they talk about them. For example, do they blame others and take no responsibility for their own role? Ideally, they should take some responsibility for things going poorly or for not responding well to a troubled situation.

, If your partner’s needs seem to take priority over your own needs much of the time, you may be dating a narcissist. They might be preoccupied with their own lives, feel contempt toward you and others, get you to serve their needs, and cross (or violate) your boundaries. This kind of person thinks they are the best at everything and no one will measure up to them.Sexual narcissism refers to gratification without consideration of the other partner, making outrageous demands, or frequent criticisms.

, Have you noticed that your likes, dislikes, opinions, way you speak, or type of dress have changed as a result of being in the relationship? If you’ve changed who you are in a major way, this can be a bad sign. You should feel comfortable to be yourself and express your own opinions without fearing judgment and criticism.If you and your partner disagree, both you and they should be able to accept the difference without it causing major problems.

, If you want a mature partner, look for someone who has a job and can provide for themselves. If you absolutely want to get married and have kids, be wary of someone who is sure they don’t want to get married or have kids. Think about your values and non-negotiable items in a relationship and make sure your partner’s line up. Have important discussions about the future, especially before you become invested in the relationship.


For example, if you have a dog, it’s probably important to you that this person likes dogs, or at least your dog.

, It’s easy to overlook certain comments or actions early in a relationship, but give them some serious thought. Maybe even your first date had a moment when you felt uncomfortable or your partner said something that was off-putting.For example, some people enjoy creating drama or conflict in relationships. If this is not something you want, keep your eye out for these patterns.


Think about your positive versus negative interactions. Your positive experiences should far outweigh the negative ones at this point.

, Nobody really enjoys talking about exes, but speaking about past relationships can help you get an idea of what it’s like to date and be with your partner. For example, if they have never had a long-term relationship, they may not know how to date long-term. If they are on bad terms with all of their exes, see what happened. Ideally, you want to find someone who has learned from their mistakes and takes equal blame in problems.


If you are concerned they might not be over an ex, talk about their past relationship and see how they describe the person, the relationship, and why it ended.
You might not want to date someone who describes all their exes as “crazy” because you might become one at some point.

Anticipate the end of the “honeymoon phase."",
Give each other space.,
Spend time together.,
Appreciate each other.,
Work on establishing trust.,
Share things with your partner.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Stay in Love1," It is natural to be enamored with someone the first few months you are dating, feeling like nothing could ever come between you. Just keep in mind that this feeling does not last forever. After the initial feelings of lust have worn off, you may have to work a bit more to keep your relationship going strong.Keep in mind that the end of the honeymoon phase is not a bad thing, but rather an important step in your relationship. Now is the time you get to know your partner better and cultivate a long-lasting, loving relationship.;
, It is important to spend time away from your partner in order to have time for your own interests and goals. Spending too much time together can cause problems in a relationship. If you spend every waking moment with your partner, then you may not appreciate the time that you have together as much. Make sure to plan activities apart and retain your independence as you continue your relationship.Try setting aside a night or day each week where you both do something on your own or with friends.

, Although it is important to have some time away from your partner now and then, spending time together is also very important. Make sure that you set aside a little time each day to catch up, perhaps over your morning coffee, over dinner, or during an evening walk.Make time to do things together like you did when you first started dating. For example, you can plan a movie night, a hiking trip, or a visit to a local museum.

, Love may fade in a relationship if one or both partners do not feel appreciated. Make sure that you tell your partner what you appreciate about him or her on a regular basis. Be specific and make sure that the things you mention are about your partner, not about you. If you appreciate your partner on a regular basis, it is more likely that you will also be appreciated in return.For example, you might tell your partner that you appreciate what a good listener he is or that you appreciate the way that she always has something positive to say when you get home from work.

, In order to ensure a lasting love, you need to be trustworthy and be able to trust your partner in return. Building trust requires you and your partner to be vulnerable with each other, keep promises, and keep the lines of communication open. Each time that you trust your partner to take care of something for you or to keep his or her word, you are providing a chance for your partner to follow through and earn more trust from you.For example, if your partner is responsible for paying the electric bill each month, don’t constantly remind him or her to do so. Trust that your partner will pay the bill. If he/she does, then you can feel more comfortable trusting your partner with bigger things.

, As your relationship progresses, you can build a deeper bond by sharing things with your partner that you haven’t yet told them. Tell your partner about your fears, hopes, and dreams for the future and ask about theirs as well.Be considerate of the things your partner shares with you, even if they seem unlikely or do not appeal to you.

, Physical attraction is not everything in a relationship, but it is important that you look good and feel healthy in order to be your best. Make sure that you are taking care of your basic needs, such as diet, exercise, sleep, and grooming, so that you will look and feel good when you spend time with your partner..

Whisk your love away on a romantic getaway.",How to Spice up Your Sex Life," Setting can do wonders and spark your romantic impulses. We’re not just talking about whether to have the lights “on” or “off” but creating a relaxing mood and environment that adds some zest to your routine.Add candles and/or dim lights, for example. Candles make a room feel romantic, but also give off a quality of light that flatters the body. Choose scented candles if your lover likes a particular scent. Soft yellow incandescent bulbs also have hue that can be extremely sensual.
Play some sexy music. Aim for tunes that are soft and slow and that don’t overpower the mood. You can never go wrong with a playlist by Marvin Gaye, Al Green, or Usher. Or, try a music service like Pandora or Spotify.
Sprinkle a trail of rose petals from the front door to the bedroom. Let your sweetheart know that you’re waiting for her in the bedroom. She’ll be brimming with anticipation.
Get rid of distractions. Turn off your phone, your television, and your radio and concentrate on your partner. Avoid the radio for playing romantic music. Loud commercials can kill the mood.;
, Anticipation and waiting can be highly romantic – even erotic. Let your partner know that you can’t wait to see her. Text, leave a note, or surprise her with a random call at work.For instance, you might call your sweetheart and tell her that you can’t wait to see her. “I’m really looking forward to kissing you later tonight.”
You don’t have to be explicitly sexual. Just saying, “Hi, I love you and hope that you’re having a good day!” is enough to build anticipation and passion.
Try the “Forty Beads Method.” This method was developed by a woman who wanted to spice things up with her husband. How does it work? Each partner has a bowl in which the other can drop a bead when she feels amorous, and the other partner has a certain amount of time to act on the request., We all get stuck in ruts at some point. And daily ruts can kill romance. One way to get out of a rut is to make time for passion with well-planned, romantic dates. Take turns planning dates with your partner to experience new things and to create lasting memories together. The more time you spend together, the more likely you’ll be to break out of your rut and rekindle the romance.


We’re not just talking about the bedroom here, but rather candle-lit dinners, walks at sunset, and cuddling over a movie. These will help to set the scene for a romantic night.
Go to dinner and a movie. Believe it or not, this old-school date idea still works surprisingly well. Be sure to pick a sit-down restaurant and a movie that both of you will like.
Make dinner together. Try making a dish from scratch to tap into your creativity. You might also flirt with your partner while you cook by splattering sauce on him/her or stealing a kiss here and there.
Go on a picnic. A picnic at the park or beach is a great way to get outdoors and spend some quality time. Picnics are great options for sunny days and cost practically nothing.
Go to a sporting event or a concert. Take your partner to an event to provide entertainment and stimulate conversation at the same time. Or, do something active and adventurous! Try rock climbing, snowboarding, or zip-lining. If it’s winter, go sledding or ice skating.

, We are aiming for passion and romance and a whole body-mind experience, not just sex. Sexual intimacy goes hand-in-hand with emotional closeness, so don’t neglect foreplay. In fact, studies show that length of foreplay is a big indicator of long-term relationship health.Take things slowly. Cuddle, talk, and let the anticipation build even more. After all, the brain is the most important erogenous zone.Move your way slowly into kisses and caresses.
Try slowly undressing your partner item by item. Throw her clothes across the room for added intensity.
Make sure to caress, fondle, and touch your partner’s body. The more points of contact you and your partner make, the more intense and close your experience will be.
Make eye contact. Try keeping your eyes open, even while kissing. Gazing into your sweetheart’s eyes is intense and lets her know that you’re paying attention.

, Developing clear communication will help you to be more attentive to your partner’s likes, dislikes, wants, and needs. You’ll know her better in mind as well as body.


Try asking your partner what she likes. This question in itself can be a turn-on. After all, what’s sexier than a partner who truly pays attention to your wants and needs?
One effective method for communication is to talk in “I” statements. Starting a sentence with “I like...” or “I feel...” puts your feelings and thoughts first and can be a less judgmental way of expressing your wants.
For example, if you like what your lover is doing you might say, “I really like it when you do X to me” or “It’s hot when you do Y.” If you want your lover to do something differently, an “I” statement feels less accusatory, i.e. “I’d prefer that we go more slowly” rather than “Whoa, slow down.”

, Clothing can add a bit of adventure to your love life. The sexiness of men’s and women’s lingerie lies in the initial surprise. Consider buying some for the first time or changing things up. If you continue to wear the same lingerie, the mystery factor will eventually vanish.


Vary your wardrobe with several different colors and materials like leather, lace, feathers, and silk. Switch up the outfit to keep it fresh. Try different hairstyles or makeup combinations to compliment your sexy look.
Guys can stock up on sexy clothes, too. Nowadays there’s a pretty large market for men’s lingerie. While you may not go for skimpy lace or a leather thong, your partner probably has a preference when it comes to your bedroom attire. Ask him or her what would be a turn-on.

, We don’t mean Christmas shopping. Find a discreet sex store and go together with your partner to peruse the wares. Take turns picking out different toys to try or videos that you might want to watch. Give each other the opportunity to choose the gadgets that look most interesting and fun.There are all sorts of bedroom toys that you might try. Handcuffs and blindfolds can enhance mystery and excitement in the bedroom, for instance. For the even more adventurous, there are also gags and whips – though this might not be for everyone.Try alternating and using the toys on each other when you return home. You can either switch places or dedicate an intimate experience entirely to the pleasure of one party.

, Some people find acting out fantasies and parts to be exciting. If this appeals to you, plan out a scenario in advance to create a fantasy character or situation. Role playing takes you out of the restrictions of daily life and puts you in a context where sexual fantasies can become a reality.Try a scenario that involves two different characters. Some combinations include the classic sexy nurse and doctor or cop and robber. Other people keep “dress-up” boxes on hand to let their imaginations run wild.
Become your character. Think about the specifics of your character’s personality. Try to imagine how your character acts, how she talks, and how she would use her body.
Dress up for the part! Put effort into making a costume. An important part of role play is your altered appearance. Take the time to purchase or make sexy costumes and prepare your hair and makeup if necessary.
You can ad lib or prepare a script. In fact, a script might be useful in overcoming your self-consciousness. Chances are the words will start flowing as you get deeper into character.

, Add taste to your sensual experiences with food, including desserts, edible lotions, and even edible clothing accessories. You can even target foods that are known aphrodisiacs like oysters and chocolate.


Some classic choices – for obvious reasons – include chocolate sauce and whipped cream. Both can be drizzled or applied directly.
Edible lotions, undergarments, and frostings are often available at adult stores. Keep an eye out for these products during your shopping excursions.
Do like the Romans: take turns feeding each other fruit like grapes or strawberries. These aren’t messy and are easy to eat wherever you may be.
Wrap your arms around each other before taking a sip of your beverage of choice. While this looks most elegant when done with champagne flutes, other beverages will work, as well.

, Some people find adult movies to be exciting and also helpful for new ideas. If both of you are willing, consider renting or buying a film and having a private screening.


Watching an adult movie can take you and your partner out of your normal routine. For example, you might incorporate it into a role playing game. If you're too shy to tell your partner you want to try certain things, the movie may also prompt you.
Adult motives aren’t for everyone. Make sure that both you and your partner feel comfortable with the idea beforehand.

, Some people also find that switching partners or inviting others to join them adds zest and excitement to the same old routine. For them, bringing others into the mix adds to the experience and allows them to appreciate their partner more, because of the sense of competition.


While the presence of competition can help rekindle your passion for your partner and give you new ideas, it may have some unexpected consequences. You might find yourself jealous, for example. Obviously, inviting friends will not be for everyone.
Make sure that both you and your partner are comfortable with the idea of inviting others into your sex life.
Practice safe sex always, but especially if you have multiple partners. This sort of behavior increases your risk for sexually transmitted diseases., The recent success of the “Fifty Shades” book series shows that lots of people are interested in getting a bit kinky in the bedroom. While it might not be for you, some people consider the playfulness, excitement, and control of kink and bondage to be a big turn-on.


You’ll have to raise the subject with your partner first. You might start with hypotheticals. For example, present your desire to him as a dream you had in which he and you are acting out these desires. See how responds. If he’s open to it, perhaps try adding some elements into your normal routine like dirty talk.If you’re both comfortable, using blindfolds or handcuffs can be very sexy. For instance, you might consider putting a blindfold or your partner and leading him into another area of the house. The fact that he doesn’t know where he is, and that you’re in total control, can be really compelling.

, Change your routine, and change it in unexpected ways! We’re not, again, just talking about your sexual routine. Whether it is surprising your sweetheart with a night out, a weekend getaway, or a bit of bedroom innovation, try things that will break your rut.Surprise your partner. Bring her flowers, chocolates, or a small gift for no reason other than that you love her. Or, plan a secret outing for dinner, to a movie, to a play, or to a concert.
Book a room at a local hotel. Pretend to be tourists in your own town and take your partner out for a one-night stay. If money isn’t a concern, book at a nice hotel that you both admire.
For sexual change, try a different location. It’s too easy to get into a routine time and place for intimacy. Be creative. Do you have a pool table? Or maybe even a real pool? Try different places around the house or even outdoors to keep it fresh and exciting.
The same holds true for how you are intimate. The human body is remarkably versatile and flexible. Don’t neglect the many different ways in which you and your love can be together in the bedroom. If you’re not sure what the options for different positions are, look for a book at your local adult store., Sometimes work and chores get in the way of being in the moment. We try to make time for our partner, but, sometimes, end up with mechanical, routine date nights. If this is your problem, try to break out of your schedule. Woo your sweetheart spontaneously.


Again, surprise her with a date or even just some quality time together. It can be a movie, dinner, or just watching television together.
Make an effort to do this even if you have a difficult work schedule. If you normally have work to do on Saturday, try to get it done somehow in order to have a few special hours together.
Have a lunchtime quickie. Come home for lunch with your partner, and for a roll in bed. You’ll find that switching things up will increase the passion in your relationship and boost your mood.

, Quality time – just you and your beloved – is an essential part of a relationship. You need time together, period. A weekend getaway is one way to get it.If you can afford it, book a suite at a ski resort or hotel or rent a cottage on a secluded lake. The point is to have time for just the two of you.
If you don’t have much money, it’s still possible to get away. Like camping? Pack your tent and head off to the nearest state park.
Weekend getaways are already somewhat spontaneous, as they take you out of your routine. However, a surprise getaway can be even better. Set the mood on your arrival – flowers and champagne work great!

View each other as a team.,
Accept responsibility for your role in conflicts.,
Forgive your lover for their flaws.,
Be willing to make sacrifices for each other.,
Accept your partner’s quirks.",How to Stay in Love2," Loving couples refer to their partners as their “other half” for a reason: they work together. You should feel comfortable chasing your dreams and helping your partner realize his or her dreams. Working on projects together, like starting a garden or redecorating the house, teaches you to respect and trust each other while fostering a loving attitude.



Listen to your partner when he or she wants to discuss something or needs your support. Make sure that your partner knows that you are on his or her side and that you want to offer your support in any way that you can., In every relationship, conflicts will arise and you will need to find ways to work through them. One of the best things you can do to deal with conflicts is to know when you are at fault (or at least a little at fault) and try to find a way to compromise with your partner. Taking responsibility for your role in the conflicts that arise in your relationship will help to make it easier to find areas for compromise.For example, if you and your partner are having an argument about the best way to use your tax refund, consider whether you are part of the cause of this conflict. Have you fully considered your partner’s perspective? Why don’t you agree with him/her? What might be a good compromise that could help resolve the conflict?

, No one is perfect, but people often forget this about the ones they love. Your partner is going to make mistakes and hurt your feelings sometimes. While it may be difficult to forgive them, it is something that you need to learn how to do in order to maintain a loving relationship. To avoid developing animosity in your relationship, accept that your partner is not perfect and forgive them when they are wrong.Remember, you have to be willing to give forgiveness to get forgiveness, and you are going to make your share of mistakes too.

, When you love someone, your life becomes joined with theirs. Things you did when you were single become harder, and you need to think about your partner’s feelings when considering your plans. You can’t always do exactly what you want to do when you are in a relationship, so you have to get used to sacrificing for each other now and then.For example, if you and your partner both want to see a different movie on your date night, one of you may have to sacrifice and say, “Okay, let’s see the one you want to see this week.” Then the next time there is a conflict of choice, the partner who sacrificed last time should get to choose.
You may encounter bigger sacrifices at some point in your relationship as well. For example, if you are offered a job in another state, your partner would have to decide if he or she is willing to sacrifice his or her job, friends, etc. to enable you to take that job.

, As you get to know someone, you find out new little things about them that you may find strange. Everyone has different preferences and habits, and you cannot expect your partner to do everything just like you do. Do your best to accept and appreciate their quirks instead of trying to change them.


If something your partner does truly bothers you or causes you anxiety, then you need to talk to your partner about it. Avoid putting your complaint into critical terms or demanding your partner to change. Instead, say how the behavior makes you feel and ask if there is anything that your partner thinks might help to solve the problem.For example, try saying, “When you leave your dirty clothes on the floor it makes me feel frustrated and anxious. Is there anything we could do to make it easier to put clothes in the hamper?”

Plan a vacation together.,
Create traditions.,
Create moments together.,
Spice up your life in the bedroom.,
Show how much you love someone with gifts, surprises, or adventures.",How to Stay in Love3," Even if you can’t afford a vacation right now, sitting down for a few hours and discussing your dream vacation will help you to reconnect. It will also provide you both with something to look forward to and daydream about. If you get to take the vacation someday, it will be extra special because of all of the time you spent planning it together. If you never get a chance to take the vacation together, you will still have many happy memories of planning the vacation., Having shared traditions is a great way to strengthen the bond between you and your partner.Brainstorm with your partner to create some traditions that will strengthen your bond. You can look forward to these traditions and create new ones as your relationship continues to progress.


Many traditions evolve over time as a result of your mutual likes and dislikes. For example, you might both enjoy watching the Oscars and start a tradition of having an Oscar watching party where you both dress up and present each other with an award.

, Make a conscious effort to do things together. Even if your schedules are tight, make sure that you set aside some time to spend together every week. You can cook a meal together, go shopping together, or watch a movie. Try to have a date every week to stay connected., Things can become boring between couples that have been together for a long time, but you can always do things to spice up your sex life. If you are willing to try something new, you can reinvigorate your sex life and breathe passion into the relationship.


Be open and honest about your desires – you should always talk with your partner before trying something new.

, It is too easy to take someone for granted when you’ve been with them for years, but you need to take the time to acknowledge how much your partner matters to you.Bring flowers home from work, bake a cake just because, or buy those new shoes your lover has been eyeing. Showing that you think about your partner even when you are not together is a fantastic way to keep your love alive.


Remember that you cannot buy someone’s love. Any gifts you buy should be thoughtful, not just expensive.

Tap into your emotional side.,
Be as supportive as possible.,
Trust your lover.,
Reassure your love with words.",How to Show Your Lover That You Really Love Them1," Intimate moments are a great way to show true love. They require both you, and your lover, to be vulnerable and open. This means that you have to share your deepest thoughts and feelings with one another by talking and listening.Hold him during hard times, and allow him to vent in your arms about anything.
Rub your fingers through your lovers hair as you listen and provide comfort.;
, Even if you do not necessarily agree with something he does, stand by your partner's side. This shows that you love him for who he really is, and you are not going anywhere. Do not put him down for seemingly obscure or odd interests, and always applaud any accomplishments he makes.Even if you advised against something, but your partner did it anyway and now regrets it, don’t say, “I told you so."" Instead, be supportive and say, ""Everyone makes mistakes. We just have to learn from them and move on."" This provides support during tough times.

, To show that you really love someone, you have to show how much trust you have for him. Remember, in order to receive trust, you have to show it.Do not doubt stories he tells you, and refrain from snooping through personal belongings he may leave out.
Try not to show jealousy. Jealousy can stem from having a lack of trust, and your lover will feel upset by the lack of yours if you act jealous.

, We all have doubts about our relationships. Verbal communication is a direct way to express how you feel, and confirm your love. Here are some things you can say:


""I am so lucky to have met you. I love you so much.""
""You are my one and only. I never want to be with anyone else.""

Make love in new positions.,
Get it on in new places.,
Go to a sex or lingerie store together.,
Role play.,
Try something new together.",How to Spice Up Your Relationship1," Though you may have gotten nice and comfortable in the missionary position, it may be time for some changes in the bedroom. Having sex the same old way can make it feel like a routine, and the more you mix things up, the more likely you'll be to want to get it on more often. Here are some things you can do:


Reverse roles. This may feel funny at first, but you'll love it. If you're always on top and your honey is on the bottom, switch it up. You'll be more turned on by the change.
When you make love, make a goal of not having sex in your usual position at all. Find a completely new way to be turned on.
Don't be afraid to try completely new positions. Look up positions on the Internet, read the Karma Sutra, or if you're bold, ask your best friend for love-making position tips.
Be more flexible. Take a yoga class together, or go for a run together and work on stretching before and after. Preparing your bodies to be more flexible when you're in the sack. If you learn to do a split, you can use it to your advantage in the bedroom. If you're a girl, try to get flexible enough to wrap your legs around your partner's head when he's on top.
Make love standing up, or with the person on top standing up. And don't be afraid to try a little pre-sex oral sex on your partner when he or she is standing up.
Make love when one person is seated on a coach while the other is on top of him or her.
Be adventurous in your positions, but don't do anything you're not comfortable with. Both partners have to be committed to trying new things or your sex may get unpleasant.;
, Having sex in new positions can work wonders for your sex life. Having sex in new positions in a new place will spice up your relationship astronomically. A new place can be anything from a new corner of your bedroom to a hotel or even a camping tent. Here are some things to try:


Check into a hotel to make love. The hotel doesn't have to be in an exotic location — it could be just a few blocks from your home. You'll feel sexy for checking in for such an obvious purpose. Don't even pack your bags if you're close to home. That will make it even more obvious that you're there for one reason.
Take a hot vacation. Plan a trip to a romantic island or a beach. Pick a place where there's not much to do but lounge on the beach and indulge in each other. If you're too busy sightseeing, you won't have time to set your sights on your lovemaking.
Having sex in your car may sound uncomfortable, but it can be pretty hot, too. Having sex in public can get you in a lot of trouble, so only do it if you're in a place that is completely secluded, where there's no chance you'll be caught.
Have sex somewhere where you can get caught. Though this is inadvisable for many reasons, but if you're really feeling kinky, get it on somewhere where you can get in trouble, like a friend's house, or in your own home while people are over.
Have sex in a new part of your pad. Vow not to have sex in your bed for a week or two, or even a month. Try your kitchen counter, your shower, or even your favorite chair.
Get it on on your couch. Your couch isn't just for being lazy and channel surfing.

, Don't be embarrassed about taking this trip. Lots of couples do it together all the time, and you'll be turned on by buying things you'll use or wear in the bedroom. Dress up when you go to the store. Hold hands. Giggle. It may feel a little silly, but it's also hot.


Buy some hot lingerie. If you're female, but some lacy bras and panties, thongs, garters, fishnet stockings, or corsets. Don't be afraid to buy something that is completely over the top or doesn't feel like you. That's what being adventurous is all about.
But some scented candles, sexy oils, and sexy lotions. You can light the candles and massage the oil and lotion into each other to get ready to get it on.
Pick up some sex toys. Buy some whips, hand cuffs, or whatever else floats your boat. They're not guaranteed to work, but try them on for size. Just buying them together will already spice up your relationship.

, You need to spice up your relationship because you're feeling that you've fallen into the same roles day after day. What better way to spice up your relationship than some lighthearted, fun roleplaying? This will require you to take some risks, but the rewards will be worth it. The next time you make love, try out one of these scenarios:


Pretend that you've gotten in a big fight. Get really heated. Yell and throw things around. Then have some hot make-up sex.
If you're a girl, pretend that your boyfriend or husband is knocking on the door to repair a leak, ask you to sign a bill, or just because he's lost and needs directions. Invite him to come in for a drink, and take it from there.
Try on some outfits from the sex store. There will be plenty of ideas to get your imagination going, whether you're dressing up as a police officer, princess, or sex kitten.
Tell your partner your favorite role play fantasy, no matter how ridiculous it may be. Then go for it!

, Being adventurous isn't all about having sex in adventurous ways. You and your honey can improve your relationship by stepping out of your comfort zones and trying something wild and new together. Here are some things you can try:


Do something crazy outdoors. Go zip-lining, bungee jumping, or sky diving. This will make you feel exhilarated and will bring you closer together.
Travel to a completely exotic location. This could mean Singapore or Argentina. Go to a place that is completely foreign to you together.
Take up a new exciting hobby. This could be mountain biking or karate. Just pick something both of you have never done before and stick to it. You'll be learning something new and will be spending more time together in the process.
Eat foods you've never had before. Make a point of going to a restaurant that serves cuisine you've never had before at least once or twice a month. You'll be treating your taste buds while making more time for conversation.

Make romance a part of your daily life.",How to Spice Up Your Relationship2," Though you may have been in the same relationship for five or twenty-five years, that's no excuse for you to lounge around in your pajamas until it's time to go out for dinner.

Get naughty with food.,
Talk naughty.,
Watch something naughty.,
Be spontaneous.",How to Spice Up Your Relationship3," The right food can make your relationship and your sex life naughtier and much more exciting. Don't be afraid to get naughty with your favorite sexy foods. Here are some tricks to try:


If you're a girl, have your man pour some wine on your chest and lick it off.
Suck on a popsicle, mint, or an ice cube and then either kiss or pleasure your significant other. Enjoy the new sensation.
Eat when you're naked. If you're eating sexy foods, like fruits and chocolate, this will get you more in the mood.
Have dessert for dinner. Put it in naughty parts of your body and have your significant other eat it off of you.
Put little chocolates on your significant other's naked body and eat it off. Don't use your hands — only your mouth.

, Dirty talk can help you feel more excited and will put some of the spice back into your relationship. Whether you're giving your lover some dirty talk under the sheets or if you're texting or talking on the phone, dirty talk can help put you in the mood for doing the dirty.


Be naughty on the phone. Tell your honey what you wish he could do to you. Plan a meeting so you can make your fantasies a reality, or have some phone sex.
Talk dirty before any foreplay. The right words will turn your partner on before you even start kissing.
Talk dirty when you're making love. Let your honey know how you feel and how much you love his body.
Send naughty texts. Send sexy messages that tell your sweetie that you can't wait to hook up later. Be as graphic as you want. Just make sure he's not in a place where someone else can read your texts.

, Watching sexy stuff with your honey will get you in the mood faster than you can take your shirt off. It may feel a little strange at first, but watching other people get turned on will not only turn you on, but it will also give you some great love-making ideas in the process.


Watch a sexy movie together, like 9 1/2 weeks or Wild Orchids.
Watch some sexy raunchy television. Watching people make out, touch each other, or even make love on television will get you in the mood.
Be old fashioned. Look at sexy pictures together. That was how people got turned on in the days before porn.
If you're up for it, watch some porn together.

, Your relationship will be more exciting if you know that you can hook up at any moment. Though it's important to plan date night and to make a conscious effort to communicate and spend more time together, it's also important not to plan too much.


Whisk your honey away in the middle of the day and check in to a hotel to make love. Don't tell him where you're really going until the last minute.
If you want to have sex, go for it. Unless your honey is really not feeling it, if the urge strikes, don't be afraid to hook up.
Kiss when you're feeling passionate. Kissing can spice up your relationship just as much as sex. If you're in the mood, kiss your honey or move in for a make out session in an unexpected place.
Plan a surprise trip. Pack your bags and drive your partner off into the sunset. You'll be able to communicate and have a great conversation when you drive there, and to have amazing and surprising sex once you arrive.
If you're in a place where you just can't get it on, take your partner by the hand and lead him home. Tell him, ""I want you. Now."" Then race to the bedroom for some hot sex.

When in doubt, keep things simple with one- or two- word closings.,
Use a ""-ly"" closing.,
Go for humor.,
Be sincere.,
If you're bold, don't be afraid to get sappy or affectionate.,
Use an inside joke.,
Try cursive.,
Add hearts and ""love"" symbols wherever you can.,
Try big, illuminated letters.,
If typing, try a dramatic font.,
Omit your name for an anonymous note.,
End in a different language.,
Draw a picture next to your closing.,
Include clippings or other personal objects.",How to Sign a Love Letter," The closing or sign off is the part of the letter right before your name where you basically say ""goodbye."" Common examples include ""Love,"" ""Sincerely,"" ""Best,"" and so on. If you're having trouble thinking of what to say, consider going for a closing that's short and sweet. There's much to be said for the sweetness of a simple, sincere end to the letter.Ideas: ""Love,"" ""Yours,"" ""With love,"" ""Always,"" ""Be well,""

Use when: You want to come across as elegant. You want to end simply — classically. You are in a long-term relationship and sappier endings seem ""fake.""

Don't use when: You want to come across as creative. You are bursting with emotion and you want this to come across on the page. Your partner has complained that you are ""too distant."";
, One common way to close a letter is with a single word ending in ""-ly"" — an adverb.At the end of a letter, these words are usually used to describe the way you feel as you write the letter or wait for a reply. For love letters, you'll usually want to choose ""-ly"" words that emphasize how much you care about the person you're writing to or how excited you are to get a reply.



Ideas: ""Devotedly,"" ""Unquestioningly,"" ""Truly,"" ""Faithfully,""

Use when: You want an easy way to be descriptive about how you feel.

Don't use when: You're early on in a relationship. This can seem a little cliched or overly-formal.

, Don't want your letter to be a stiff, serious bore? A little levity can turn a love letter from a dull affair into something that's a joy to read. In this case, the sign-off is your ""closing shot."" In other words, it's your last chance to get a laugh out of your reader, so be sure to end on a high note!



Ideas: ""L8rz,"" ""Toodles,"" ""With intestinal distress,"" ""Yours, I guess,"" ""Man, I'm pretty,""

Use when: You want to cheer your partner up. You want to make things between you lighthearted and fun. This method can lead to immediate happy emotions and it takes some of the pressure off of you for making your letter ""perfect.""

Don't use when: You can't think of anything funny to say. Your partner is worried that you aren't taking the relationship seriously. You've just had an argument.

, Love letters offer rare chances to communicate exactly what's on your mind when it comes to how you feel about someone. They're one of the only places where it's even a little appropriate to be this frank, so if you feel like your emotions speak for themselves, you may want to use your closing as an opportunity to bare your heart.



Ideas: ""I have never felt this way before,"" ""I need you,"" ""You're the only one,"" ""You complete me,""

Use when: You're confident you and your partner have a powerful emotional bond.

Don't use when: You arent 100% sure how serious your relationship is. This can be very embarrassing and awkward if your reader doesn't feel the same way.

, A love letter is a good place to be openly affectionate with someone who you know feels the same way about you as you do about him or her. However, this is best reserved for people you've already started some kind of relationship with. Don't use these for your very first declaration of love — you can risk really creeping your reader out.



Ideas: ""Your Smooshums,"" ""XOXOXO,"" ""Snuggles,"" ""Smooches,""

Use when: You want to come across as warm, heartfelt, or funny. Your partner needs cheering up.

Don't use when: Your partner has complained about you being too clingy. You want your partner to take you more seriously.

, A great way to show that you've put some serious thought into your letter is to pick a closing that only you and your reader could possibly get. Not only is this a good opportunity to be funny, but also a way to build some instant camaraderie with the person that you want to make a romantic connection with.



Ideas: ""Would you like some fries with that?"" ""Don't forget to file those TPS reports,"" ""Not too shabby,""

Use when: You want to come across as funny and creative. You want to show that you're putting mental effort into your relationship. You want to remind your partner of a great time you had together.

Don't use when: You don't have very many memories with your partner yet. This can seem bizarre if your reader doesn't ""get"" the joke.

, The ""classic"" love letter is a breathless, passionate note scrawled with a plume or a fountain pen on parchment. While it's pretty difficult to create this sort of Romeo and Juliet letter today, you can still give your letter a little bit of old-fashioned charm by writing your closing in cursive. Big, loopy, dramatic letters can call to mind the star-crossed lovers of past centuries for an oh-so-romantic effect.


Need a refresher on how to write in cursive? See our cursive guide for step-by-step help and sample documents.
If you're going to write your name in cursive, you may want to carefully write each letter out instead of quickly scrawling your signature in. You don't want your reader not to recognize your name.

, Show your feelings for your reader (and score some cuteness points at the same time) by sprinkling adorable symbols of love throughout your closing. Hearts are the most obvious symbol, but, depending on how far you want to go, you can try drawing male/female symbols, wedding rings, roses, and more — it's all up to you.


There's no ""right"" way to do this, but one common trick is to draw a small heart wherever you'd normally dot a lowercase ""i"" or ""j"".

, If you have the time and energy, you can score major points for effort by using your closing as a chance to show off your inner artist. Draw each letter (or, if you're in a rush, just the first) as a detailed, elaborate picture. You can include plants, animals, or other drawings as part of each illuminated letter — it's up to you!


See this guide for a quick to the sorts of medieval letter drawings that established this sort of tradition (with pictures)., Not all letters are handwritten. In fact, today, the vast majority of letters are made with some sort of help from a computer. This doesn't mean that you have to settle for plain text standbys like Times New Roman, however. Try using a more eye-catching font for your closing to add creativity and beauty to your letter — most word processors come with at least a few interesting fonts.


Here are a just a few fonts included with recent editions of Office that you may want to use:Blackadder, Bradley Hand, Brush Script, Colonna, Kunstler Script, Parchment, Vivaldi Italic.
You can also download fonts online if you can't find any that you like. For example, 1001fonts.com offers over 200 cursive fonts alone., Looking for a truly unique closing to your love letter? The outside-the-box suggestions in this section can help you make your letter even more enticing. For example, you may want to consider leaving no name at all on your letter. This can leave your reader wracking his or her brain trying to find out who the note was from — you can reveal yourself when you're ready.


One variation on this is to write your letter as normal, then cut your name out. Keep this slip of paper and give it to your reader a day or two later as a surprise.

, Do you know a language besides English? Using this for your closing can give your letter an unexpected, exotic twist ending. You may try simply translating a normal closing into your language of choice, using a figure of speech from the second language, or something else entirely.


Omniglot, an online language encyclopedia, has translations of ""I love you"" for many different languages here.Bonus points if your second language is Italian or French — the ""languages of love.""

, There doesn't have to be a ""reason"" for the things you include in your closing. If you're a decent artist and you think of something that would look cool next to your closing, feel free to draw it in. Most people will appreciate the time and effort that goes into a detailed sketch, so give it a shot, even if it doesn't make perfect sense in the context of the letter. Here are some things you may want to draw:


Animals (ideally ones your reader likes)
Plants (see above)
Crests/emblems (real or imaginary)
Cartoons/comics/doodles
Portraits of you or your reader (use caution — if this is your very first love letter to this person, this can come across as ""too much"")

, Another thing you may want to add at the end of your letter is something special just for him or her — in other words, a gift. This can be almost anything, but we've included a few ideas below that are easy to paste or slip into the space next to your closing at the end of your letter.


Magazine clippings that have personal meaning
Leaf or flower pressings from an outdoor spot the two of you enjoy visiting
Poetry passages
Fortune cookie slips
Movie or event tickets from something you attended together
Photos of you, your reader, or both of you

Listen.,
Pay her a simple compliment.,

Be respectful.",How to Show Your Girlfriend How Much You Care (for Guys)1," Don't assume your girlfriend knows how you feel about her. Be sure to tell her exactly how you feel. Ambiguity leads to uncertainty, and that can put a strain on your relationship.;
, You are her confidant, so be sure to listen to everything she has to say. Help her unwind by talking through any problems she had. Empathize with her, share her highs and lows. This will help bond you together.

, The importance of listening in a relationship cannot be stressed enough.


Even if what she is saying is boring to you, pay attention because it isn't boring to her.
Learn to listen ""between the lines"" and infer what you can do to help her.
Listening shows that you are invested in her life, and will build her trust.

, Always be sincere, because it will be obvious when you're not being truthful.


Let her know that she's especially vibrant today.
When she changes her hairstyle, praise the new look.
Compliment her on something that she did in class/at work.
Make a positive comment about the clothes she is wearing.

, If you don't trust your girlfriend, she's not going to trust you back. Every good relationship is based on a solid foundation of trust.


If she's going out with friends, don't call or text her every twenty minutes. Allow her to have fun without you.
Avoid jealousy. Let her talk to other guys without you jumping in the conversation and getting defensive. Just because you are dating doesn't mean she can only talk to you.

, Always treat her with the utmost respect, even when you're fighting.

Be honest with him.,
Avoid picking fights with him.,
Admit when you’re wrong.,
Use “honest” words.,
Learn to compromise.,
Support his dreams.",How to Show Your Boyfriend That You Love Him and Only Him1," Mentally engaging conversations with lots of open-ended questions show you care. Speak off the cuff and from the heart. This will show him you trust him and that he can trust you.You can ask about his day, interests, or family. Deep conversations don’t have to be things like the meaning of life or about politics.
You can ask questions about things he's said in the past to show you remember what he says. Try saying things like, ""How are your family? How is your mother's health?"" or ""I haven't heard you talk about gardening lately. How are your vegetables doing?"" You may also say, ""I saw a commercial for a tropical vacation. It made me think about you and how you want to have your big adventure vacation."";
, One great way to show your boyfriend that you love him is to listen to him. Sometimes, he will need your undivided attention as he talks about random things. These things may not mean anything to you or seem pointless, but they mean something to him. Listening to him can help you both feel connected and shows him how much you care for him.When you talk to him, make sure to make eye contact and watch him. Really listen to what he says. You may want to repeat things, ask questions, or add ideas to what he says.
Put away electronic devices so that your attention is completely focused on him.

, Guys often want to feel appreciated and masculine, which helps their self-esteem. You can help show him your love by complimenting him and praising him. Make sure your praise is genuine and not fake, which can backfire and cause problems in the relationship.Find ways to compliment and praise his manliness. For example, you can comment on something he made or did around the house, or a project he finished at work.

, Focus on building an honest, open relationship with your boyfriend. Keeping secrets and hiding things can come between you. If you’re hiding something, he might eventually find out and lose trust in you. Always be open and honest with him.Even if he doesn’t find out what you’re keeping from him, your guilty conscience could eat away at you and make you feel miserable.

, Arguments are part of a healthy relationship, but picking fights with him for no apparent reason doesn’t encourage a good relationship or show that you love him. As far as he knows, a fight could give you an excuse to leave him and meet someone else. Unfaithful partners also pick fights as a result of guilt. If you love only him, don't give him a reason to think otherwise.Learn the rules of “fair fighting.” Speak calmly without raising your voice too much. Make sure you attack issues and not him. Give him a chance to speak and listen to what he has to say. For example, if he's done something that hurts your feelings, explain why his action was wrong without calling him names.For example, you may say, ""The way you treated me in that situation really hurt my feelings"" instead of ""You always ignore me and never want to be with me!"" You can also say, ""Your words were harsh and upset me"" instead of ""You are such a jerk! You are always mean to me!""

, This is a strong sign of honesty and loyalty. Everyone slips up, and you’re no exception. If you know you've hurt him, admit it and apologize. Afterward, don’t dwell on it or constantly revisit the subject with him. However, you should make an effort to learn from your mistake., Speak in the first-person (I, me) to show that you're honest with your feelings and thoughts. When you use “I” words, you show that you're not ashamed to associate yourself with the topic. Keeping the focus on yourself also shows him that you're not trying to blame him for anything.Try saying, ""I was hurt by your actions last night,"" ""I did not appreciate the way you spoke to me in front of your friends,"" or ""I feel like I have been treated unfairly by you.""

, Compromise is an important part of any serious relationship. It’s a way you can show him you love him. When there are things he wants to do but you aren’t interested in, you can compromise and go anyway. He’ll know you don’t really want to do it, but he’ll know you love him because of your willingness to do things for him.When you agree to do something, don’t talk about how you don’t want to be there the whole time. Instead, enjoy being with him, even if the event or activity isn’t your thing.
Make sure he compromises and does things for you, too. Compromising for each other is part of a healthy relationship.

, Just as you have have your dreams, your boyfriend has dreams. Some of these dreams may never be achievable, but everyone needs things to think about and hope for. Don’t shoot down his dreams, but encourage him. Dream with him, and maybe the two of your can come up with your own dreams together.For example, his dream may be to hike up an exotic mountain. Don’t tell him he can’t do it, or that he won’t have the money or time. Instead, say things like, “That would be so much fun!” or “You should try to save up for that adventure one day.”

Get them tickets to something they like.",How to Show Someone You Love Them1," It may seem cliché or overdone, but nothing says ""I love you"" like a beautiful bunch of flowers, especially if they're her (or his) favorite. Make sure they are presented nicely. Attach a romantic note or send them anonymously. Present them in person or have them delivered to your loved one's home or office building. Flowers are a classic romantic gift that will never go out of fashion.


Try to make sure that you send flowers that your partner likes. Sure, it's the thought that counts, but you'll get extra points for choosing the right flowers. If you don't know their favorite varieties and want to go for something classic instead, you really can't go wrong with red roses.;
, Make your loved one a mix CD of the songs that remind you of them or your relationship, or even songs you just think they would like. Maybe ask them innocently to find their taste. A mix CD is a great gift because it shows you put time and consideration into finding music they would like.

, Buy or make a coupon book that you can give to your loved one, with coupons they can cash in for romantic activities at any time.

Think of things like a coupon for a romantic dinner, a coupon for one hundred kisses, or a coupon for a sensual massage.
Alternatively, they could be coupons for everyday activities such as a passes on doing the dishes or walking the dog, even if it's their turn. This isn't as romantic, but your partner will surely appreciate them nonetheless.

, Frame a picture of you and your loved one together. Pick a photograph where the two of you look happy and and are clearly enjoying each other's company. Give it to your loved one and tell them why you chose that particular picture and what memories it brings back. Their heart might just melt a little.


Before framing, date the picture and perhaps write a little note on the back. Then choose a pretty frame, and wrap it in a box or just tie a ribbon around it.
Make sure it's a photo of themselves that they like. They won't want to display it if they have something in their teeth or their eyes are half closed. Present it in a pretty frame.

, If you're looking for something cute and fun to give your loved one, consider a bunch of balloons. Balloons are over-the-top and attention grabbing, so if you're looking to make a big statement, this is it. Just watch their face when they see you coming, it'll be priceless.


Choose a bunch with your partner's favorite colors and tie with vivid ribbons. The louder the better.
Make sure to get helium balloons, they look happier than the non-floating type.

, Surprise your loved one by getting them tickets to see something they like, whether it's tickets to see their favorite band or tickets to a movie they've been wanting to see, or tickets to a sports event. This gift shows that you listen to your partner, that you support their interests and that you would do anything to make them happy.


You'll need to be selfless with this one - even if it's something that bores you to tears, like ballet or monster trucks. The point is that it's something they like.
Make sure their schedule is free before you buy the tickets. Even if they appreciate the thought, it'll be disappointing if they're not able to make it.

Write her a love note.,
Don't ever forget to say that you love her because she will never forget the moment you explained your love to her.

,
Get in touch with her before bed.,
Surprise her with a sweet treat.,
Give her flowers.,
Give a simple gift.,
Show affection when she least expects it.",How to Show Your Girlfriend How Much You Care (for Guys)2," A written note shows her that you care enough to share your feelings with her. Make sure it is handwritten; don't type and print a note! Here are some starters:


""I've been thinking about you all day...""
""I wish I could be there with you, but this note will have to do...""
""I can't wait until I see you next...""
Place the note where it will have the most impact. Ideally, finding the note should be a surprise. For example, if you know she has to read certain pages of a book for school, place it between those pages. If you are sleeping together, write a note on the bathroom mirror with soap, or place a love note on her nightstand.

,, Call or text her when she's getting ready to go to sleep. This is known as the ""tuck in call,"" and it is a very powerful way to show her you care.


The tuck in call lets her know that she's on your mind.
You will be the last thing she thinks about before falling asleep.
It gives her someone to talk with about any of the problems she may have had that day, which will help her sleep better.

,


Chocolates range from the cheap to the quite expensive. You don't have to spend an arm and a leg, but avoid just giving her a bar from the candy aisle. Look for boutique chocolates and remember that a little goes a long way.
Imported candies are a fancy way to show that you care about her, and can be exciting to try. They're not terribly expensive either.
Bake her some cookies. This shows thoughtfulness as well as adeptness in the kitchen.
If she doesn't like sweets, surprise her with her favorite snack.

, This is one of the most traditional ways to show affection, and is very effective. They are bright and cheery, and the freshness is a vitalizing gift. Flowers can get expensive, however, so save them for truly special occasions.


Most supermarkets have bouquets available for less than $20.
If you know your girlfriend's favorite colors or flowers, talk to a florist and have them help you design a bouquet.
If you have access to wildflowers, pick and make her one yourself. Just be sure that you don't cut someone's private flowers.
If your girlfriend is having a bad day at the office, have some flowers delivered. This can be expensive, but it shows you care and she can show off to her coworkers.
A single flower can be just as good as a whole bouquet. It's the gesture of giving that is the most important.

, A surprise gift can spice up a normally dull day and really let her know that you're thinking of her. Some suggestions:


Love coupons. Give her a set of coupons that she can redeem to get you to do things for her. For example, romantic dinners, movie night, hugs and kisses on demand, etc.
An accessory. Clothes can be expensive, but a nice accessory can make a great gift and not break the bank. Look for hats, scarves, or handbags.
A bottle of wine and a pair of wineglasses.

, Catch her off guard and you'll make a much more lasting impact.


Sneak up on her while she's working and give her a quick kiss.
Give her an extra hug before she heads off to work or school.
Pull her in closer while walking together on a cold day.
Take her hand while walking out in public.

Get to know her friends and family.,
Plan a treasure hunt.,
Cook her a meal.,
Make her a Mix CD/Playlist.,
Plan a picnic.",How to Show Your Girlfriend How Much You Care (for Guys)3," Do everything in your power to get along and be friendly with these people. They are an important part of your girlfriend's life, and you should demonstrate that you respect that. This will let your girlfriend know that you are serious when it comes to your relationship.

, This can be a fun way to spend an afternoon, and the thought and planning that goes into it will show her that you really care.


First, come up with the treasure. This can be almost anything, from a piece of jewelry to a nice dinner out, or something more personal.
Plan the hunt. Decide how long you want the hunt to be, and where you want it to take place. Common stops for romantic hunts include ""the first place we met,"" or ""our first dinner together.""
Write the notes. Place the first one where you know she'll find it. Write something like ""I have a little game for you to play, you can find the next note at .""
Don't make the hunt too difficult, this is supposed to be fun!

, Not only does this make for a good date, it shows that you know your way around the kitchen. Don't worry too much about messing up, the thought matters much more than the execution.


Plan your meal. Find some simple recipes that don't have too many steps. Try to time your preparations so that all the items are ready at the same time.
Make sure the meal is balanced. Include a vegetable side, and don't serve huge portions.
Pasta is usually a safe choice, as it is fairly easy to cook and most people will enjoy it.
The dining area should be cleaned before dinner. Light a candle or two and make sure that all the dinnerware is placed correctly.
If you're old enough, serve dinner with a modest bottle of wine.

,


The concept of the Mix CD goes way back to the days of Mix Tapes. Basically, you want to collect songs that you feel she will enjoy, as well as songs that show how you feel about her. Memory is heavily influenced by music, and a good Mix CD will be remembered for a long time.
Create the track list. You want her to be able to listen to the whole thing without getting bored or skipping tracks. Make sure that the first song grabs her attention, and that the subsequent songs flow well.
Most music software will let you burn CD's. Check here for specific instructions on how to burn the CD
If she uses a service like iTunes or Spotify, you can create a digital playlist and share it with her. This will allow you to make a playlist longer than a CD allows, but the lack of a tangible item can make the gift seem a little less special.

, Similar to cooking her a meal, planning a picnic shows that you care about her and that you think ahead.


Make sure the weather is good. Forecasts change all the time, so be ready to change plans if the day before it starts pouring down rain.
Prepare a light lunch. A picnic should be a light and airy affair, and the food should reflect that. Make sandwiches, slice up some fruit, and pack a bag of light chips. For drinks, brew some ice tea.
Take the picnic somewhere fun. Depending on your location, find a place that boasts a lot of natural beauty. Riversides, beaches, and meadows all make good picnic locations. Scout the place out ahead of time and look for secluded locations.

Do small thoughtful things for your boyfriend.,
Be physically affectionate with your boyfriend.,
Keep your affection at a reasonable level.,
Be confident.,
Keep your promises.,
Trust him.,
Make him feel important to you.,
Show him you’re thinking of him.,
Dress up for him.",How to Show Your Boyfriend That You Love Him and Only Him2," You can show your boyfriend that you love him by doing small things for him randomly. You can bring him a cup of coffee or his favorite beverage in the mornings, buy his favorite snacks, or do something nice for him when he’s having a bad day.Think of ways you can show that you pay attention to him or care. Cook his favorite meal for him when he’s feeling down, wear his favorite outfit of yours, or surprise him with a Saturday trip to his favorite place.

, One of the best ways to show your boyfriend you love him is to be affectionate. Kissing and hugging are two ways couples nonverbally show their feelings for each other. You can also hold hands, cuddle, or touch each other as you talk.Of course, it's perfectly normal for things to cool down after you've been together for a few years. Don’t stop hugging or kissing him before you go home after a date. Continue to cuddle on the couch as you watch TV. However, if you suddenly stop being affectionate, he might think you're losing interest in him.

, You should be affectionate and buy your boyfriend cute things on special occasions. However, you should avoid acting extremely lovey-dovey or buying him things for no reason. Showing him that he's the only one doesn't mean smothering him.


Additionally, going overboard with affection may make him think that you are making up for something you feel guilty about.

, If your guy is like most modern guys, he appreciates a smart and confident partner. When you let your confidence shine, you remind him of why he fell in love with you in the first place. You also show that you have the self-esteem that many unfaithful partners lack.Express your confidence by speaking up for yourself (calmly) when he’s hurt you. Being a doormat is not part of true love and loyalty., Unforeseen circumstances are one thing. If you had to break tonight's date because you developed a migraine after lunch, that’s understandable. On the other hand, if you repeatedly break dates because “something came up,” you'll only show him that he can't count on you., It’s okay to feel a tinge of jealousy if he looks at a potential rival. However, if he’s not flirting with others, ignoring you, or receiving suspicious texts, you shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Cheaters often accuse their partners of being unfaithful when they have no evidence. Don’t give him a reason to think you might be messing around., Never forget his importance in your life. Let him know you’re happy to be with him. Compliment him, do nice things for him, and tell him you love him. These small gestures can make him feel loved.Avoid talking too much about cute celebrities or your ex. Even if he knows you’ll never meet or run into them again, talking too much about potential rivals could make him feel neglected.

, Send him an occasional text or email professing your love. Leave sweet love notes for him from time to time. This will reassure him that you’re thinking of him and no one else while you’re apart., Looking extra special when you go out can remind your boyfriend just how much you love him. It doesn’t matter how long you have been together. Putting effort into how you look occasionally helps remind him about one of the reasons why he fell for you and that you love him enough to put work into your appearance for him.For example, put on clothes you know he thinks are sexy, groom yourself, put on his favorite scent, and do something with your hair.
It’s easy to get comfortable when you’ve been together, but dressing up can spice things up for both of you.

Encourage him to spend time with his friends.,
Focus on him instead of social media.,
Treat his friends with respect.,
Don’t cheat.",How to Show Your Boyfriend That You Love Him and Only Him3," Being together is not the only way you can show that you love him. Your boyfriend needs his friends and to enjoy things outside of you and the relationship. By encouraging him to go out with his friends, you are showing him that you love him and trust him. Plus, when he returns, you can remind him that you love him and only him by telling him how much you missed him.Don’t get upset or angry if he wants to go watch a game with his friends. Time apart is good for you both, as is spending time with your friends.
Make sure the time with his friends is realistic. Your boyfriend shouldn’t expect you to never see your friends while he sees his. He should also not skip out of responsibilities you share to hang out with his friends.

, Your relationship should involve spending a lot of time together. When you go on dates, eat dinner, or watch television, stay present in the moment. Enjoy the activity and talk to one another. Leave your cell phone and social media accounts alone for a little while. This will show him you love only him and not people online.It’s okay to spend an hour or so tweeting about the issues of the day, but there’s also a time to call it quits. If you spend time on social media while he's right there with you, you'll make him feel unloved. Rather than checking your phone throughout your date, focus on him. Social media will still be there tomorrow.

, Be friendly and respectful to his friends. It is important that you form good relationships with his friends because they are important to your boyfriend. However, you shouldn’t flirt with them. If you really love your boyfriend, you will be friendly with his friends but nothing more. Instead, focus your affection on your boyfriend while you are with his friends to remind him he's the only one for you.This will hurt their friendship and put you under suspicion. It’s okay to offer a friendly hug after you’ve gotten to know them, but softly grazing their arms or standing too close are red flags for flirting. Behavior like this will make your guy think twice about your loyalty.

, This should go without saying. If you truly love your guy and only him, you won’t go behind his back with someone else. Remain faithful to show him he’s the only one in your heart.

Make small gestures.,
Be affectionate.,
Share with them.,
Trust them.,
Surprise them.,
Cook for them.,
Be honest.,
Encourage them to pursue their dreams.,
Be there for them.",How to Show Someone You Love Them2," Sometimes love isn't about making grand statements or over-the-top gestures, it's about the little, everyday things that define a relationship. Try doing things like opening a door for your loved one, bringing them their morning cup of coffee in bed or sending a quick text to let them know you're thinking about them throughout the day.

, A soft kiss. A warm hug. Even a tender squeeze of the hand. These little displays of affection are the perfect way to communicate your love without saying a word.

, There's no room for selfishness when it comes to love. If you really care about someone, you'll share your thoughts, your blanket and even your last slice of pizza with them.

, You've heard it before, but there can be no love without trust. You need to trust your partner to make the right decisions, even when you're not around. It doesn't matter if it's trusting them when they say that nothing happened with their ex, or trusting them not to burn the dinner you left on the stove, you need to take them at their word.

, No matter how much you love someone, relationships can become boring if you allow yourselves to fall into a routine. Rekindle the spark by doing something spontaneous. Surprise your loved one by sending them flowers, calling them unexpectedly or planning a romantic getaway for the two of you.

, Whether it's a bang-up bacon and egg breakfast or a gourmet, ethnic-themed feast, show your love by feeding your special someone something delicious. The time and effort you put into it will be obvious to your loved one, while eating together will allow you to spend some quality time with each other. They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach - but a tasty meal works equally well for either gender.

, As mentioned already, trust is the key to a healthy relationship, and there can be no trust without honesty. You should tell your partner the truth about everything - whether you ate the last cookie or left the front door unlocked.


There are, however, a number of notable exceptions to this rule. Providing answers to the questions ""does this make me look fat?"" and ""what do you think of my parents?"" being two such exceptions.

, If you truly love someone, you'll want them to be the best that they can be and to pursue their dreams no matter the consequences. Don't hold them back for your own selfish reasons - they'll only end up resenting you for it. If they want to learn the violin, put up with their ear-splitting practice sessions (or invest in a pair of earplugs.) If they want to study or work abroad, figure out a way to make the relationship work. They say love is about compromise, but nobody should have to sacrifice their dreams.

, To really show someone you love them, be there for them through thick and thin. Share their joy and their pain. Celebrate with them when they get a promotion at work or help them through the death of a beloved family member. Being there for someone can be as simple as sharing a drink together at the end of the week, or as important as giving them a shoulder to cry on when they're feeling low.

"
Send a letter.,
Thank them.,
Tell them they're beautiful/handsome.,
Ask them how they are - and listen to the answer.,
Ask for their advice.,
Say you're sorry.,
Write a romantic song or poem.,
Tell them you love them.",How to Show Someone You Love Them3," If you can't say the words out loud, try putting your feelings in a letter. Some people find that they can express themselves much better in writing than they can in person. Pour your heart into a letter, mail it and have them read it when you're not around.


Include details like why you were attracted to them in the first place, how you feel when you're around them, and how you envision your future together.
An email would also work, but there's something old-fashioned and romantic about a letter.

, Showing your loved one a little appreciation now and then can go a long way. A smile and a quick ""thank you"" will do for the little things, but every so often you should sit them down, look them in the eye and tell them ""I really appreciate everything you do for me, it means a lot."" Thanking your loved one will make them feel needed and appreciated, which is important for any relationship.

, Everyone likes to hear that the person they're with finds them attractive. Don't just assume they know how handsome or beautiful you think they are - tell them!


Try an over-the-top compliment like ""You're the most gorgeous man on the planet."" It will make them feel special and let them know that you only have eyes for them.
Or tell them something simple and sincere like ""I can spot your smile from across the room"" or ""your eyes are the most beautiful shade of blue, I could stare at them all day.""

, This sounds simple, but its importance cannot be understated. In order to feel loved, a person needs to feel listened to and understood. It's easy to ask a person how they are out of habit, and not really listen to the answer. You should make a point of sitting down with your loved one and asking them to tell you how they're doing - honestly and sincerely. If they're perfectly happy - great, let them know that you are too. If they're not doing so well, ask what you can do to help or just lend them a sympathetic ear.

, Asking your loved one for advice shows that you care about and respect their opinion. It shows that you value their input and that you understand the importance of making decisions together, especially if a decision affects the two of you.


If they have more knowledge on a certain topic, asking for their advice will flatter their ego, while also being beneficial to you, for example, when buying a car or new laptop.
Ask for their advice on something relatively unimportant like whether you should buy the new Playstation or Xbox. They may not care all that much, but they'll appreciate you asking.
For more serious matters, such as medical procedures or living arrangements, asking for your partners input is definitely recommended. If you fail to let them in on big decisions such as these, they may feel left out or unappreciated.

, Know when you're wrong and admit it. Whether you broke their favorite mug or made an underhand comment during an argument, a genuine, unconditional apology can go a long way to resolving the situation and letting your partner know you care.


Refusing to say you're sorry will only cause tension and resentment. Even if you think you did nothing wrong, swallow your pride and say the words. Your relationship is worth it.

, What could be more romantic than sharing your feelings through a song or poem? (Hint: nothing). Through the words of a song or poem you can express all the sweet sentiments and warm, fuzzy feelings that you can't say to their face. Send your song recording or poem anonymously by mail for added romance factor.


If you're not so creative, find some romantic words written by someone else and send your loved ones those instead. Look for romantic poems or letters written by great writers, such as Shakespeare, Lord Byron or Emily Dickinson.
Alternatively, try dedicating a song to them. Whether it's before you sing on karaoke night or calling a request in to their favorite radio station, a song dedication is always romantic.

, This might sound a little crazy, but you could just say it out loud, those three little words: ""I love you."" Say it at the movies, say it in bed, say it while you're dancing, say it over dinner, say it on the phone. It doesn't matter where or when, as long as you mean it.

"
Send her flowers.,
Cook her favorite dinner.,
Write her a love letter.,
Take her out.,
Compliment her.,
Surprise her.,
Tell her you love her.",How to Show a Girl You Love Her1," It may seem clichéd, but nothing says ""I love you"" like a beautiful bunch of flowers. However, you should try to put a little effort into it - don't just pick up the first bunch that's on sale at the supermarket. Go the extra mile by finding out from friends or family what type of flowers are her favorite and have them specially delivered to her home.


For added romance, you can attach a romantic note to the flowers. It can be something short and sweet like ""beautiful flowers for a beautiful girl"" or something a little lengthier, like a romantic quote from a poem or song.
If you're short on cash, don't worry. You don't need to buy the most expensive, imported flowers available. In fact, a single red rose or a freshly-picked bunch of wildflowers can be infinitely more romantic than a generic, pre-arranged bouquet.;
, You can show a girl you love her by investing a little time and effort into something that will make her happy, like cooking her favorite dinner. If you've been seeing her for a while, you should have a pretty good idea of what she likes. Just don't go for anything too complicated if you've never made it before. Make the meal extra romantic by setting the table nicely, lighting some candles and playing some mood music in the background.


You can choose to let her know what you're planning and tell her to dress nicely for dinner or you can take her completely by surprise - just make sure she'll be home on time and that she'll definitely come home alone!
Don't worry if you're not a master chef, it's really the thought that counts. However, if you're worried about the food being at least edible, you can try practicing your dish on family or friends first.
If you can't afford to take her out to a restaurant, and you don't know how to cook, ask to cook with her! Partners that do everyday things together have more fun and will be together longer. Try opening up the recipe book and baking together.

, Writing a love letter is a truly romantic way to show a girl you love her and is something she can cherish forever. This is an especially good option if you have difficulty verbalizing your feelings - all you need to do is whip out a pen and let your heart do the talking. You can give the letter to her in person or send it by mail for extra surprise factor.


Take inspiration from the words of great writers such as Shakespeare, Lord Byron or Emily Dickinson if you have difficulty getting started, or look up some famous, romantic quotes that you can incorporate into your letter.
You could also write her a nice email or text message, but there's nothing like snail mail for a bit of old-fashioned romance.
Alternatively, if you want to get even more creative you could try putting your feelings into a song or a poem. You could sing the song in person or record it and send it to her if you're feeling a little shy. If you play an instrument already, even better!

, Take some initiative and plan out a whole romantic evening for the two of you. You could go the classic route of dinner and a movie, or you could try to personalize the experience by recreating your first date or taking her to the place where the two of you first met. The time and effort required to plan out a really special for the two of you will speak for itself and she'll know how much you care.


Try to think about her interests rather than your own - for example, you shouldn't take her bowling if you know she'd really prefer to go ice skating.
Try to come up with some creative ideas, based on her interests and hobbies. If she's outgoing, take her hiking or paint-balling. If she likes to have fun, take her to a theme park or arcade. If she's more into music or drama, get tickets to see a band or a play.

, This is an easy one. If you really love this girl it should be no problem to find 101 things you like about her and can compliment her on. You can compliment her on her appearance: whether it's something she prides herself on, like her long, shiny hair or amazing green eyes, or something that she feels self-conscious about, like her curves or crooked smile. You shouldn't just focus on her appearance though, you should also compliment her on her best personality traits or something she's done well on.


For example, you could tell her that you love her kind heart and the way she's always doing things for others, or compliment her on what a great job she did at a recent sports event or on a particular homework assignment.
Compliments should always be sincere. If you tell her something that's not true, she may be able to tell that the compliment is fake and the whole thing will backfire completely. Keep it genuine and heartfelt.

, Surprises are a great way to show a girl that you've been thinking about her and that you're willing to do anything just to make her smile. You don't need to plan a massive party or buy her a puppy or anything (though these ideas may work in certain circumstances!) A surprise can be as simple as showing up at her house with a tub of ice cream and her favorite DVD when she's had a bad day, or leaving a little note in her purse or under her pillow to find when she's least expecting it.


Some girls aren't too fond of surprises, so if you're unsure about something you're planning, try to sneakily suss out her feelings or slip her some subtle hints before you do anything too crazy.
This step only counts if it's a good surprise - it's not advisable to show up with a tattoo of her face on your forearm or the news that you're moving to another state. These type of surprises typically don't go down so well.

, Well, duh. If you really love this girl, the easiest, most straight-forward way to show her is just to tell her. You don't need to make a big song and dance about it, or trail a banner with the words ""I love you"" from an airplane, you simply need to take a moment when the two of you are sharing an intimate moment alone and say those three little words, seriously and sincerely.


If the exact words ""I love you"" are a little too scary or intense, try saying something to the same effect, such as ""I think I'm falling for you"" or something cheesy like ""you've completely stolen my heart"". She'll get the idea.
If it's your first time to say it, don't be too disheartened if she doesn't say it back right away. She may just need a little more time to process the information. Remember that ""I love you"" is not a question that demands an answer.
On the other hand, she might be completely over the moon that you've finally mustered up the courage to tell her how you feel and jump at the opportunity to return the words she's been longing to hear. You'll never know until you go for it!

Slow down.,
Be a good listener.,
Look at body language.",How to Show Love Through Observation1," If you want to get better at observation, slow down. Take your time to notice things about the people around you. You might notice the things you really like about them like their smile, laughter, or sense of humor. Find the things you love about them, then let them know. For example, you might notice how good your child is with the dog or how your spouse plays with the kids. Take time for these observations. Stop multitasking and start zooming in on what’s going on around you.Spend some time each day with someone you love and observe them. See what they’re good at, note their passions and dreams, and reflect on how these things shape who they are. Then, take the time to share these observations with them.
Slow down your thoughts and actions by slowing down your breathing. Intentionally lengthen your breath and breathe from your diaphragm, or even from your belly.;
, Instead of taking the floor to talk, focus on listening. You can learn and observe a lot by slowing down and letting your loved one speak. Notice not only the words they say but how they say them. Set aside your own agenda and stay away from distractions. Check in on your understanding by asking questions and getting clarification. People like to know that they are heard and understood, and this is a great way to show love.For example, say, “I hear you saying that you’d like the dishes taken care of right away.” You can also say, “I can tell you’re feeling angry. What happened?”

, Observe what your loved shows you through their body language. Look at their face and read their expressions. When feeling comfortable, people tend to arch their eyebrows and relax their arms and facial muscles. When someone is in a hurry, they may point their hips or legs in the direction of the exit, or not make as much eye contact. Be aware on not only their words but their actions.If you notice someone’s body language, adjust your conversation based on what you see. For example, say, “I can tell you need to go. Let’s catch up later.” This can make someone feel like you’re really tuned into them.
Mirroring often happens in loving relationships. This means that both people tend to behave in similar ways, talk in the same tone, and coordinate body movements.

Be kind.,
Be honest.,
Be thoughtful.,
Be affectionate.,
Be chivalrous.,
Be supportive.,
Be there for her.",How to Show a Girl You Love Her2," Show your girl that you love her by always being kind to her, no matter where you are or who you're with. It doesn't matter if you're the nicest guy in the world when the two of you are alone, if you're a jerk to her in front of your friends. You need to inhabit the Mr. Nice Guy persona 100% of the time.


Being kind to your girl includes listening to her, always respecting her opinion (even if you disagree), complimenting her, never making her feel bad about herself and doing nice things for her, without needing to be asked.
The whole ""treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen"" philosophy is completely overrated, girls want to be with guys who treat them well, especially when it comes to committed relationships.

, Honesty is so important when it comes to love. If you are dishonest, your girl won't be able to trust you, which doesn't bode well for your relationship. You should always tell the truth, whether it's about why you never called her last night, or admitting it was you who broke her favorite mug. She might be angry at the time, but she'll appreciate your honesty in the long-run.


You should also be honest in terms of your feelings towards her. If you're falling in love with her, but haven't said anything about it, muster your courage and tell her. Honesty is always the best policy when it comes to emotions.
Tackle any problems or worries you face together, don't bottle things up. That way, she'll know that you trust her. The two of you will be closer and your relationship will be stronger for it.

, Small, thoughtful words and actions are a great way to show a girl you love her. Being thoughtful shows a girl that you listen to her and that you are considerate of her thoughts and feelings. Being thoughtful may be something that comes naturally to you, otherwise you may need to put in a little extra effort to show you care. You can do this by finding out more about her likes and dislikes and by suppressing any selfish tendencies so you can try to put her needs first.


Some examples of ways you can be more thoughtful include: finding out how she likes her coffee (sugar, cream, etc.) and bringing her a cup in the morning or at lunch; letting her choose what movie to go and see, even if it's something you're not particularly interested in; picking up on any comments she might have made about a book she wants to read or a CD she'd like to listen to and buying it for her. You should also make an effort to remember important dates or occasions, like her birthday or the anniversary of your first date, and mark it by giving her a cupcake or a cute card.
Being thoughtful also means being considerate of how your actions will affect her. Like if you're planning a night out with the guys and won't be able to contact her, you should let her know and tell her you'll call her in the morning. That way she won't be wondering where you are. Or if you have a lot of female friends, your should avoid flirting with them or being overly touchy-feely with them while she's around, as this might make her feel insecure.

, Being affectionate is an obvious and great way to show a girl you love her. Being affectionate includes holding her hand, giving her lots of hugs and kisses, and calling her by a pet name like ""honey"", ""sweetheart"" or something more personal to the two of you. You don't have to reserve this affectionate behavior for when the two of you are alone, you can be affectionate in public or with friends by standing or sitting near her and putting your arm around her shoulders or waist. Show the world that you're proud to be with this girl and she'll know you love her.


You should try to be the one to initiate contact sometimes. Grab her hand when you're walking down the street or surprise her with a bear hug from behind. Little things like this can really make a girl feel special.
Just be conscious of doing things that she might feel uncomfortable with. She may not appreciate you being all over her around her friends and family as this can make her feel awkward. Be considerate of her feelings and make sure you know where the boundaries are.

, Prove that chivalry is not dead by acting like a gentleman towards your girl (and any other women in your life). Try opening doors for her, letting her order first at a restaurant, offering her your jacket if she's cold and waiting to make sure she gets inside okay when you drop her home. In general, you should try to make her feel both safe and respected, without being in any way condescending. Let her know that you'll always have her back and that you'll stand up for her when she needs you.


Be aware that being a gentleman does not mean that you should do everything for her all the time or assume that she can't manage on her own, as she may find this disrespectful. Tell her that you love how independent she is, but that you like doing things for her from time to time.
Being chivalrous is less about treating her like a damsel in distress and more about giving her the respect she deserves.

, Try to be as encouraging and supportive as possible towards the girl you love. This means that you should encourage her goals and dreams, and not dismiss them or laugh them off as being silly or unrealistic. You should help her out whenever you can, or just be there for her when she needs you. She'll appreciate it more than you know.


You can be supportive of her in a multitude of ways, whether it's by going to see the play she has a supporting role in, by listening to her practice the presentation she has to give at work or school, or just by giving her a shoulder to cry on when she needs to vent.

, You can really show a girl you love her by being there for her whenever she needs you most. Whether she's had a fight with her best friend, didn't get the exam results she was hoping for, or is grieving for a lost loved one, your job is to be there for her and let her know that you love her no matter what. It's fine to be with her during the good times, but the true test of your love is whether you can stick it out during the bad times. Be there for her when she really needs you and she'll have no doubt about your feelings for her.


You can be there for someone in a number of ways. You can simply give them a shoulder to cry on, boost their confidence by reminding them what a great person they are, or just take their mind of things by doing something fun with them. Try to read the situation to figure out what she needs the most.
You can also show a girl you love her by letting her be there for you when you need it. Don't shut her out or leave her in the dark when you're going through a rough patch, let her in and share your feelings with her. She'll know that you trust her and depend on her and you'll both realize that you're stronger together.

, If you notice your loved one needing help with something, step in. especially if they need something a bit complicated (like help with taxes or putting together furniture), your willingness to help will show that you’re willing to put in some effort to support them.If they have many grocery bags and seem flustered, stop what you’re doing and help bring them inside the house. Don’t ask if they need help, step in and start helping.

, If you see your loved one doing something nice, show that you noticed by leaving a note. Notice the small things and let them know that you appreciate them. Put the notes somewhere they can see, such as on the table in the morning. Or, you can hide them places so that they can find them as a surprise, such as in their lunchbox or backpack, underneath their pillow, or in their shoe.


For example, leave a note that says, “I was tired last night and you were very sweet to make dinner and clean up. I really appreciated it!”
For a child, say, “I saw you being nice to your sister and sharing. Good job!”

Be supportive.,
Give gifts based on their likes.,
Invest in their interests.",How to Show Love Through Observation3," Show up to your loved one’s major events. This might mean attending your kid’s sports games or recitals, going to your partner’s work functions, or being there for your family through a tragedy. You don’t need to say anything to show your support. Just showing up and being there is often enough to make someone feel loved and supported.


For example, attend your children’s plays and let them know how proud you are. Celebrate special moments with your family by going out to dinner or having a special meal at home.

, When it’s time to give them a gift, observe their likes and preferences, then act on them. Your loved one may mention they appreciate hand-made gifts or items from a certain store. Observe these preferences and perhaps even write them down so that you’re ready to give a heartfelt and meaningful gift when the time comes.


For example, if they mention they like blue flowers, surprise them with a bouquet of blue flowers one day.

, If your loved one loves a sports team or music artist, take note. Perhaps they make a passing comment about wanting to try a new restaurant in town or go ice skating. Observe these interests, then create an experience around them. Plan an activity doing something they mentioned in the past. Paying attention to these details can make them feel loved and care for.For example, buy the person tickets to a sports game or play you know they’ll love.
If they like adventurous experiences, take them rock climbing or paragliding.
These experiences may have deeper meaning because you initiated them.

Stick to setting up people you already know well.,
Match up friends who have something in common.,
Tell your friends your intentions.,
Consider the consequences if the match doesn’t work out.",How to Set Up Two of Your Best Friends Romantically1," If you try matching up a good friend with an acquaintance who you really don’t know much about, there is a risk that things can go wrong beyond the two not having any chemistry. That acquaintance might turn out to be an unpleasant person or even dangerous. Be sure you really know the two people involved before attempting to coordinate a romantic connection.;
, Variety is said to be the spice life, but your two friends will need to have something to talk about during the date you are trying to set up. When they have shared interests, it will be easier for them to connect with one another. Plus, shared interests tend to lead to more meaningful connections.At the very least, you want them to enjoy their time together even if they don’t make a romantic connection.


One method for opening up one friend to the idea of being introduced to another friend is to say something like, “Have I ever mentioned my friend Rick before? I was just realizing that the two of you have both been to Spain.”
Avoid setting up friends who could potentially clash over major lifestyle differences. For instance, if you know your guy friend can’t wait to find someone to marry and have children with but your female friend doesn’t plan to have children and prefers to take it slow in her relationships, that might not be a wise match.

, Let your friends know that you’d like to introduce them to someone because you think they’d hit it off. It’s best not to be sneaky when trying to bring two people together. Both parties should be open to meeting. Otherwise, things could get awkward if you thrust them together unexpectedly, which might squash any chance of them developing a romantic relationship.When speaking with each friend, be sure to highlight the positives about the other person.
Try saying something along the lines of, “I have this friend Jill who is really great at cooking. She’s funny too. I think you’d like her. Maybe I can introduce you some time, if that’s alright with you.”

, Before setting up two of your friends, first think about what might happen if things don’t go smoothly. Suppose they do go on a date but have a miserable time and never want to see each other again. That might mean that you cannot invite the both to the same social gatherings, such as cookouts at your place. Keep this in mind when considering setting up two people who have the potential to run into one another again after the date.If the two friends are coworkers, even if they work in different departments or separate buildings, it might be best not to play matchmaker. If things end badly between them, there is still the potential that they could run into one another in the workplace.
Another thing to keep in mind is how your friendship with both parties might be affected. If things don’t work out between them, you could find yourself caught in the middle should they choose to gossip about one another to you. You might even be asked to choose sides.
If things do not work out, offer each friend a simple apology. You can say something like, “I’m sorry things didn’t work out.” Then, avoid bringing up the topic again. Only discuss the situation if the other person brings it up first.

Be subtle when introducing the two friends.,
Arrange a casual meeting.,
Avoid forcing a love match.",How to Set Up Two of Your Best Friends Romantically2," When the two friends you are setting up meet for the first time, make them feel comfortable. Talking about how they’d make a great couple when they’ve only just met could make them both uncomfortable. Additionally, making a quick introduction and then walking away might leave them both feeling awkward with nothing to say to one another. Likewise, avoid putting them in a situation in which they are the only two single people at a gathering. When first introducing them, let them get to know each other a bit before pushing them together as a couple.


When one friend approaches while you’re talking to the other friend, introduce them by name. Then try saying something like, “You know, Mia enjoys gardening and has a green thumb just like you Joe.” Now your two newly introduced friends can strike up a conversation about their shared interest in gardening.

, A great way to get your two friends to spend some time around each other is to invite them to a casual gathering. With you there, you can help focus the conversation on a topic you know is of interest to both of them. Plus, you can keep the conversation going in moments of awkward silence so that neither of them feels overly uncomfortable.


Invite your two friends out for appetizers or drinks.
Organize a weekend cookout or host a small party at your place and invite both friends.
Plan a mutually liked activity, such as hiking or mini golf, and invite both of your friends to join you.
If you are in a relationship, suggest a double date with you and your partner accompanied by the two friends you wish to set up.

They might not hit it off immediately, but perhaps they will down the road. Pushing things too much in the beginning could sabotage any possibility of them making a connection in the future.Likewise, pushing your two friends into a dating situation they just aren’t interested in might damage their friendship with you.

Keep follow up to a minimum.,
Refrain from interfering.,
Set aside your personal feelings.",How to Set Up Two of Your Best Friends Romantically3," Once your two friends actually go out on a date alone, you’ll probably be curious to know how things went. Your friends will likely anticipate you following up with a few questions. However, just because you introduced them doesn’t mean they have to share every detail of their date with you. Avoid pressuring your friends to tell you everything.


Do not interrupt your two friends while they’re out on a date alone. Avoid texting to find out how things are going until you are sure the date is over. Waiting until the next day to follow up is best.
When you do follow up, try asking something simple like, “How did things go?”

, After your friends have gone out once or twice, it might be tempting to continue helping the match along. It is best to avoid interfering, though. Once you’ve introduced them and they’ve made the decision to get to know each other better, your work is done. Unless one of them has specifically asked you to remain involved by mentioning something specific to their date or by organizing another outing, you should stay out of it. Your friends don’t need your help coordinating every step of their potential relationship. Plus, they might get annoyed by your constant interference, which could cause problems in your friendships with both parties., It can be exciting when you match two friends together who end up making a love connection.

Open up about personal matters.,
Acknowledge the differences in male psychology.",How to Win a Guy's Heart," Self-confidence doesn't mean having a big ego or thinking you can do anything. It means knowing that you are worth the things in life you want to have. Thinking positively about yourself makes a world of difference in the way you personally fell and the way you perceive your surroundings.If you want to win over someone's heart, you need to first feel like you're truly worth being loved.


Of course, having self-confidence is easier said than done for most people. You may find it helpful to make a list of things you like about yourself. Try to think of ten things, no matter how big or small they may be. Making a list is no time to be immodest, so go for broke and see what turns up. If you ever feel down on yourself, remember the list an all you have to offer.;
, There are so many reasons you should put emphasis on health. While it has the most obvious effect of helping you look your best, taking proper care of yourself will maximize your self-confidence and boost your mood. Of course, all of this is recommended if you want to show a guy everything you can be.Get enough sleep.Sleeping at a regular time each night will give you energy throughout the day.
Hygiene is practically mandatory for self-confidence's sake.Not to mention guys are not usually into someone who doesn't tend to simply things like teeth-brushing or nail trimming.
Exercise is an essential part of feeling your best.Eat a healthy, balanced diet.This includes introducing healthy things like vegetables into your meals as much as cutting out things like fast food and candy.

, It should be noted that there is no single style that is going to work for everyone. Adding to that, guys' tastes are all over the map, so you shouldn't be dressing to cater to anyone but yourself. Rather, maximizing the benefits of fashion has a lot to do with dressing to suit yourself as an individual. If you're drawing a blank, look to the style of a celebrity you admire. Use her fashion sense as a starting point and go from there.Although a personal sense of style should be most important in choosing your wardrobe, there are certain looks that geometrically fit certain body types better than others. Look into what generally suits your body type, or ask a salesperson at a clothing store for tips., It is natural for people to be attracted to people that reflect something of themselves. If you think you have a type, whether it's outgoing, funny or confident guys, you can maximize your chances of hitting it off with one of them if you demonstrate some of those personality traits yourself.Bear in mind that this does not mean changing any part of yourself to match a guy's type. Instead, it's most likely these positive traits are already a part of you. Emphasizing them will make it more likely to grab the interest of a guy who shares those traits as well.

, This bit of advice is so often used that it may have made you roll your eyes when you read it. Even so, if you want to win a guy over, learning to be truly comfortable and attuned with yourself is the best service you can do yourself. Learn to follow your instincts more, and learn to be conscious of your thoughts.

, In the scenario that you haven't met a suitable guy yet, you should maximize your chances of meeting someone special. If you're open to the idea of being approached at an event, keeping yourself in a smaller group will make it easier for guys to approach you.If you're part of a large group, guys are far more likely to feel intimidated.


The most common way of meeting someone is through mutual friends, so you shouldn't feel the need to depend on meeting strangers for your next relationship.
While places like bars and clubs are the go-to destination for meeting singles, they're bound to attract certain types of guys moreso than others. Moreover, there are a great many more places you can meet people.

, A mutual acquaintance is the most common way of meeting someone.If you want to met a guy, look to your existing circle of friends as a resource. Most introductions will happen naturally. Of course, if you already have your eye on one guy in particular, you can ask a friend to introduce the two of you.


When you're introducing yourself, keep the context of the situation in mind. Introduce yourself in terms that relate to the situation you're sharing with the guy.For example, if you're at a party, you might say: ""It's nice to meet you. I was invited here by . Who do you know here?""
Even if you don't have a means of being introduced through mutual friends, you shouldn't hesitate to approach someone on your own if you're interested enough. Introducing yourself without help can be pretty anxiety-inducing, but guys will often react better to it much better than you think they will.

, There has been an incredible amount of research put into the act of smiling.Suffice to say, whether or not you think you have a brilliant smile, there are few better ways to attract positive attention. When a girl smiles at a guy, it can also be construed as flirtatious.


Smiling doesn't come naturally to everyone. If this is the case, practicing in your own time can go a long way.Smiling is also a great way to signal someone to approach you if that's what you want., Ask questions, and allow him to open up to you. Depending on how assertive the guy is naturally, this may come through naturally. If it doesn't at first, it may be a case that the guy needs time to warm up to you.


You can ask open ended questions if you want the guy to take the lead in a conversation. An open-ended question is something where the guy could take the answer in a number of directions.The most common open-ended question is ""Tell me a little about yourself.""
Once you break the ice, you should ask him questions that sincerely interest you. For example if you've overheard him talking about what he does for work, you might ask something like ""Why did you get into your current line of work?""

, When you meet a guy, there is a charged momentum, and catching the wave can mean everything when it comes to stealing his heart away.


Keep in mind there is a difference between openly admitting ""I love you"" and simply making your attraction apparent. Flirting can say every bit as much, especially if it's mutual and the right chemistry is there.

, The question, then, is to figure out whether he feels the same way already. Common signs can include whether he's introducing you to his friends or opening up about more personal topics.


If he's not doing this yet at this point, it doesn't mean he's not interested, nor does it even mean you don't have his heart already. Certain guys express affection differently than others.

, If mutual attraction is already there, openly discussing personal things, whether they are painful experiences or insecurities, makes the connection feel more important and real. Being personal and candid about your feelings shows a longer-lasting commitment between the two of you, but it's only truly meaningful if the exchange goes both ways. If the guy you're interested in doesn't have an easy time talking about his feelings, it's best not to press it. You should let him know you are there for him whenever he feels the need to talk about things like that.


State your intentions about wanting to grow closer if your partner is confused as to why you're approaching him with touchy subjects.It is more important for you to understand rather than be understood. Especially at first, guys tend to be more closeted about their feelings. In time, he'll find it easier to open up to you., When you're making an earnest attempt at winning over a guy's heart, it pays off to understand that men interpret and demonstrate feelings in a much different way than women. If you're getting frustrated the guy isn't showing enough feeling, it may be because he's been more conditioned to hide the way he feels than you have. Whatever the case may be, it is important to be patient in navigating the differences between male and female psychologies. Chances are high he is feeling just as confused about the way you act."

You could join your school's art club, for example. If the goth girl you like is in a particular club, this could also be a way to get to know her.
Explore creative activities that interest you. If you love music, for example, try learning the guitar and writing some songs. If you enjoy poetry, try writing some of your own poems.

, It can be hard to talk to someone you like. You want to find a natural way to begin a conversation. This can be done in several ways.You can make an observation. This invites her to share her opinion with you. For example, say the two of you have class together. You could sit next to her and say something like, ""Wow, that quiz yesterday was really tough.""
You could also ask a question. This can help show her you find her interesting. For example, say she's wearing a shirt with a slogan on it. Say something like, ""That's a really cool phrase. Is it from something?""

, Regular conversation will allow you to get to know her. This can get her to like you, and allow you to eventually work up the courage to ask her out.Be a good listener. The goth girl will be more interested in you if you're invested in getting to know her as a person. Listen to what she has to say and ask follow up questions. For example, ""You grew up in Vermont? That's so interesting. Can you tell me more?""
Pay her compliments. Say things like, ""You look really nice today"" and ""I love your new haircut.""

, Individuality is a staple in goth culture. A goth girl is unlikely to share your affections if you don't let her be herself. Make it clear you respect how she chooses to dress and act.Never make negative comments on her appearance. Don't say things like, ""I wish you would wear more color."" Allow her to be herself.
Tell you that you admire her for being so unique. This will help her see you like her for who she is. A goth girl will not want to be with someone who expects her to change.

, You want to be an individual as well. A goth girl will value someone who's unafraid to be his or herself. When you interact with her, always be genuine.Do not feign interest in her. When you ask her questions and make conversations, talk about things you are genuinely interested in. The sincerity will be easy to recognize.
Do not simply agree with everything she says. A goth girl will respect the fact you have your own tastes and interests as long as you respect her tastes and interests. For example, ""Honestly, I didn't really like that book, but I totally get why you did. It's okay if we disagree.""

, It's best to be direct when asking someone out. You do not want to leave room for any confusion or ambiguity. If you're nervous, take a few deep breaths before asking the girl out. You can also practice what you want to say in the mirror ahead of time.Be direct. Start the conversation saying something like, ""Can I ask you something?""
From there, ask her out in a way that makes it clear it's a date. For example, ""Could I take you out on a date this Friday?""

, It's important to be genuine. Remember, goths value individuality. A goth girl is unlikely to be swept off her feet by over-the-top romantic gestures, as they may read as corny or empty. Focus on being yourself. Express your opinions and let conversation unfold naturally.Remember, however, do not dominate the conversation. While you should let the goth girl get a glimpse of who you are as a person, she may be put off if you talk about yourself too much. Ask her questions about herself and try to get to know her more.

, If you begin dating, you should work on planning dates a goth girl would enjoy. Think about her interests and goth culture when planning activities.Take her places like art shows, museums, and plays. Goth girls may like cultural activities.
If she's into the darker side of goth culture, try catering to that. Go see a dark movie together or take a walk through a cemetery.

, You cannot force someone to like you. Despite your best efforts, the goth girl may simply not feel the same way about you. If this is the case, accept her decision and move on.You can't control the factors that make a person want to date you. The goth girl may simply not be attracted to you, or just see you as a friend.
Give yourself a week to mourn the loss. It's okay to be sad and disappointed. Remember, however, there are many other girls out there. Next time, you could find someone more compatible with you.

Don't respond right away.",How to Write a Love Email," What does your partner bring to your life? What was missing from your life before you met your partner? What sticks in your mind when your partner is absent? One of the nicest things that you can do in any sort of correspondence is to write from the heart and include specific and detailed answers to these questions.


If you're having trouble getting started, this can be a great way to get something out of the way and explain why you're writing, and what you want to say: ""I've needed to say this for far too long and I couldn't wait any longer to let you know exactly how I feel about you."";
, Love e-mails are a great chance to reminisce about a good date you recently had together, or another shared experience. Whether you're writing to a lover who's far away, or someone who's in the same town, it's a great way to express your feelings, especially feelings you may have kept hidden during the moment.An e-mail can be a great opportunity to explain how you're feeling after a first date, or after a couple dates, if you're the shy type. Talk about what you enjoyed about the date, and what you admire in the person.
It doesn't have to be serious and it's best to keep it focused on something light. Instead of recounting how your heart fluttered so when you kissed your lover on the boardwalk at midnight, reminisce about how it rained on both of you just after, or how your dinner was a disaster, or how ridiculous your cab driver was.

, Whether you're writing to someone you're with already, or you're writing to someone you hope to get with, your goal is to move things forward and present yourself as an interesting, engaging person worth spending a bit more time with. How to do this? Give the person something to look forward to.


Intro the letter with general details, a description of your day, or a funny story about your cat, then move into an idea about a thing you could do together in the future. Shoot someone a link to a play you want to check out, or the Yelp page of a restaurant that looks good. It's an e-mail. Use the Internet to your advantage.
E-mails aren't always the best venue for deep thoughts and serious expressions of feelings. Save that for real conversations, and keep your lovey e-mails as practical as possible, sprinkled with real heart and charm.

, If your partner has asked you a bunch of questions in your last correspondence, don't ignore those questions and launch into a long tone poem about how much you miss them. Address the questions you were asked, which will give you a good way to get started.

, In longer or established relationships, you may want your love e-mail to get a little more serious, because you're writing for a special occasion or want to express something deeper. Choose a particular trait in your partner that you want to praise.Consider the following questions for good options:


What is your partner's greatest strength?
What do you see in them that they may not see?
What is your best memory together?
How has your relationship changed you for the better?
What made you fall in love?

, There isn't anything worse than a love letter that's depressing or desperate. Even if you're far away from your partner, and you miss them terribly, nobody wants to read about how you're trumping around the house, and can't eat or go out because of your unending devotion. Pull it together and give your partner reasons to want to see you, not reasons to stay away.


Your partner wants to know that their lover is living a real life and accomplishing goals and standing strong for them. How can they know you're reliable if you are always down about their absence?

, Showing a genuine interest in your partner's life and trying to learn more about them is one of the best ways to come up with content for your loving e-mail. Show curiosity. Write as if you can't wait to get a response. As long as your questions are sincere, light, and avoid awkward probing or jealous suspicion, asking questions is a great way and reason to write an e-mail.


Good questions: What have you been up to? How was your weekend at the lake? I've been thinking lots about you since that night at the lake. Have you?
Bad questions: Where were you last night? Who were hanging out with? Why didn't you call me? Are you going to call me? I love you, do you love me?

, In long distance relationships, you'll often find that e-mailing is one of the more convenient and regular ways of corresponding, especially if you're both busy and don't have the time or energy to Skype or phone chat for 2 hours a night. Eventually, you may feel like you're running out of steam, but just taking some time to write, even if it seems mundane, will let your partner know that you care.


Tell a goofy story about your pet, or something that happened at work. Write about yourself, and ask questions to your partner. The mundane can still be romantic if it comes from a place of sincerity. Share your life with someone.
Easiest, best, and most effective thing to put into a love e-mail: ""I can't stop thinking about you.""

, The purpose of a love letter is to elicit feelings of love from the person who is reading it. To woo. Telling someone you love them over and over and over won't do that. Charming them to pieces by making your life sound interesting, lovable, and unforgettable? That's more like it.

, Say you need to write your partner an e-mail, but all you've done today was goon-out on the TV and eat ramen. That may seem like the makings of a pretty boring love e-mail, but good writers can inject anything with a little life, a little charm, and enough vivid details to make it seem downright charming:


""Today my roommate has been conducting experiments in the kitchen, taking prefabricated blocks of noodle stuffs and boiling them in a mixture of salt and tap water. The results are staggering, possibly bioterroristic, and he claims delicious. My senses tell me that you're entirely too classy to come to my house and experience this ramen disaster, so I propose a date to the movies, to solve both our problems.""

, Before you hit ""send,"" it's a good idea to count up the number of ""I love yous"" in the email. If you're running into double-digits, cut most of them. You don't want your ""I love you"" to turn into a cheapened meaningless phrase, and e-mails are unfortunately an easy way to make that happen.


Good rule of thumb: If you accidentally sent this e-email to your best friend instead of your lover, how embarrassing would it be? If the answer is ""extremely,"" make it a little less cheesy.

, Words can be sexy, but it's usually best to let your wit and your charm do the wooing, not your graphic descriptions of anatomy. In general, you don't want love letters or e-mails to turn into more pornographic territory. Save it for the meet-up.


If the emailing takes a turn into more adult territory, it shouldn't be right away, and it shouldn't be one-sided. Let it build slowly, and let your partner make the first move, then follow suit.
If you want to exchange racier e-mails, try starting extremely slowly, using innuendo and seeing if your partner picks up on the sexual tension. If not, drop it. Don't start writing about how you couldn't get the firm, supple cantaloupes at the store out of your mind all day, or you'll come off like a weirdo.

, If you want to woo with your words, make sure you didn't include any unfortunate typos. Let your e-mail sit for a while, then return to it an hour later and read over it closely with fresh eyes. Work through it and make it sound good. You want to get your words down right.

, Just because you're writing e-mail doesn't mean it shouldn't look like a regular love letter. Include a basic salutation, addressing the letter to your lover with a ""Dear,"" and close the letter ""Love"" or ""Yours"" and your name.Other good closings might include, ""Lovingly"" or ""Always,"" but it's usually the simplest that gets the job done right. Good time to use the ""L"" word.
Stilted closings should be avoided. No ""Sincerely"" or ""All best."" You're not writing to your boss.
If you use a pet name with your partner, that's totally cool. You can and should use it. If you don't use one, though, don't try to make it happen in e-mail. Awkward.

, A love message that looks like textspeak will be hard to take seriously. Not all relationships are the same, but if it's important for you to write your loving feelings to someone, it can't hurt to do it in semi-formal language, using proper capitalization, spelling, and basic grammar rules.


Of course, there's no e-mail gestapo, and there's no one way to write to your lover. If you both favor the well-placed emoji to the well-drawn metaphor, go for it. Write ""luv u bae."" Still, try to make your e-mails easy to read, and spell out words whenever possible.
Pay especially close attention to ""your"" and ""you're."" Mixing those up is a turn-off for some people.

, Getting an email titled ""Hey"" or ""I Love You"" is like getting a gift without any packaging. It might seem like a little thing, and it's true that the content is more important, but learning to properly title your e-mails, especially your charming, witty, lovey-dovey ones, will make them that much better.


Good tactic: If you can't think of anything good, scan through the email and look for a funny bit of language that you can use to slap in the title window. It'll seem charming, and funny when your partner gets to that patch of the letter.

, One well-written, engaging, heartfelt, witty, charming e-mail to a lover is a wonderful thing to receive. It can be a gift. But 15 increasingly desperate two-sentence e-mails with nothing but emojis and the sentence ""Where r u??!"" won't be. try to restrain yourself, even if you're feeling the big feelings. It's always better to compose one good email and put the ball into the other court, then leave them wanting more.


What's longish? It depends, but a good rule of thumb is to copy-paste your text into a word document and do a word count. If it's longer than the last history paper you wrote, and you're getting a short paragraph in reply, maybe start cutting them down a bit.

, You don't want to give the impression that you're sitting and staring at your gmail window waiting for a response. Even if it's a coincidence that you saw the e-mail pop into your inbox, play it cool. Wait at least a couple hours to respond and try to think of good responses and good content in the meantime. It's better to be good than fast anyway.


After you write a draft, it's a good idea to let it sit for a while to, go do something else, and go back to it to read it with fresh eyes. Still feel the same way about those powerful emotions you dumped into the e-mail? See any typos? Always a good idea to let it sit before you dash it off.

Choose a meaningful song.,
Decide if you will sing acapella or with instrumental accompaniment.,
Practice.",How to Serenade a Woman1," The song you select should reflect this grandness and represent your feelings for the woman. Pick a song that is meaningful to the two of you as a couple. Alternatively, you can woo her with a song that is special to her.If you’re struggling to pick a song, opt for a classic love ballad. Popular options include Frankie Valli’s “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You” and Paul McCartney’s “Maybe I’m Amazed.”
Pick a song in your vocal range.;
, In addition to selecting a song, you need to decide how you will perform it. This decision is largely based on your comfort and skill level. There are several options to consider:

Choose an appropriate location.,
Singing to your lady.",How to Serenade a Woman2," When you decided to serenade the special lady in your life, chances are you had an occasion in mind. If not, that’s okay—spontaneous serenading is always appreciated. Perhaps you want to serenade this woman on her birthday, Valentine’s Day, or your anniversary. Alternatively, you could serenade her as part of a marriage proposal or even a dance proposal.

, When selecting a location, you should always take the woman’s personality into consideration. Is she an incredibly private person or does she love being in the spotlight? If the woman is shy and/or private, she will not appreciate being serenaded in a public setting. Instead, opt for an intimate and secluded setting. If the woman revels in attention, pick a public place, like a restaurant or a local park. You could even organize a flash mob!, Once the moment arrives, go for it! You’ve prepared and planned for this day. Sing with confidence and a smile on your face. If you make a mistake, brush it off and keep going."
"
Hire a musician or group to serenade her.,
Play an instrument.,
Make a romantic playlist.",How to Serenade a Woman3," If singing isn’t for you, consider hiring a musician or group to perform for her. Instead of stressing out, you can snuggle up with the woman and enjoy the concert. If you feel moved, you could even ask her dance.

, Are you a talented instrumentalist? Instead of singing, woo her with your skill on the violin, saxophone, or piano. In addition to impressing her, you’ll also highlight one of your many unique skills.

, If you are not at all musically inclined (or maybe just a little shy), it is still possible to express your feelings through music. Create a playlist with romantic and meaningful tunes. During your next date, turn on the playlist. At the end of the night, send her home with a copy of the special mix."

Proceed respectfully.",How to Romantically Hug a Woman," Create a comfortable level of privacy so that the two of you can be fully present in your intimacy. Be reasonably certain that no one is going to barge in on you, and that you won't disturb anyone else with your romantic hug. You don't want to rush this.;
, It will be much easier to make the hug romantic if you are both already standing upright. Hug her when you are greeting or saying goodbye – during any transitional scene when you both happen to be standing. If you're going for a longer, deeper hug, then make sure that you have at least a few minutes.


If you aren't standing, wait for a better time, or simply ask her for a hug.
If one of you cannot stand for some reason, then you should at least be sitting next to one another without any barriers between. Sit on the ground, or on a bench, or on a bed.

, This perhaps goes without saying, but do not try to romantically hug a woman who is not romantically interested in you. The romantic hug is an intimate move, and it may not be well-received before she is ready.

, Look into her eyes. Place one arm under her armpit, in the lower half of her ribcage. Put your other hand on the general area of her shoulder blade. As the hug deepens, you can hold her waist or wrap both arms around the small of her back.Alternately, hug her from behind. Wrap your arms around her torso or waist, and hold her tight. Let her head rest comfortably against your chest.

, Make it steamy. Gaze deeply and longingly into her eyes, and use the warmth of the hug to show her how you feel about her. Squeeze her tightly enough to show her that you care, but not so tightly that you hurt her at all.Be confident. Don't hesitate to show her how you feel. It will be better for both of you if you go into the hug feeling comfortable with one another.
Try not to be self-conscious. Focus only on the moment, and on her.

, Pull her towards you and squeeze. Not too hard, or you'll hurt her. Slowly rub your hands up and down her back and rub your bodies together. Don't be afraid to explore with your hands, but make sure that she's into it.


If you know each other well enough, then you may be brave enough to go towards her butt. Squeeze a cheek gently but firmly, and then let go – just enough to tease her.

, Don't hold on for so long that you make her uncomfortable. If you feel her start to release her grip on you: lighten up the hug.

, Tell her how she makes you feel, or how much you want her. Tell her that you love her, or that she's beautiful. Use a low, sexy voice, and make sure that she hears every word., If you know her really well, then gently put a leg around her and pull her close. Slowly guide her to a comfortable surface. Sit her down on your lap while slowly turning her head towards yours. Kiss her passionately while still rubbing her back with your arms, and give her a little massage. Intensify the kiss as you slowly put her underneath you.


A romantic hug can lead to much more if the two of you are comfortable being intimate with one another. Just make sure that you're both ready.Always ask for consent. Before each move that you make to escalate the situation, ask her casually for permission. Say, for instance, ""Do you mind if I take off your dress?"" Try stating what you want, and giving her opportunity to say what she wants: ""I want to make out on the bed. Is that something you want to do?"", If she seems into it, then don't be afraid to keep going. If you pick up some hesitance from her, then slow down and let the hug just be a hug. Remember: it won't be romantic unless you're both into it!

Watch for eye contact.,
See if she initiates touch.,
Note if she mirrors your gestures.,
Listen to her voice and tone.,
Look for an open posture.",How to Recognize Hints That a Girl Likes You1," If a girl likes you, she's likely to give you a lot of her attention. One way to tell if she's paying attention to you during conversation is eye contact. A girl who likes you will attempt to make eye contact throughout the conversation.If you feel the girl hold your eye contact longer than most people do, she may like you.
You may also notice the girl holds your gaze for a moment and then glances downward towards your chest before gazing up again. This is a more intimate means of eye contact that could indicate attraction.
Also, try to see if she looks at you when you're not interacting with her. For example, maybe you see her glancing at you occasionally while you're on your lunch break or between classes.;
, If someone finds you attractive, they will want to touch you. You may find the girl makes excuses to get physically close to you.For example, the girl may sit closer to you when you talk so your legs brush. She may hug you when greeting you and after saying goodbye.
She may also make excuses to touch you. For example, she may say she wants to brush a dust bunny out of your hair.
You may also notice her leaning in during conversation.

, People tend to mimic the body language and gestures of people they're attracted to. Watch the girl when you interact and see if she imitates your body language.Compare your own posture to hers. If you're leaning back and crossing your legs, she may be doing something similar if she likes you.
Watch to see if she's mimicking any of your mannerisms. If you tend to gesticulate more when you talk, you may notice her doing the same.

, If a woman likes you, she will generally sound happy and excited when she sees and talk to you. You may also notice changes in her voice. Women often talk in a higher pitched tone if they're interested in someone. Listen to see if her voice seems slightly higher when she's talking to you., An open posture may indicate attraction. People often use an open posture to look welcoming to those they're attracted to.An open posture is marked by arms that are spread out somewhat and not crossed, legs parallel or stretched out slightly, and relaxed eye contact. This means the girl will generally hold your gaze, but her eyes may wander on occasion.If her whole body is angled towards you slightly, this also indicates attraction.However, some people get nervous talking to someone they like, which could prevent them feeling comfortable with an open posture. If the girl crosses her arms or leans back, watch for other signs, like the tone of her voice. No one sign will indicate for sure if someone likes you.

"
"
Pay attention to whether she compliments you.,
Consider the questions she asks you.,
See if she's attentive to you.,
Listen for laughter.",How to Recognize Hints That a Girl Likes You2," If a girl likes you, she's likely to lavish you with a little praise. You tend to put people you like on a pedestal. You see someone's positive qualities more intensely if you like them. If the girl likes you, she may compliment you more frequently if she's interested in you romantically.She may comment on things like your clothing, your tastes, and your personality.
Compliments may be worked into conversation. If you, say, mention you have hockey practice that night, she may pay you a compliment about your athletic ability.

, If a girl is interested in you, she will want to get to know you better. During conversation, listen to the questions she asks you to gauge her interest.If a girl likes you, she will ask more deep questions instead of sticking to conventional scripts.
For example, instead of saying, ""Do you have any siblings?"" she may say something like, ""Are you close to your family?""

, If someone likes you, they will pay attention to your needs. A girl may offer you her coat or scarf if it's cold outside, for example. She may also frequently ask you how you're doing or feeling.She will also be very attentive in conversation. A girl who likes you is unlikely to have her phone out while the two of you are talking. She will pay close attention to everything you do and say.

, If a girl likes you, all your good qualities will be magnified to her. Therefore, she's more likely to laugh at your jokes. Even if you're not sure if a joke is particularly funny, a girl who likes you will laugh loudly at it. If she laughs a lot in conversation, she may like you."
"
Note social media interactions.,
Look for frequent text messages.,
Pay attention to communication at night.,
Watch for emojis.",How to Recognize Hints That a Girl Likes You3," How often does the girl interact with you on sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram? If she likes you, she's likely to be very attentive to you through these outlets.Does she comment a lot on your posts? Does she like a lot of Facebook or Instagram posts or favorite and re-tweet a lot of your tweets?
Look at the context of the comments. Does it seem like she's trying to impress you a little? Are her comments more detailed than most? Does she try to make you laugh? If so, she may like you.

, If a girl likes you, she will probably text you more than most people. You may get texts throughout the day asking how you're doing and updating you on her day-to-day life.A lot of pictures may indicate a girl likes you. She may text you pictures of herself and of what she's doing.
How quickly does she reply to you? A girl who likes you a lot will reply quickly.

, Someone who texts you at night, especially just before bed, is probably thinking about you a lot. For example, she may text you something like, ""Good night"" each night before she goes to sleep., If a girl uses a lot of emojis, pay attention to them. Flirtatious emojis, like winking faces, hearts, and smiley faces, may indicate attraction.However, pay attention to context. Not all emojis are flirtatious, so take note of the message attached when reviewing emojis.

Think about why you want to wait.,
Determine your boundaries in advance.,
Stay away from lurid media depictions of sex and fantasy.,
Let your close friends know your decision to be abstinent.,
State your boundaries clearly and quickly in romantic situations.,
Remain firm in your beliefs, even if it means leaving events or parties.,
Remember that abstinence is the only 100% effective way to prevent pregnancy and STDs.",How to Wait to Have Sex1," You need to take a little time to think about what you want in a relationship, and why you want to wait for sex. Are you planning on waiting until marriage? Do you want to take new relationships slowly, without the burden of sex? Most importantly, think about your personal reasons for wanting to wait. Knowing why you want to wait will make it easier to explain to your partner and stand firm with your beliefs. There are a lot of reasons to wait to have sex, including:


Religious beliefs.
Desire to find the right person.
Getting to know someone emotionally before sex.
Avoiding complications, like STDs or pregnancy.
Taking the relationship slowly.;
, What sort of behavior do you classify as sex? Are you okay with kissing and touching? Are you waiting for all forms of sex, such as oral sex? You need to think about your lines now, not in the heat of the moment, so that it is easier to stand your ground when temptation comes.

If you were to have a physical relationship, what kind of things would be okay with you? What would you find acceptable, and what would you rather avoid?, Hollywood and pop culture put a lot of emphasis on sex, and it would be almost impossible to escape it all. But that doesn't mean that you need to seek it out. If something makes your uncomfortable, feel free to leave. You'll never change how other people view sex, but you can respect your own boundaries and keep sex at the periphery

Most of the depictions are fake, fictional accounts of sex. The promise of ""life-changing sex"" is not reality, and you should remember this if you feel pressured to become sexually active., Even if your friends are sexually active, letting them know your decision and reasoning will help them help you. This may include asking them not to discuss sex as much, helping you out at parties or difficult situations, and being a support system if you have questions or feel temptation. Having a good group of friends around you makes every situation easier, and this is no exception.

, This doesn't have to be the first thing you say, and it doesn't need to be a big conversation. But letting someone know that you aren't interested in sex is the best way to get people to stop pressuring you. If someone is flirting a little too heavily or making suggestions you don't agree with, look them in the eyes and let them know that you're not interested in sex.


""I've really enjoyed talking to you, but I'd like to slow things down a bit and get to know you more.""
""Thanks for the offer. I'll be going home alone tonight, though.""
""I'm not interested in hooking up tonight, thank you.""

, Never let peer pressure, media influences, or guilt-tripping force you to compromise your convictions. If someone is not respecting your decision to wait for sex, it is time to leave and go somewhere more supportive. A simple and firm, ""no thank you,"" or ""it's just not for me"" should be enough to get people off your back. If someone still pressures you, you should remove yourself from the situation.

""I've decided to wait until marriage for sex, and I wanted to find out together how we can make that work.""
""I really enjoy spending time with you, and I've decided I want to wait on sex for a while as our relationship grows.""

, One of the biggest benefits of waiting is that you get to know each other without pressure to perform sexually. You must build your relationship on trust and communication, not physical lust, in order for it to succeed. So take the time to talk together daily. Find hobbies you both share and go do them, and take the time to eat dinner together whenever possible. This will help you get a better idea of your partner without being blinded by sex, ultimately helping you decide if sex is right with them in the future.

, Hand holding, kissing, romantic touching, and snuggling are all great ways to maintain a physical spark without sex. There are plenty of ways to enjoy each other's company that don't involve going all the way. Find things that feel good and enjoy them without feeling like you need to escalate things.

Small things, like holding hands and hugging, are much more meaningful when taken slowly., If your partner continually makes passes at you or questions your decision to wait, they may not be respecting your choices. You should never stay with someone who makes your feel sad, angry, or guilty for deciding to wait. This is often a passive-aggressive plays to get you to have sex. You and your partner need to work together to build your relationship without sex. If your partner isn't doing their share you should find someone who is willing to respect your desires.

Have dates in public.
Move to separate rooms or beds late in the night, and avoid sleepovers.
Find activities together instead of simply ""hanging out."" Keep your relationship active.

, New research is finding out that relationships that wait to have sex are often much stronger, and lead to longer and happier couples. There is no magic number of days to wait. However, make sure that you like and love the person before sex to avoid confusing situations or realizations the morning after.Some benefits of waiting include:


Time to know one another.
Great respect and emphasis on small acts (hand-holding, kissing, etc.)
Avoid confusing lust for love.

Know that there is no ""right"" time to become sexually active.,
Avoid making spur-of-the-moment decisions to stop waiting.,
Find a partner that you know and trust.,
Work up to sex slowly.,
Ask yourself if you are ready before committing.",How to Wait to Have Sex3," Everyone has different reasons for beginning their sex lives, and there is no time that is ""too late."" You need to do what feels right to you and know that you aren't missing out because you've decided to practice abstinence.


The ""three-date rule"" about waiting in a relationship is an archaic, overly-simplistic rule. You should feel comfortable with your partner before having sex no matter how many dates it takes., If you're considering becoming sexually active you need to sit down and think about how your priorities or beliefs have shifted since deciding to wait. You do not want to regret your decision because you made it impulsively. However, if you've thought about having sex for a few weeks and have considered the potential repercussions already, it might be time to pursue a sexual relationship.


Talk to your partner about your changing viewpoints instead of making them guess. Your decision to become sexually active should be made together.

, All relationships, sexual included, are based on trust and communication. Waiting to have sex is a great way to get to know someone without the pitfalls and awkwardness of a new sexual relationship. When you do decide to have sex, having a partner who you can trust to treat you well will make the moment much less stressful. Whether this is your first time or just a new stage in the relationship, your sex life will be much happier when built on trust.


The only key to trust is open communication. Not just about your sex life, but about your entire relationship.

, Take your time instead of rushing under the sheets. Know that, at any point during foreplay or intercourse, that you can stop and pull things back. Kiss, hold each other, and work up to sex instead of making it the end all be all of your relationship. This will help your approach sex comfortably. You can ease into it as you learn about yourself and your partner.

, Becoming sexually active is a big decision, and you should not make it lightly. Spend some time thinking about this alone, before the heat of the moment. Some good questions to ask yourself include:


How do you feel when you are with this person? Are they caring and kind?
Does this person respect you and your opinions?
Have you talked together about whether or not to have sex yet?
Do you have access to birth control methods?
Do you feel pressured to have sex just to please your partner, or do you really want to have sex."

Just say no!,
Show him how you feel!,
Drop hints to him that you aren't ready.,
Tell him a thing or two!,
Turn him off.,
Know when to leave.,
Use mother nature to your advantage!",How to Say No to Sexual Pressure," If you let him know how you feel by telling him that you're not ready, he should respect you and follow in your lead. This simple word may not seem like much, but believe it or not, it can have a very big impact.;
, Sometimes how you feel can be displayed with facial expressions. If he starts to do something you're uncomfortable with, look at him with a slight scowl that shows your disappointment. This will not only encourage him to respect your wishes but it also shows how your roles in the relationship are equal.

, Before you can even be put in this awkward situation, casually mention how you find it socially unacceptable to sleep with a man before marriage. Hopefully he will get the hint, and if he doesn't, keep trying. If he does get the hint he should respect your wishes.

, If he has started to go farther than you are comfortable with, tell him ""If you go any further, you will ruin this relationship."" Be frank and clear, and make sure that he understands you. If you look him in the eyes while you say it, there is a better chance he will listen.

, Sometimes it is hard for someone to ignore their sexual urges. Try ""turning him off"" by telling him your parents called and you need to call them back or they will think that something bad has happened. Do not let him persuade you into calling them later, just pick up the phone and do it without hesitation. If you don't want to call your parents but still need an excuse, just say you are on the phone with your parents and then call a friend who knows of this plan and will pretend to be your parents. Another way to ""turn him off"" is to eat food in a non-attractive way, also known as ""stuffing your face."" Turning a man off can also be done by laughing really obnoxiously so it confuses him, and distracts him from other activities. If this does not seem to work, try adding some snorts in your obnoxious laugh, as this does not seem sexy at all to him.

, If things don't seem to be getting better, simply leave or shut him out. If you're at his home, pick up your purse and just walk out of the door. If you're at your own home, demand that he leaves, or you will call the cops.

, If you really need help, tell him that it's your ""time of the month"". This will usually turn a man off, and he won't want to do anything. If for some strange reason it does not, tell him you need to change your tampon. You could say pad, but the word ""tampon"" freaks guys out more.

Figure out what she likes and converse about it.,
Give her honest compliments.,
Make her laugh.,
Prove you're glad to be with her.",How to Romance a Girl1," No girl wants to hear only about you and your interests. In fact, it's much easier to win her over if you spend the majority of the conversation chatting about what she's into.You don't need to discuss ""girly"" topics. The barrier between men and women has been reduced significantly in the last decade. It's your responsibility to figure out what she's into and always digging deeper.


If you're really stuck on conversation topics, you can always start with larger discussion points and narrow it down.You might start by asking her about her hobbies or job aspirations. Once you bridge that initial gap, she'll open up about those topics, giving you room to investigate deeper. If she says she's into sailing, you can follow up with a barrage of other questions about that particular interest. Figure out who taught her how to sail or where she enjoys sailing. This could open up conversations about her experiences growing up, her love for nature, and more.;
, Everyone loves to receive a compliment, especially one that's original and specific to the individual.There's definitely a wrong way to compliment a woman; anything that you've heard in the movies will come across as corny or superficial. But if you learn how to compliment her properly without being too excessive, you'll make it clear that you're interested. Remember the four major guidelines to giving compliments:


Be succinct. If you speak for too long, you might talk yourself into a hole or worse, embarrass her.
Don't exaggerate. There's no need to call her the most amazing woman on Earth. Your compliments will work if they seem real and genuine, not extreme.
Be as specific as possible. Telling a girl that she's ""beautiful"" or ""awesome"" will do very little for you. If you've observed her behavior and listened to her conversations, then you'll have a good basis for real compliments.
Don't be excessive. If you throw out a couple compliments over the course of one date or interaction, you'll be in good shape. Anything more than that might seem a little desperate, and each compliment will lose impact.

, Laughter is a healing medicine, and there's no better way to break any tension than a shared moment of levity. It's also a great way to prove that you're paying attention to her, as most moments of laughter come as a direct response to a conversation point.Humor is also extremely flirtatious, so you'll be tapping into that if you're trying to make her laugh.


Even if you don't think of yourself as a particularly funny person, there are still ways to make her laugh. Try the ""push-pull"" technique. This essentially requires that you ""push"" her away by deeming yourself unworthy of her. If paired with a nice compliment, though, you'll be simultaneously ""pulling"" her toward you by expressing your interest. This will make things feel playful. A good example of the ""push-pull technique might be: ""You're a pretty cool girl, too bad you're stuck with me.""

, Anytime you disconnect from the conversation, whether this is poor listening or diverting attention away from her, you lose your charm factor. Being charming with a woman often just requires proper attention, making it no different than any conversation you'd have with another person.Respond directly to her reactions. Nod when she nods, laugh along with her, and mirror her behavior without copying her completely. This should be a fairly natural thing, but if you're having trouble being charming, be as sensitive as possible to her mannerisms.

Push away from the kiss.,
Create some physical distance.,
Stay calm.,
Firmly reject the kiss.,
Consider offering an explanation.,
Create some emotional distance, if necessary.,
Get help if you feel threatened or harassed.",How to React to a Stolen Kiss1," Before doing anything else, break out of the kiss by either pulling yourself away or pushing the other person away. Do not passively wait for the kiss to end, since the other individual involved may take this as an invitation to continue or deepen the gesture.


In most situations, you should be able to pry yourself away without using much force, especially if the kiss is only a quick peck on the lips. Lightly grab the other person at the front of the shoulders and straighten your arms, using the momentum to gently back away and ease the other person away from you.
If the other individual is more aggressive, a more aggressive response might be required. Start by using more force to actively push the other person away with your hands/arms. Don’t be afraid to use your arms to break the other person’s hold on you, or to kick the other person away if there’s no other way to break contact.;
, Once you’ve ended the kiss, take a few steps away from the other person to create obvious physical distance. Doing so protects you from another stolen kiss while also sending clear nonverbal clues about your feelings toward the kiss.A few steps should be all it takes if the other person has innocent intentions. If desired, you may wish to hold up your hand to further emphasize your desire for space or turn your face away to make it clear that you don’t want another kiss.
Of course, if the other person is aggressive, the safest thing you can do is to completely remove yourself from that individual’s presence.

, Unless you’re in physical danger, the best thing to do is to stay calm. Evaluate the person involved and the circumstance. It’s possible that the stolen kiss is the result of a misunderstanding, in which case, a calm rejection will likely have the best outcome. If the stolen kiss is a more serious violation of personal space, staying calm will still make it easier for you to express yourself clearly and firmly.


Take a few deep breaths. Inhale and hold for several seconds, then exhale over several seconds. Several repetitions of mindful breathing can help calm your nerves and clear your head.
Before verbalizing your response, try to evaluate the other person's motives by taking a mental step back and looking at the situation objectively. Asking why something happened from an objective perspective may make it easier to gauge an appropriate response.If you were on a date that was going well, it's possible that your date misread you and believed the desire to kiss was mutual.
If a friend kissed you without warning, it's possible that your friend has been harboring unreturned feelings of romance for you and momentarily stepped out of line.
If someone you've rejected, don't know, or don't get along with steals a kiss, that person may have done so to intentionally upset or harass you.



, Depending on the circumstances, you may find yourself feeling bad if you have to tell someone you disliked being kissed. Nevertheless, a firm verbal rejection of the kiss is the surest way to prevent it from happening again.If you’re dealing with someone who harbors unreturned feelings toward you, clearly state that you don’t share those feelings and don’t want this incident to happen again: “I’m flattered, but I don’t have romantic feelings for you and don’t want to kiss you.”
If you’re not ready to kiss someone you’ve started dating, but might be open to the idea later, clarify your position accordingly: “I really like you, but I don’t feel ready to kiss you at this stage of our relationship. I’ll make sure you know when I’m ready, though.”

, An explanation is never a requirement, but depending on your relationship with the other person involved, it might be worthwhile to explain why you don’t want to be kissed to that individual. Be gentle yet firm, and express your thoughts and feelings as clearly as possible.If you suspect the other person kissed you out of spite or for other ignoble reasons, it might be best to skip the explanation and part ways.
On the other hand, if you’re rejecting a friend’s feelings for you or explaining why you don’t feel comfortable kissing your date, an explanation, about why you feel the way you do, might help to limit hurt feelings and prevent the situation from reoccurring. , Rejecting a kiss can sometimes result in hurt feelings, especially if it also means rejecting someone’s unreturned affections. To give the other person time to heal while also underscoring your lack of desire, it might be best to spend time apart and avoid circumstances that could lead to further misunderstandings.


Avoid hanging out with this person for a while, especially if other people won’t be around. When you do start hanging around each other again, avoid flirtatious behavior and make sure that both sides are aware of one another’s boundaries.
Don’t be too surprised if the other person no longer wants to spend time with you. Even if that individual respects your feelings, the pain of rejection can make it hard to continue an ongoing relationship/friendship, and letting go might be the best thing for both of you., If the person who stole a kiss is aggressively persistent or threatens you in any way, seek help from an appropriate authority figure. A stolen kiss might seem innocent enough, but someone who shows a serious lack of respect for your feelings and your personal space could escalate the matter into something far more serious next time.A forced, unwanted kiss might even be considered a form of sexual harassment or sexual assault, depending on the laws of your municipality. This is especially true of the behavior continues after you make your wishes known. Don’t be afraid to report the incident to the local police if you feel unsafe."

This is an excellent way to broach the subject of role playing and can be a sexy experience for both of you.If the thought of mentioning role playing to your partner in a face-to-face conversation is completely terrifying, then send your lover an email or text that details your erotic fantasy.;
, If this is your first time role playing with your partner, it is a good idea to keep it simple. Do not choose an elaborate role that requires a lot of “acting.” Instead, you could pretend that you are strangers who are meeting for the first time. Meet at a restaurant for dinner and then head to a hotel afterwards for a night of role playing fun!, Choose roles that allow you to incorporate different power dynamics. This type of sexual role play is a common turn on for many people. For example, you could try Professor/Student, Doctor/Patient, or Police Officer/Criminal roles. In these types of scenarios you can incorporate mild punishment for any ""naughty"" behaviour., Some people like to borrow ideas from their favourite fiction or television shows. These roles often require more elaborate costumes, but can be a lot of fun to play around with. Try acting out a sexy scene from Game of Thrones, or create your own erotic spin on stories like Harry Potter, Twilight, or any superhero movie.

, Once you have decided on the roles you want to play, it is important that you and your partner discuss exactly what it is about this scenario that turns you both on. This will help to ensure that the fantasy plays out the way you want. For instance, a lot of people may have a student/teacher fantasy, but some people may be into a punishment scenario that involves rulers and spankings, while other people might be into plaid skirts and forbidden affairs., Before you and your partner get lost in character, it is important that you both know what you are comfortable doing. This is especially true if you are playing with a punishment scenario. For example, you may find that a light spank turns you on, but choking is off the table. Alternatively, anal sex or certain sex toys may be off limits for you.Have an open and honest conversation with your partner.
If you are shy about discussing these details in person, you could establish the rules electronically via email or text.

, In order to ensure, that things don’t get carried away while role playing, you and your lover should establish a safe word prior to beginning.

Depending on the type of role play you will be engaging in, your costumes could range from sexy lingerie to more elaborate doctor and nurse outfits.It is best to keep it simple in the beginning.

Alternatively, you could grow or shave your facial hair, or wear an outfit that is not your traditional style.
A small physical change can make you feel like someone different and will help you get lost in your character.

, Certain props can also help you get into character while acting out your role. For instance, if you are pretending to go to a massage parlour, you could try lighting candles and playing soothing music. Alternatively, if you want to act out a police officer fantasy, you could use a pair of handcuffs.

, The location can also help to set the mood. Try booking a hotel room for the night if you want to pretend that you and your partner are complete strangers just meeting for the first time. You may also feel more comfortable acting out a role if you are not in a familiar place. Alternatively, if you are trying a more elaborate role, you may want to use your own home so that you can decorate or include props to help set the scene.

, Remember, no one is judging your acting. You are likely going to be nervous in the beginning. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Try and stick with a role that you are familiar with so that the dialogue will come easily. For example, if you have worked as a nurse in the past, you may feel more comfortable role playing as a health care professional.If you are confident in your acting ability, you could try a more elaborate role and talk with an accent.

, When role playing for the first time, you are apt to break character and laugh a few times. This is okay and you should not let one slip up ruin the experience. Instead, laugh a little and then continue with the scenario. This nervous laughter will likely go away quite quickly., You will likely find that with role playing the planning and anticipation can be just as sexy as the actual event. Enjoy the process and take things slowly."

Dress well.,
Be hygienic.,
Pick a great spot to start.,
Eliminate any extra stress.",How to Romance a Girl2," Don't underestimate the power of your attire. Although fashion sense isn't everything, wearing sharp clothes will prove your respect for your girl and show off your social mobility.If you wear clothes that showcase your style and personality, you'll also get a nice positive mental boost. This will help you carry yourself with more confidence. Because you're in the initial stages of the relationship, you'll both be trying to impress. If she'll get dressed up for you, then you definitely have to meet her in your own dressing up.


For a dinner date, especially if you live in an urban location, you'll probably want to wear some sort of jacket. This could be a blazer or a sport coat; whatever you'd prefer. In certain situations, a full suit and tie may even be appropriate. If you're going out at night, it's better to overdress. You can shed the coat and let your date wear it if it gets too cold.
If you're worried about looking overdressed, it's hard to go wrong with a fitted collared shirt, jeans/khakis, and a nice pair of shoes.It's a tried and true look, and it's one that strikes a nice balance between formal and comfortable. Make sure that the shirt isn't wrinkled and that your pants are clean and without any rips. For the shoes, you'll want to be sitting in some place between your weekend sneakers and dress shoes.

, While being clean is always important, you definitely don't want to skip any steps when getting clean before a big date. It's definitely not enough to cover up your stench with body spray and cologne. Because you'll be spending an entire night with her, you'll want to cover all of your bases in respect to your hygiene. Some steps that you might miss include:


Floss every day. Your dentist will definitely thank you for this one. This extra step will not only help prevent gum disease, but will also dramatically improve the smell of your breath. Getting an electric toothbrush isn't a bad idea either.
Wash your feet. Doing this every day will help eliminate the need for more dramatic measures, like foot odor spray. This will require more than simply letting your feet soak in water, though. Get a wash cloth, rubbing between your toes and on the bottoms of your feet.
Change your sheets and pillowcase weekly, if not more. This is one that many guys forget about. It's important even if she doesn't come over to your place afterwards. Clean sheets will help you eliminate acne, or worse, bacne.

, It's important to have a clear plan for your first date, especially if the plan involves multiple locations. You'll definitely impress her if you've plotted out some ideas for the entirety of the night, and it'll feel more like an adventure. Make sure that you've chosen a place with great atmosphere. This might include music selection, decor, and noise level; make sure you don't go to a place where you won't be able to hear her talk.


Seating is huge for a first date. Your best bet is to find somewhere with bar stools, even if you're doing a full dinner. You'll be closer to her and both of you will be able to be more physically animated. Couches also work well, and a table can be fine. Try to avoid booths if you can. You'll sink into them, and it's easy to get stuck.
While dinner and drinks are fairly common for a first date, there's no need to limit yourself to just that.Bar trivia nights have a great deal of potential, as both of you can unleash your knowledge about a wide range of topics. You'll also be working together as a team, which will ally you from the beginning. Bowling is both competitive and extremely calming, and you can engage in some friendly competition. For the more daring, cooking and salsa classes might be an exciting first step.

, Your date will definitely fall flat if you enter with an excess of anxiety. You don't want to bring all your personal issues into a date. It'll make it difficult to ask her about her interests or keep up a positive attitude. Try reducing this stress by meditating or exercising, if you have time.If you're stressed out about the date itself, there are ample ways to reduce those negative feelings. You don't want to sabotage the experience from the get-go.Make a list of deal-breakers and deal-makers. It's helpful to have a mental list of what you want from this particular date. Talk it out with a friend, especially one who has dating experience. And above all, make sure you're telling yourself that the date will go well. You'll never enjoy the experience if you don't believe that you will.

Be public with her.,
Impress her friends.,
Make her feel comfortable.,
Define the relationship.",How to Romance a Girl3," If you're projecting your relationship into the world, then you've definitely crossed a threshold of seriousness. This isn't just making out in public. Displaying your relationship with hand-holding or cuddling while with friends will prove that you're ready to be intimate with her. It also makes it clear to anyone around that you and her are together. No one will try anything with you or her, meaning that you're in it together.


This also might mean being ""public"" with your relationship using the internet. Posting photos with each other is definitely a step in your relationship. Because a great deal of socialization occurs on Facebook and Instagram now, it's important that if you're serious about your relationship, you aren't afraid to be share photos featuring the girl that you're seeing.

, After a few dates, she'll definitely be mentioning you to your friends, especially if things are going well. It's only a matter of time before you meet them, and you have to be prepared to impress. It shouldn't feel very different from your initial date with her. Dress well, ask questions about her friends' interests, and be charismatic without schmoozing.


It's very important not to be too touchy with her around her girlfriends. They may not be comfortable seeing you two all over each other. It should feel different to socialize with her friends, and you have to be sensitive to them, as well as her. If you treat them like friends, then they'll slowly become your friends.
Even though her friends will probably have temperaments that align closely to hers, you definitely don't want to offend them.Avoid inflammatory topics like politics on the first meeting. You also shouldn't get too graphic or offensive. She might have an inappropriate sense of humor, but you don't know if her friends will. It's best to play it safe and leave the filthy stuff at the door.

, Once you've gotten past the initial stages of dating, she'll have made it clear that she's interested in you. At this point, you can worry less about impressing her and more about making her trust you.Soon enough, she will look to you to protect her from emotional harm. If you don't have the capacity to care for her, then your relationship probably won't progress into anything more than a casual fling.


She'll be able to trust you if she knows that you've been listening to her. This means that you'll be able to remember a wide variety of details about her past or her current troubles. If she doesn't feel that you're really paying attention to her, then she'll quickly push you away. Remember that if you listen to her, she'll want to listen to you as well.

, If you're planning on actually things to the next level, you'll have to talk about your future as a couple.While the DTR conversation can be a daunting one, there's no way to move from casual dating to a more sustainable relationship without having it. Here are some tips for figuring out ""the talk."" Remember that there is no right or wrong way to have this conversation.


Assess how long it has been, as well as how often you see each other. This is where you can find some clarity. If you only see each other once or twice a week, then you may not feel the rush to talk. If you talk or see each other every day, however, you might want to move the DTR talk up sooner.
If you're both on the same page about sex, then you'll probably be able to prolong the talk for longer. When one of you wants to wait, however, this might make the talk more immediate. Remember that if you haven't decided that you're exclusive, you aren't exclusive.
When you do talk, make sure that you're blunt with your terms. ""Serious"" and ""casual"" have different definitions for everyone. Make sure that you're not just asking her about what she wants; it's also important that you also state what you want. You want to stand up for yourself without being insensitive.
Remember that the DTR talk is ongoing. Even though you may have come up with a temporary agreement about the state of your relationship, things will change over time. As long as you're honest with each other about shifts in your relationship, no one will feel deceived.

Gently pull away.,
Give yourself time to process your feelings.,
Verbalize your response.,
Reciprocate the kiss, if desired.,
Set boundaries for the future.",How to React to a Stolen Kiss2," Even if you enjoy the kiss your sweetheart stole from you, it can still be a good idea to back out of it and give yourself a chance to breathe. Doing so ensures that whatever reaction you have will be an honest one, rather than one caused by getting swept up in the moment.


Don’t be afraid of “ruining the moment” by pulling away from a kiss. If you maintain physical closeness while preventing your partner from kissing you again, the action may actually increase feelings of desire in both of you.On the other hand, breaking physical contact completely would give you a better chance to evaluate your thoughts and feelings, which can be important if you aren’t yet certain about your feelings regarding the stolen kiss. This is ultimately more important than the risk of ruining this one particular moment.

, Depending on the circumstances, this may only take a few moments or it may take a few hours to days. It’s important to not rush yourself. Honestly ask yourself how you feel about the kiss—i.e. whether you enjoyed it or not—and determine if you feel that it was acceptable behavior for your relationship.


If you already have a fairly intimate relationship, it may not take much time to process your thoughts. Your gut may instinctively know that you do or don’t like the kiss.
If your relationship is still somewhat new, you may need more time to think things through. Let your partner know that in a calm yet straightforward manner: “Wow, I wasn’t expecting that. Can you give me some time to figure out how that makes me feel? My mind is spinning right now.”

, Regardless of whether your reaction is favorable or unfavorable, it’s probably a good idea to give your sweetheart a verbal response to the kiss. Use your best judgment to determine if this response should be brief or lengthy.


If you liked the kiss and figured that out quickly, brief confirmation is probably all you’ll need to give: “That was amazing!”
If you took a little longer to work out or feelings or if you don’t feel comfortable with stolen/surprise kisses, sit down with your partner after the moment has passed and clearly explain both how you feel and why you feel that way to avoid future misunderstandings.

, If your response to your sweetheart’s kiss is a favorable one, you might consider planting a kiss of your own to underscore your spoken feelings on the matter—but it isn’t necessary, of course, so don’t feel obligated to do so.


This kiss might be equal in kind—a peck on the lips for a peck on lips—or it may be even more passionate. Respond according to your own feelings and those of your partner.

, Regardless of whether you enjoyed the kiss or not, this might be a good time to set boundaries for your relationship. If stolen kisses are completely out of the question, be honest about that. If certain types of stolen kisses or certain circumstances are out of the question, be clear about that, too.


For instance, you may enjoy the occasional stolen kiss if it’s only a quick peck on the lips in private, but that doesn’t mean you have to feel equally comfortable with something more intense (e.g., a French kiss) when you don’t have warning, nor does it mean you need to be okay with the surprise kiss when you’re in front of your family or out in public.

Never feel obligated.,
Learn to say “no” without feeling guilty.,
Make your feelings and boundaries known.,
Avoid unfavorable circumstances.,
Turn away from an incoming kiss you don’t want.",How to React to a Stolen Kiss3," It’s important to realize that you are never obligated to engage in any sexual contact with another person, even if that contact is something as seemingly innocent as a kiss. Your body is your own; nobody else has a right to intrude upon your personal space or to force any form of contact with you. Realizing this is an essential part of preventing someone from stealing a kiss in the future., Rejecting someone who wants to kiss you can be a difficult thing, and if you aren’t able to issue your rejection quickly, it’s possible that the other person may react before you have a chance to gather your thoughts. Learning to say “no” in this and all areas of your life can help you ward away unwanted contact.


Practice saying ""no"" in everyday circumstances that have nothing to do with romance. Turn down plans to hang out with your friends if you aren't in the mood to go out. Tell someone ""no"" if you're asked to take on a project or favor you don't have the time or energy to complete. Building up familiarity with the ""no"" word can make it easier to use in the heat of the moment., Always try your best to be clear about your wants, especially when romance is involved. If you don’t have feelings for someone who has them for you, make your stance clear. If you aren’t ready for physical contact in a relationship, even if it’s “only” kissing, draw that line as clearly as possible.


Clarify what ""consent"" means when you go out on a date with someone new or pursue a relationship with someone you're interested in. In addition to ""no"" meaning ""no,"" it's also important to recognize that only a ""yes"" means ""yes.""Verbal confirmation of consent is important, especially early in a relationship, but you should also discuss nonverbal signs of consent with your partner.

, Avoiding situations that may lead to misunderstandings can prevent stolen kisses of a fairly innocent nature, and avoiding situations that could put you in compromising positions with unreliable people may prevent stolen kisses of a less innocent nature.


Don’t flirt with someone who you have no romantic interest in, especially if you suspect or know that individual has feelings for you.
If someone makes you uncomfortable or if you don’t know someone well enough to establish trust, avoiding being alone with that individual.

, If you find yourself with someone who’s interested in you romantically and you don’t want to kiss that person, be on the lookout for nonverbal (or verbal) indicators of an oncoming kiss. Ideally, your partner will be able to tell that you aren’t interested and will react in a respectful way; however, if your partner does lean in for an unwanted kiss, watching out for the behavior will make it easier to turn away from it.


Shake or turn your head away when your partner leans in for an unwanted kiss. This signal should be clear, and may make your partner feel less hurt than physically pushing him or her away.Explain or restate your feelings about kissing this individual. Let your partner know what you're comfortable with doing, and if the situation would benefit from an explanation, be honest about your feelings and reasons for those feelings.

Pick the perfect outer garment.,
Wear the right undergarments.,
Put on a pair of killer shoes.,
Have sultry hair.,
Wear sexy makeup.,
Dim the lights.,
Put a chair in the middle of the room.,
Prepare some sexy music.,
Let loose.",How to Perform a Striptease1," Before you plan your striptease, you need to find the perfect outer garment. Go through your closet, or even take a trip to a sexy-garment store, and find something that makes the most of your assets. It could be a conservative suit that leaves a lot to the imagination, or a sexy summer dress. Here are some things you should keep in mind as you search for the perfect outfit:


Pick something that you can easily take off. Don't pick something with a thousand unwieldy buttons that will take an hour to remove, or something that's so tight that you need a forklift to remove it from your cleavage.
Pick something that's sexy, but not so provocative that you leave nothing to the imagination.;
, Your undergarments need to be just as sexy as your actual outfit. Pick a bra that makes your cleavage stand out, and tight black underwear or a thong. Consider underwear that's lacy or slightly see-through.


Stockings with garters are a must for a striptease. You can go for classic fishnets, garters with a sexy pattern, or even garters with a racy seam up the back.

, Choosing a pair of shoes should be simple. The higher and thinner the heel, the better your calves and legs will look. Black shoes work best for a strip tease. Just make sure that the shoes are something that you can actually walk in. If you bought a new pair for the occasion, break them in a bit first.

, Your face and hair should look just as sexy as the rest of your outfit. Let your hair hang down your back, or pull it in a loose bun that you can unravel during the striptease. Your hair should look slightly messy and sexy, but still clean enough for any man to want to run his hands through it.

, Wear dark shadow that brings out your eyes, black mascara, and a dark red lipstick or lip gloss that makes your lips look luscious and kissable. You don't have to go overboard on the makeup, but you should wear more than you do naturally -- stripteases are not an everyday affair.

, Now that you have your sexy outfit and look, turn down the lights by leaving most of them off, throwing a light scarf over your lamps, or just by lighting a few candles.

, Whoever heard of a striptease without a chair? Pick a chair with a back and one that you can comfortably plant a foot on.

, If you want to kick your routine up a notch, turn on some sexy R&B, or whatever music gets you in the mood. Pick something that won't be too slow or too fast -- your striptease will have to keep the pace of the music. If you're playing music, make sure you have enough so that you don't run out of tunes just as you reach the crescendo of your strip tease.

, As you get ready to show off your stuff, you have to remove all inhibitions. Visualize your sexiest self and prepare to get to work. If you have any doubts about your body or your performance, it'll show on your face the second you step under the spotlights. And if you need a glass of wine or two to work up to it, then hey, who's judging?

Surprise him.",How to Romance a Man," Every man loves a massage, even if he doesn't ask for one. Many men are too shy to tell you what they really want, and if you and your man are alone and you can tell that he feels a little tense or know that he's been hunched over his desk or a computer all day, then give him a little shoulder, back, and neck massage to relieve some of that tension. He'll feel great and will see that you really care about him. This can also inspire him to give you a massage, so everybody wins!;
, If your man is a die hard 49ers, Jets, Nets, Devils, or whatever fan, surprise him with tickets to the next game that he's been really wanting to go to. If you like sports or think he'd like the company, go with him, or even say that the tickets are just for him and his best friend, to show that you're okay with him having some guy time. He'll really appreciate the gesture and will feel like you care about him. You don't have to be a sports fanatic to be interested in the things he cares about.

, Don't force him to sit through two hours of home cooking when he'd rather be having a burger and fries, but do pick the right time to luxuriate over a delicious, tasty meal prepared by you and you only. You can surprise him and say that you're just making ordinary pasta and a salad when you're really preparing his favorite meal, whether it's lasagna, steak, or whatever floats his boat. Bring some fine wine or ales into the picture and your man will be floored.

, There's no need to give big, fancy and elaborate gifts to your man just to show him how much you care about him. Instead, it really is the thought that counts, and giving him a small token of your love when he least expects it can be far more powerful than the gift of a new record player. Instead, get him that record he's been trying to find forever, find him a rare t-shirt with his favorite band's logo on it, or get him a new nice ballpoint pen when his old one runs out of ink. He'll be romanced and touched by the gesture.

, Nothing can make a man swoon faster than a sweet note left at the right place at the right time. Whether you're getting up and leaving the house before he does, or just leaving him a note at his place, take a minute to write him something sweet that shows that you're thinking of him and leave it in a place where he's likely to find it soon, whether it's on his computer, his mirror, or on his car window. He'll be touched by the gesture, and by the fact that you're thinking of him when you're apart. This will definitely show you care more than a text message!

, When your man is busy and stressed out, take the time to notice how you can help him get through his day more easily. Whether you're washing the pile of dishes in his sink, picking up lunch, or dropping off his dry-cleaning for him, you can surprise him with the gesture, and romance him by showing you care. Sure, cleaning a pile of dirty dishes may not sound romantic, but the fact that you put some thought into helping him out will sweep him off his feet! Plus, this will give him the idea to do favors for you when you need some help in return.

, Sometimes, nothing will make your man feel more romanced than if you show up at his place holding his favorite treat, whether it's the delicious deep-dish pizza form the other side of town, scones from his favorite bakery, or the delicious milkshake that he loves more than any other dessert on the planet. This will show that you're put thought into what he likes and that you've made an effort to make him happy. Bonus points if he's been holed up at home, working or studying, without having time to step out to get anything too eat.

, Sure, watching The New Girl or Survivor together may not feel like the most romantic time of your relationship. So why not spice it up by giving your man a nice foot massage instead of just sitting on the couch together? Put his feet on your lap and give them a nice, thorough massage, and he'll be blown away.

, When your man is taking a shower, quietly sneak in and write ""I love you"" or another sweet message in the mirror. When he gets out, he'll see your special words written over the steamy glass and will feel truly touched. This works best if the bathroom is a bit larger and you don't freak him out if he catches you in there.

, Check out the concert schedule for his favorite band and surprise him with tickets before he even knows they're coming to town. He'll appreciate the gesture and the effort you made to make him happy, and will definitely be romanced, even if his favorite band is decidedly something unromantic. Sometimes, getting him a gift that can lead to an amazing experience is better than a gift that can lead to instant gratification.

, If you want to really romance a man, then you two can't just live completely separate lives. You have to make an effort to be interested in some of the same things, whether you watch the same show together or love cooking together on Wednesday nights. Finding a few things that you can both care about, and which makes both of you think about your relationship and your relationship only, can definitely make a man feel romanced. You should find something that would genuinely interest both of you instead of forcing him to take a dance class or to do something else just to please you.

, If you want to show your man that you really care, then you have to make an effort to touch him when you're together. This doesn't mean it has to be anything inappropriate or sexual. Just touch him on his arm, the small of his back, or on his knee when you're sitting together, or give his hand a little squeeze from time to time. You don't have to go into major PDA mode (not a favorite for many guys) to show him that you care about him and that you love being around him.

, There are plenty of ways to romance a man when you're not even around. Once way to show him that you really do love and care about him is to be okay with him having a night out with his boys. Don't get jealous, text him every two seconds, or ask if any women are going to be there; just show him that you trust him to behave responsibly while hanging out with his buddies. He'll see that you really do love him and want him to be happy, and will be even more excited to hang out with you the next day.

, Men like to feel special just as much as women do. Let him know that you think he's sexy, smart, or the most amazing man you've ever met. Whatever you're feeling, don't make him play mind reader and let him know from time to time, so he really does feel special in your presence. He'll feel like you really do care about him and like you've taken the time to think about what makes him so amazing. If you're having sex, don't be afraid to compliment him in bed, too; men love to hear it!

, When you're apart for a little while, don't just go MIA and make him think that you don't care about him. Without being overbearing, just give him a quick call, text, or email to ask how his day is going and to show him that you're thinking of him. This doesn't mean you should call him when he's in the middle of a crazy day at work or a stressful family situation, but that you shouldn't make him feel like you've forgotten him completely just because you're not together.

, Maybe your man is completely obsessed with the Lakers or Game of Thrones. It's okay if you just can't get on the bandwagon, but it doesn't mean you have to ignore his obsessions. You don't have to watch the Lakers game with him, but you can shoot him a text to see how the game went later, just to show that you're thinking of him and know it's important to him. If you see him after his TV show, ask if it was a good episode. These small questions can go a long way in making him feel like you care about him -- and the things he cares about.

, It's easy to feel overwhelmed by all of the things you have to get done instead of focusing on the man you care about. However, if you want to really romance him, you have to make time just to look in his eyes, whether it's in the middle of a conversation or when you're just hanging out together. If you live together, especially, it can become habit to shout at each other from different rooms instead of really making the effort to look into each other's eyes while you're having a meaningful conversation.

, If you want to show that you care, then sometimes the best way you can show it is through your silence, not your words. When your man is trying to tell you something, take the time to really listen and process what he has to say instead of trying to find a solution right away or comparing what he's saying to your own experiences. Even if you feel like you've found the perfect solution for his problem, don't interrupt him and let him finish. This will show him that you really care.

, When you're out on a date or just hanging out watching TV or going for a walk, shut your phone off so you can give your man all of your attention. Nothing is more annoying than a girl who is constantly texting her friends while you're supposed to be hanging out, or who browses the web to fact-check every little thing you talk about. The next time you're together, shut that phone off for a few hours. You'll see that the world won't stop just because you can't check your Facebook or Instagram every second of your date.

, Nothing beats a spontaneous weekend road trip after a long, hard week. Plan something simple and fun, like a trip to the beach or to a wooded area a few hours south. Or maybe there's a restaurant you've both been meaning to try, though it's four hours north. Just pack up your car, make a plan, and go for it. Or don't make a plan -- just get in the car and go wherever the wind takes you. You'll see that your man really appreciates the effort you've made and will breathe some more life and fun into your relationship.

, Plan something totally new for the two of you to do together, whether you're taking a sushi making class, learning Japanese together, or doing partner yoga for the first time. It doesn't have to lead to any major self-discovery or achievement, and you never have to do it again; just making the effort to try new things from time to time can go a long way in helping your relationship stay fresh and in continuing to keep up the romance.

, You shouldn't put on a ball gown if you're just sitting around the house all day, but if you're going on a date or just hanging out outside the home, make an effort to look nice and maintain your appearance so that your man sees that you've made an effort. You should both dress up to keep the romance alive and to maintain the passion and attraction of your relationship. And if you're not going anywhere fancy, to try to still maintain your appearance to show that you do care and so you both don't get complacent.

, Yeah, so most guys don't love the idea of taking ballroom dancing lessons with their ladies, but if you're out at a bar or a club and the music is pumping, drag him onto the dance floor for a song or two. Just moving your bodies together and enjoying the beats you hear will help you let loose and have a great time together. This will definitely kick up the passion and romance factor.

, To keep things interesting and to make sure your man always feels romanced, you should surprise him from time to time. A little unpredictability never hurt anyone, and if you plan a surprise picnic, surprise trip, or just a surprise activity you would never dream of doing before, your man will feel like he has been truly swept off his feet. Make an effort to do something spontaneous, completely unexpected, and incredibly exciting at least every few weeks just to keep stoking the embers of your romance.

You can include numerous activities and locations throughout your treasure hunt, but make sure to end it in the most special way imaginable.


Choose the spot where you had your first date or first kiss.
End your treasure hunt in a romantic hotel room setting.
Consider ending your treasure hunt at the spot where you and your spouse got engaged.;
, Create a list of all of the activities and/or locations that are meaningful to you and your partner, as these could be used in your treasure hunt. Use locations where you share amazing memories, include your partner's favorite coffee shop or restaurant, etc.


The longer you want your treasure hunt to be, the more steps you should have.
Make sure to keep the treasure hunt fun and interesting. If you make it too long, your partner may get bored or tired., Do you want to do the whole treasure hunt in your house? Do you want to plan it to be throughout your neighborhood? Do you want to create a treasure hunt around the entire city? Do you want your treasure hunt to last all day or just a couple hours? Do you want to include activities or do you just want to leave clues at numerous locations? Be creative, and remember to choose locations that are important to you and your partner.


Consider how your date will get around town. If they have a car, you can plan a larger scale treasure hunt. However, if they have to take public transit, walk, or ride their bike, you might want to plan your treasure hunt on a smaller scale.
Plan your treasure hunt so that it geographically makes sense. Don't make your date zig-zag around town. Plan each step so that you treasure hunt flows easily.

You can use the same type of clue throughout your entire treasure hunt, or you can incorporate all different types of clues.

, These clues should be special to your relationship, so include locations that are extremely memorable to you and your partner. At each place, you should leave another clue that leads to a new location. Consider adding rhymes to your clues to make the treasure hunt even cuter.


For example, simple clues could be:

The first place we kissed.
The place where we had our last tickle fight.
The place where we first said ""I love you.""Clues with riddles or rhyming could be:

This was a night I'll never forget, go to the place where our lips first met.
I know you love your morning cup of joe, ask your favorite barista for your next place to go.



, Make sure to choose locations that aren't too difficult to figure out, otherwise they may end up going to the wrong locations. For this approach, you may need to get employees involved at each location. If the locations are willing to participate, give an employee at each location the next clue to give your partner. For example, clues could be:


Your favorite restaurant.
Our Sunday fun-day location.
Our favorite ice cream spot.
To make clues, it's recommended to use bright, sturdy paper (like colored construction paper) so that your partner can easily find each clue.

, Use pictures of special memories, recognizable locations, and other specific things to lead your partner on a romantic treasure hunt. Tell them to follow each photo to get to the the next photo. For example, take photos of:


A photo of you two at a particular restaurant.
A photo of a certain dress / shirt you wore for a special occasion.
A photo of an inside joke that will lead your partner to a specific location.

, Individually wrap each gift and include a clue to lead them to the next gift. This will allow your partner to have fun trying to figure out what the grand surprise is as they unwrap each gift.


For example, your treasure hunt could lead your partner to a romantic massage that you've set up in your bedroom. Leave gifts such as candles, massage oil, a bathrobe, lotions, etc. in each step of your treasure hunt. Once they get to the final location, you'll be able to use all of these items for your final surprise., Whether you're writing clues, placing photos in special locations, or giving little gifts throughout your treasure hunt, you'll need to get all of the materials that you'll need to create your treasure hunt. Get these supplies when you're not with your partner so that they don't become suspicious.Whether you're writing clues or giving small gifts, you'll need to prepare all of the steps to your treasure hunt.
Consider numbering the each clue to make sure that you place the clues in order.

, Go to each of your treasure hunt locations to set up your clues. Tape your clues in place, use an object to weigh them down, hang them from a fence with ribbon, hang a banner from a tree, or have someone waiting there to hand out your clues to your partner. Each clue should be fairly easy to spot so that your partner doesn't have a problem finding it.


Consider getting your mutual friends involved to help deliver the clues to your partner in each location.
Consider hiring people to help deliver clues to your partner. These people could be dressed up in costumes to really take your treasure hunt above and beyond.
If you're setting up clues in stores, restaurants, etc., make sure to talk with the management to get their permission. Some of your clues may require the assistance of these stores, so make sure that they are willing to help.

, It's a good idea for you to do a test run of the treasure hunt so you'll know whether it works, if it's too easy or too difficult, and approximately how much time it takes to complete it. This will allow you to make any necessary adjustments before sending your partner on their romantic treasure hunt.


This will also help you determine what time you should be waiting for them at their final location.

, Now that you've set everything up, get this romantic treasure hunt started. Give your partner their first clue, and let them begin the journey. Make sure that you are waiting it the final location by the time they get there.

Stride into the room like a professional.,

Remove your skirt.,
Work your body.,
Kick off your shoes and take off your stockings.,
Put your shoes back on.,
Take off your bra.,
Take off your underwear.,
Kick off your heels.",How to Perform a Striptease2," Walk toward your partner by strutting like you're on a cat walk, moving one foot in front of the other with confidence. Hold your head high and keep your shoulders back, letting your chest be front-and center. Keep one hand on your hip.


You can even stop to gyrate your body over the side of a wall before you move toward the center of the stage.

, This is not the time to be coy. Maintain eye contact whenever you're facing your partner, and don't blush and look away. Keep your lips slightly parted, so they look even more sultry. And whatever you do -- don't laugh. No matter how silly or out of your comfort zone you feel, nothing will kill the mood faster.


However, you can give just the hint of a sexy smile whenever you're about to do something hot, like remove another article of clothing or caress your breasts.

, Turn away from the person and take off your top or dress as you continue to move your body. Then, turn around while holding the garment and making intense eye contact with the audience. Take the garment and gently throw it in your man's direction.


If you're wearing a dress, then skip the next step, but if you just took off a top, then move on to the next stage.

, First, gyrate a bit, by moving your hips up and down, and moving your hands up and down the sides of your body, caressing your hips and stomach. Then, turn around, bend slightly forward, hook your thumbs into your skirt, and bend with your backside toward your partner as you roll down your skirt.


Let your skirt fall to the ground and kick it aside.

, Move around some more, walking around both sides of the chair, pressing yourself up against the back, and continuing to move up and down while caressing your body. Toss your hair back, lick your lips, and maintain your sultry expression. Look up at the ceiling as you caress your breasts, and show what a great time you're having.

, Lightly kick off your heels while placing one foot on the chair, showing off your gorgeous legs. Make sure to keep your heels nearby -- you'll need them again soon. Stroke your leg with your hands. Then, slowly roll down the stocking and toss it to your partner or to the crowd.


Repeat this step with your other leg, until your legs are bare and all you're wearing is your bra and underwear.

, Gently lower your feet back into the shoes, one at a time. You can hold on to the chair if you need help, as long as you continue to look sexy. The striptease will be sexier if you stick to the heels.

, Unclasp the bra until it's just covering your breasts, and hold it there. Turn around to show off your bare back, and lower the bra and toss it to the side. First, cover your breasts with your hands, gyrate, and continue to caress them. Then, slowly move your hands off your breasts, and turn around so you don't show too much at once.


Turn back to face the person, and let them see your sexy body.

, Turn around and pull down your underwear, taking care to leave your shoes on. When you turn to the front, first, cover yourself with your hands, and then move them away from your private parts to caress the rest of your body. Let everyone see how sexy you are, when you move around wearing only high heels.

, Lick your lips and kick your heels across the room until you're completely nude. And then, prepare for whatever's next -- lots of tips from the crowd, or a sexy session with your partner.

Let her know you’re thinking about her even when you aren’t together.,
Be flexible and willing to fit into her schedule.",How to Make Your Girlfriend Like You More1," It doesn’t matter how busy you are – if you want to have a girlfriend you have to be willing to spend time with her.

Big Sur, California, In addition to mountains and the beach, you can also plan a getaway to a place that holds special meaning to you and your partner. Think about places you’ve camped before, maybe somewhere near where you met, or anywhere you share meaningful memories.

, After you’ve chosen your general location, you should hone in on a specific campground. The best sites for romantic camping are those that are secluded or sparsely visited. This way, you’ll have a quiet spot to enjoy each other’s company.If you’re going car camping, pick a spot toward the back of the campground – away from other campers.
If you’re visiting a national or state park, ask a ranger for recommendations about beautiful and secluded camping sites.
Ask friends who may have visited the region or park you plan on going camping in.

Acknowledge your open wounds.,
Challenge negative beliefs.,
Let go of the pain with a release ritual.,
Seek professional help.",How to Open Your Heart1," It’s nearly impossible to open your heart when you are still nursing old wounds. Healing requires acknowledging what hurts. Simply speaking your hurts aloud can impact the way you view them. Often, when things hurt, you may try to ignore them. The only way to move on is by acknowledging what happened.It’s time to admit that you were hurt and truly feel these painful emotions you have been suppressing. If your ex broke your heart by cheating, admit to it. You might say, “I was heartbroken when Sasha cheated. It really made it hard for me to trust again.”;
, Experiencing emotional pain can cause you to develop negative beliefs about all people. These beliefs become ingrained and, over time, close your heart to love. To heal, you must identify the thought patterns that cause you to shut others out.


For example, you think “Because my best friend neglected me when I most needed him, it’s best not to count on others.” As a result, you never let anyone in or ask for help when you need it.
Challenge this belief by asking yourself some questions: What evidence is there that makes this true? Is this belief always true? Am I considering the full picture about what happened? Does this belief promote happiness and well-being? Use these questions to attack the negative beliefs or assumptions you have built about others., In order to open your heart, you must risk letting go of the past. Holding on to all that’s happened before only weighs you down, making it harder for you to embrace new relationships and opportunities. Perform a ritual to release old hurts and invite in a fresh perspective.Write down in detail what happened to you and your reaction to the hurt. Then, write down the incident from the perspective of the other person who hurt you. Remember how they reacted and imagine how they must have felt. This helps you see the situation from a different perspective.
Once you have fully released the event by writing it down on paper, destroy the paper. Toss it into a fire, tear it into tiny pieces, or bury it in the woods. This symbolizes an emotional release. What happened in the past no longer has a hold on you.

, Doing the work of healing past hurts is upsetting and draining. If you find yourself stuck and unable to move forward, it may help to see a mental health therapist. This person can help you identify the traumas that are closing your heart and offer effective strategies for truly letting go."

Compliment him.,
Tell him you appreciate him.,
Display your affections.,
Give him your attention.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Feel Happy1," No matter what he says or how he acts about it, your boyfriend (like everyone else) appreciates hearing nice things about himself. We all seek validation for how we look and what we do, especially when it comes from someone we care about. It’s good for your boyfriend’s ego, his pride, and his happiness.Don’t make this more complicated than it needs to be. If you like the way he laughs, tell him. If you like the way he styles his hair or treats strangers politely, tell him. If you can compliment him on something you know he really cares about, like his basketball skills or his math grades, all the better.;
, Relationships are hard work, and require effort from both parties. Take note of the things he does for you and for the relationship, and let him know that you do notice and are thankful.Does he work a second job so he can take you out on nice dates or save money for an apartment? Does he go out of his way to pick you up so you don’t have to walk home in the rain? Is he nice to your mother? Specifically say to him “I appreciate that you do for me and for us.”

, Even if you have a guy that isn’t big on public displays of affection, there are always subtle ways to let him know how you feel. Actions usually speak louder than words when it comes to demonstrating affection.Hold his hand, and kiss him for no good reason. If he’s not the hand-holding type, let your hand brush against his from time to time, and maybe just slip him a quick peck on the cheek.
Even most modern guys like to feel like protectors, so putting your head on his shoulder or sitting on his lap is a good way to create a sense of him protecting you with his embrace.

, Simply spending time together is great, but make sure that you are putting your focus squarely on him for at least some of that time. That means putting your phone down, looking him in the eyes, and listening, talking, or just letting him know you’re there.Make your time together quality time — something you both enjoy and will remember. Life is busy and only seems to get busier, so don’t take your time together for granted. Go on a surprise day trip. Take a surfing lesson together. Just sit and talk with no distractions.According to esteemed relationship researcher John Gottman, healthy relationships tend to have a ratio of at least five positive interactions for every negative one. The more often you show interest, concern, appreciation, and affection, all of which start by paying attention, the better your odds of reaching the ""magic number"" of positive interactions."
"
Keep an open mind.,
Don’t be hateful.,
Compromise.,
Ask her opinions about other things.,
Respectfully disagree.",How to Make Your Girlfriend Like You More2," The worst thing you can be is stubborn. Understand that she is her own person and that you can’t push anything on her. Let her make her own decisions without constantly disagreeing with them.


For example, if she wants to get a tattoo and you really don’t like tattoos try to be open about it. Maybe you’ll end up thinking it is very attractive.

, When you’re in a very intimate relationship it can be easy to find yourself getting frustrated or being less patient than you normally would be. Never snap at the person.


For example, if you find yourself getting in a fight make sure you stay calm and civil to make it more of a debate than a fight. Don’t yell at her.

, You can always find a middle ground. You don’t have to be a pushover, but be willing to bend your stance if it helps the relationship. If you really care about her this shouldn't be difficult. Try to be easy going. For example if she really wants to see one movie and you want to see a different one, ask her if she might be willing to see the movie you want to see next weekend if you watch hers this weekend.

, Even if you disagree about one topic, don’t be afraid to ask her opinions about different topics. Not only will you get to know her better, but you’ll also show that you still really value her opinion even if you don’t agree about that one subject.

, If you are going to stick to your guns and continue to disagree with your girlfriend, make sure you do it in a respectful and nice way.


Say something like, “well I don’t know, I still think what I think – but you have made some really good points that I’ll have to consider.”

Spend more time doing the things she likes.,
Make her feel important and valued.,
Keep up the conversation.,
Plan ahead.,
Give her gifts.,
Make friends with her friends and family.,
Introduce her to your family.",How to Make Your Girlfriend Like You More3," Don’t insist that you go see the movie that you want to see, or spend the time at a place you like. Ask her the things she prefers to do and try to make sure you spend a lot of time doing those activities too. Don’t be afraid to show her something you like, but always keep track of how much fun she is having. Be fair. , Compliment her looks, her personality, her sense of humor, and everything else. Don’t overdo it, just be sure that you actually say it out loud when you feel one of those things. This will make her feel special and she’ll probably like you more.


For example, ""you're way better at math than I am. It's really nice dating someone so smart.""
Another example - ""I really like hearing your opinions about other people. You're always super perceptive.""

, If you have trouble starting a conversation with her, ask her how her day went or what she wants to do. Don’t be afraid to talk about whatever you have been thinking about that day, or interesting things that you saw. She’ll probably think it’s cool that you are sharing your life with her.

, Planning your dates ahead of time is a great idea. This way you'll have a chance to be more creative without the pressure of the moment. Try to avoid doing the same thing over and over again. For example, if you went to see a movie last weekend try going on a hike this weekend.

, It’s a cliché that girls need presents all the time, but it’s always nice to get a gift. Flowers are always appreciated, but you can also surprise her with a more personalized gift. If she really likes running, buy her a new running backpack or watch. You don’t have to do it on her anniversary or anything – gifts that come out of the blue are sometimes the nicest ones. , It’s important that the people who are close to your girlfriend think that you are a good person too. She’ll appreciate you taking the time trying to get to know the important people in her life and they might even end up putting in a good word for you. , It’s also important that she knows you are serious about the relationship. Introducing her to your family and acting proud of her will show her that you want this to work out long term. "

Serve breakfast in bed.,
Enjoy a hike and a lunch picnic.,
Have a candlelit dinner.",How to Plan a Romantic Camping Trip2," Plan to get up early before your significant other. Prepare breakfast as they sleep. Make sure to be quiet – if you need to go to a neighboring (empty) campsite, you should. Then, surprise your significant other with breakfast in bed.Cook their favorite foods, whatever that is.
Consider serving eggs, pancakes or rocky mountain toast, bacon, fresh fruit, and coffee.

, Pack a complete picnic, start out on a trail, and look for a scenic and romantic place to have lunch. Take your time, though. There is no rush. Use this opportunity to spend time with your loved one and find the perfect spot to enjoy your meal. When packing your lunch, make sure to bring:


Sandwiches
Some snack food
Tea or lemonade
A bottle of wine (if you’re not too far from camp)

, Whether you have a picnic table, a foldout camping table, or just the ground, use the opportunity to have a candlelit dinner under the stars. Spread a blanket on the floor (or on a table) and set up your candles, napkins, and silverware. Then, either cook for your partner or cook together.


Compliment your meal with a bottle of wine.
Follow your dinner by roasting marshmallows or making s'mores."
"
Make it about your partner.,
Take a hike.,
Go kayaking or canoeing together.,
Sit around the campfire.,
Stargaze and talk about life and the universe.,
Sleep in and snuggle.",How to Plan a Romantic Camping Trip3," When it comes time to picking activities, you need to largely consider what your partner likes to do. While it’s okay to plan some activities that you want to do, your goal should be planning activities that your partner and you will enjoy together. To accomplish this:Reflect on what your partner likes and doesn’t like.
If they know about the trip, ask them what they’d like to do.
If the trip will be a surprise, consider asking their friends or family what they might want to do.

, Ask the ranger or locals about beautiful and scenic places to hike. Then, set out with plenty of fluids and snacks for a romantic hike. Feel free to take it easy and enjoy the sights.


Hike down the beach around sunset.
Hike to a mountain vista late in the afternoon so you can enjoy the sunset over the mountains.

, Wherever you go, its likely you’ll be in proximity to a body of water where you can canoe or kayak. Depending on the setting, this could potentially be a very romantic activity.


Consider canoeing together. This way, you’ll be in the same boat, have to cooperate, and can stop whenever you want to chat, hold hands, or have a picnic on the water.

, Build yourself a nice small fire. Set up your camp chairs or sit together on a blanket. Choose an appropriate beverage, and enjoy the warm glow of your camp fire.


Play songs on your iPhone or another portable device or even sing together.
Use the opportunity to roast marshmallows or make some s'mores.

, Lay back in your sleeping bags outside of the tent and enjoy the stars. Talk about your lives, your love, and your plans. Let the conversation wander and don’t be afraid to express how you feel about your partner.

, There’s nothing more romantic than sleeping in with your partner, waking up, and snuggling for a while. You can also use this opportunity to watch wildlife or the sun rise. The most important thing, though, is to relax and take your time. Enjoy every moment of this slow morning."

Load up every accessory that could make camp life easier.,
Pack your tent and a lot of bedding.,
Bring a lot of food.",How to Plan a Romantic Camping Trip4," The goal of a romantic camping trip should be fun and comfort. As a result, there is no reason to do without (if you have space in your car). When packing, remember to bring:Camping chairs
A table
Things you need to cook (pots, pans, forks, knives, a cutting board, and more)

, Bring your tent, sleeping bags, lots of pillows, and some spare blankets. There’s no reason to do without anything -- consider bringing sleeping pads and anything else that could make your sleep time more comfortable., Your romantic camping trip should be an opportunity to enjoy meals together in the great outdoors. As a result, bring more food than you think you will need. After all, there is nothing worse than being out in the wilderness and getting hungry.


Bring breakfast supplies like eggs, bacon, and fresh fruit.
Bring stuff for lunch picnics like bread, lunch meat, mayonnaise, mustard, potato chips, and fresh veggies.
Bring dinner supplies like chicken, steak, and seafood. Also consider some fancy vegetables that could compliment a candlelit dinner, like asparagus or kale.
Don't forget to bring enough ice to last you."

Show compassion for yourself and others.,
Reconnect with your inner child.,
Be a giver, but be okay with receiving, too.,
Try new things.",How to Open Your Heart2," If your heart is closed, odds are you have a tendency to harshly judge and criticize yourself and other people. Learning to practice compassion can help you enhance your vulnerability and open your heart.


Be compassionate with yourself by extending forgiveness for your flaws and faults. Take ownership for your mistakes and refuse to hide them. Be gentle with yourself. Stop holding yourself to impossible standards.Be compassionate with others by remembering that they are flawed and human, too. Accept and forgive freely—don’t hold grudges. Aim to see the best in people rather than dwelling on their faults., A closed heart often translates to taking things very seriously. Lighten up a bit. Remember how you used to be before the world hardened your heart. Laugh. Dance in the rain. Tell silly jokes. Run through the meadows with bare feet.If you have trouble reconnecting with your inner child, spend some time hanging out with a small child. They will help you remember.

, Often when we close off our hearts, we also become selfish. You may have adopted a “me vs. them” perception of life and stopped willingly lending a hand to others. Vulnerable people have an attitude of giving. Not for credit, just because. However, you must also be willing to let your loved ones give to you, too.Ask a friend or family member what you can do for them. Say, “Is there anything I can do to make your day easier or better?” Similarly, if you are in need, have the courage to ask for help. Say, “I could really use another eye on this history paper. Do you mind looking at it once I’m done?”
You might also give of your time or money to charities or local volunteer organizations.

, Having a closed heart often means you have closed yourself off to challenges and new opportunities. When you are learning to be vulnerable, you can relax the reigns and not worry about doing everything so perfectly. Take on new challenges for the sheer enjoyment of learning something new.


Learn a new language. Sign up for a class as a total novice. Think of something you haven’t a clue of how to do and start reading on the subject. Put yourself out there and risk making a mistake."

Start a meditation practice.,
Let yourself cry.,
Deepen your connections with disclosure.,
Show affection.",How to Open Your Heart3," Meditation helps you learn to be mindful and aware of the moment as you’re in it. Beginning a regular meditation practice can help you tune in to your heart and help you open up to the world around you.


Try this 5-minute meditation: Sit comfortably in a place with no distractions. Take deep, cleansing breaths, in and out. Place a hand on your heart and the other on your belly. As you breathe in, imagine that you are pulling in all the good that the universe has to offer. As you breathe out, release any pain or worries you have been holding on to., A common mark of a closed-hearted person is their tendency to push away painful emotions. Practice open-heartedness by giving yourself permission to cry. Crying is cathartic and can actually be good for you.If you don’t have anything immediate to cry about, purposely watch a movie or read an emotional story. As you cry, don’t judge or criticize yourself. Simply be present in the moment as the tears fall. Then, offer yourself comfort with something like “I’m with you” and gently caress your back and shoulders.

, If your heart has been closed for a while, your relationships may be primarily surface-level. Practice letting others in by disclosing intimate details about yourself. Start light before revealing your deeper secrets to allow both you and the other person to acclimate to your newfound openness.For instance, you might choose to tell a friend “It really hurt my feelings when you canceled our plans at the last minute. I was really looking forward to hanging out.” If this mini-disclosure is met with acceptance and empathy, later, you might choose to share something more emotional like how you felt after a major loss in your life.

, As you get accustomed to opening up to others, you should challenge yourself to exchange physical touch. Hugs, caresses, and kisses are all ways humans show their love and affection. However, if you have previously closed your heart, these gestures may be foreign to you.When you and a friend are laughing, lightly touch their arm. If a coworker is crying, rub their upper back to offer comfort. Greet a relative with a hug instead of a handshake (if you’ve never done this, it may be appropriate to ask first). Touch is a major form of communication; start using it in your relationships.

Speak his language.,
Be honest with him.,
Give him his space.,
Don’t expect to change him.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Feel Happy2," Over the past twenty-plus years, many experts and laypeople alike have embraced relationship researcher Gary Chapman's concept that all people ""speak"" one or more of five ""love languages."" By identifying the language that fits your boyfriend, you will be better prepared to communicate effectively and show affection.Chapman's five ""love languages"" include: words of affirmation; quality time; gifts; acts of service; and physical contact. Depending upon their primary language, people are more receptive to acts of love that match that category. For instance, someone whose language is ""quality time"" will respond better to a long weekend together than a gift card to his favorite store.
Take note of the ways that your boyfriend responds to the different ways that you show affection. Once you determine which language he speaks, you can tailor your acts of affection to accordingly. He will in turn experience and appreciate your affection more fully.

, No boyfriend, girlfriend, or anyone else in a relationship is going to be truly happy if they don’t feel like they are trusted. Being honest, even when it is difficult, is one of the best ways to show trust.Sometimes the truth does hurt, and it may cause him distress when you speak honestly. But beneath that pain will be an appreciation that you trusted him enough to be honest with him.
Admitting to cheating on your boyfriend, for example, is probably one of the most difficult times to be honest. Don't put it off indefinitely, but do wait for a time when you are both calm and can speak without distractions. Choose your words carefully (practice beforehand if it helps), but don't be so vague that your point is not being made clearly. Start with something along the lines of ""I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but you deserve the truth,"" then admit your transgression without making excuses. Apologize and explain, but don't beg or demand forgiveness; say you hope he can forgive you.
If you’re afraid to tell your boyfriend the truth about something because you think he’ll break up with you, or are worried he may do something hurtful, then you may need to question the importance of the relationship anyway. If it can’t be built on trust and honesty, it’s not going to last, and neither of you will end up happy.

, Of course, a good boyfriend will want to spend a lot of time with you. But he’ll still want and need some time to himself or with his friends. So long as it doesn’t come to the point where he’s regularly ignoring you, let him have it.You like to have some time to yourself, right? Well, remember that trust is a two-way street. If you can’t let him have space to do his own thing, why should you expect it in return?
Every solid relationship requires some personal space. Some need more than others. So long as he’s with you when it counts — that is, when you need him, for a ride or for a shoulder to cry on — you should be glad. Don’t make him be with you, make him want to be with you.

, It is a sure thing that your boyfriend isn’t perfect, no matter how great he is. No doubt you find yourself thinking of the little things you’d like to change about him to make him even better. You can inspire people to change, or help them to change, but you should never expect them to change. If you can’t take him as he is, don’t take him.Maybe your boyfriend is a slob, or is always running late, or takes jokes a bit too far sometimes. You can talk to him about your concerns, and provide support if he wants to become better organized, more reliable, or more sensitive. But if you feel like you need to change the essence of who he is, then you probably aren’t with the right guy.

Make him happy.,
Keep up your appearance.,
Cook him a nice meal and let him watch sports.,
Satisfy his desires.",How to Make Your Boyfriend Feel Happy3," Yes, many guys do enjoy a good meal, love watching sports, and think about sex almost constantly. But, you aren’t trying to make “many guys” happy — you want to make your boyfriend happy. Showing that you know his particular wants and needs is perhaps the best way into a man’s heart.


The advice in this section may be applicable to your boyfriend, or it may not be. Take it with a grain of salt, and rely on your best judgment.

, Your boyfriend may be more than content to hang around with you while you’re in sweats, but deep down he probably wants to see you make the effort to get “fancied up” for him at least sometimes. At very least, keeping up with basic hygiene and showing that you care about how you present yourself to the world will probably make him happier.Yes, there is a superficial element to it, but your boyfriend almost certainly chose to be with you in part because he was attracted to your looks, and he wants to continue to be attracted to them. The longer you’re together, his love for you as a whole person will make your appearance on the outside beautiful to him no matter what. But, the fact that you’re putting in the effort to be attractive can show that you care about both yourself and him.

, This might be the ideal Sunday afternoon for many guys. If your boyfriend likes food and football, indulge him at least sometimes. Maybe he wants you to watch the game with him, or maybe he’d rather just watch it with his friends. Use your knowledge of him to decide what’s best.


Of course, maybe your guy hates sports and is on a strict diet. As mentioned, this isn’t “one size fits all” advice. However, the larger principle — giving your boyfriend what makes him happy sometimes, even if it is a bit annoying for you — remains true for most any type of guy.
All relationships require some sacrifices and compromises. Sometimes you have to let him have things his way, in spite of your instincts. Of course, you deserve to expect the same from him as well., Yes, we’re talking about intimate relations here. Most guys think about sex a lot, and want it a lot. Odds are, no matter how much (or how often) you give, he’ll want more. While you should never feel obligated to do anything you’re not ready for, satisfying his wants at whatever level of intimacy you are at is part of making him happy.Many guys have an amazing capacity to ignore tiredness, stress, or a whole host of other obstacles or problems when there’s an opportunity for some romantic action. Your boyfriend may well be “in the mood” far more often than you are. Try to meet him in the middle.
Of course, no matter how long you’ve been together, no matter what you’ve done or not done, you always have the right to say no. If he can’t accept that, get a new boyfriend.

, Think of what good characteristics they have in them- are they funny? Smart? Caring? This is helped a lot by Step #1- you can 'choose your attributes'. But if you can't choose your person, and you dislike that person, try to be a little more accepting of his/her ways.

, Whether you're trying to convince the subject of your affections or someone else, you'll be expected to seem in a better mood when he/she is around.

, When people have crushes on other people, they tend to be louder to try to get the attention of their crush. You'll want to imitate this. Talk louder, laugh louder, smile more, move a bit more when you're talking to other people. Make this change obvious to any looker-on.

Help her with chores.,
Do something new with her.,
Attend her events.",How to Make Your Girlfriend Feel Loved," Almost everybody enjoys receiving compliments. Giving your girlfriend a compliment lets her know what you admire and love about her. When giving her a compliment, try to make it as specific as possible. Think about what is unique about her. A specific compliment will be remembered longer and appreciated more than a general compliment that could be given to anyone.Say things like “I really like the outfit you have put together today,” or “I’m really impressed by your taste in books.”
Think about something you haven’t complimented her on before. Maybe she does a great job of handling all of her responsibilities. If she has gotten her hair done recently, notice it and compliment it.
You don’t have to constantly compliment her. Too many compliments can seem insincere after a while.
If your girlfriend is insecure about certain things, like her body or looks, compliment her to raise her confidence about them.;
, Talking about your emotions can be difficult to do, but it will almost always be appreciated. Expressing your emotions about the relationship will vary depending on the type of relationship and how long you have been together. Tell her that you love her, appreciate what she does, and value her in your life. Let her know how she has made you better as a person.If is a fairly new relationship, you can say “I’m so happy I’ve been able to get to know you. I hope I can get to know you even more as our relationship progresses.”
It never hurts to let your girlfriend know how much you appreciate having her in her life, even if it is an established relationship.

, Making the effort to include your girlfriend in your plans and daily life means a lot. You don’t have to fully include her into every part of your life if it is a new relationship. Choose what you include her in based on what you are comfortable with and how serious the relationship is. If it is a new relationship, ask her to hang out with your friends during the weekend. If you are more serious, bring her to family functions or on a trip.What you include her in doesn’t have to be that important or serious. It is just as nice to invite her to run errands with her. Letting her know you think of her and want her around is what counts.

, Remembering the small things sometimes means just as much as remembering the big things. This is because it is surprising and shows how much you pay attention to her, her life, and your relationship. Pay attention to the small events and remarks, like something she says she likes or doesn’t like, a childhood memory that means a lot to her, or remember the details about how you met her.You can also remember her favorite movies, songs, books, and/or plays and watch or read them with her later.
Remember the details about the relationship. For example, remember where you first held hands, first kissed, or a favor she did for you that meant a lot to you.

, Remembering the small things means a lot, but it is also very important to not forget the big dates. Forgetting a big date can result in hurt feelings and possible an argument because those dates are expected to be remembered. A few important dates to remember are your anniversary, her birthday, and holidays, especially her favorite holidays.Show her dates like her birthday and Valentine’s Day are important to you by planning a celebration or date.
Make sure you don’t forget dates by writing them in a planner or calendar or putting them into the calendar on your mobile phone.

, Your girlfriend doesn’t have to determine what you do and don’t do in your life, but it is thoughtful to ask for her opinion. It shows that you value what she thinks, and you want to apply your advice in your decisions. You can ask for her opinion for something as simple as choosing what shirt to wear, or as big as moving to another location.Ask her something like “I’m thinking of getting a new shirt. Would you like to help me pick it out? I would like your opinion.”
You don’t have to only ask for her opinion on something personal. You can also ask for her advice on entertainment, the news, or whatever comes to mind.
You can ask her opinion, but you don’t have to take it if you don’t think it is beneficial to you. Only do what makes you feel happy and comfortable.

, You should listen to anyone that is speaking, but try to pay special attention to what your girlfriend is saying. Truly listening is not as common as it should be, so your girlfriend will appreciate having someone to rely on to listen to her. You don’t have always have to answer to what she is saying. Having someone to vent to is special.Look her into her eyes when she is speaking. If she is venting or working something out aloud, let her talk. You can show that you are listening by nodding occasionally and making small comments like “I understand.” Of course, you should respond when she asks something.

, Respond to her when you are having a conversation, but also respond to her when you talk through messages throughout the day. Acknowledge when she is speaking to you, even if it is a small question or comment that warrants a response. Respond to her carefully and with thought if it is a serious conversation. You should also try your best to respond to her when she texts, messages, or calls you.Don’t go out of your way to respond if the time is not appropriate, like when you are in class or at work. Respond to her when you can. She should understand that you are not always immediately available.

, You don’t have to be constantly connected with each other, but sending her a few texts and/or messages throughout the day goes a long way. It will mean a lot to her to know that you cross her mind even when you are apart. Text her when you see something that makes you think of her, or even just to say hello.You can also send her random text messages reminding her how you beautiful you think she is and that you love her.

, Calling is less common these days because texting and messaging through social media is easier and faster. Taking the time to call her will show that you value conversation with her, not just brief snippets of conversation through text. You can call her when you have a few minutes to spare throughout the day, or you can call her at night to have a longer conversation when you are not together.It is also nice to call her and say you just wanted to hear her voice.
If she does not answer, leave a message or send a text to let her know that you were thinking of her.

, Show her and speak to her with respect at all times. Do not call her bad names, even if it’s in jest. Avoid speaking negatively about her gender or make inappropriate jokes that could hurt her feelings. Never dismiss what she is saying, even if you are having an argument. If you are having an argument, try to think before you speak and avoid saying things you will regret later.If you are arguing, instead of resorting to name-calling or other negative language, say something like “I respect what you are saying, but I disagree. Can we try to come to a compromise?”
You don’t have to walk on eggshells when speaking to her. Just try to consider if it will hurt her feelings before saying what you have in mind.
Speaking to her with respect also involves respecting her interests and wishes. Even if you think ballet isn’t your thing, support her. If she tells you that you’re doing something that makes her uncomfortable, stop doing it.

, It is important to show your love through actions and kind words, but simply saying “I love you” never gets old. Tell her you love her every day, or whenever you feel the need to tell her. You can say it in person, through text, or by phone, though saying it in person is the most ideal way to say it. Don’t be afraid to tell her you love her if you have never told her before. It’s best to wait until you have been in a relationship with her for a while, but it is not wrong to express your feelings at any point. Don’t expect her to say it back, though. If she doesn’t say it back, it doesn’t mean that she won’t say it in the future.

, Holding hands with your girlfriend is a simple and sweet gesture that never gets old. It is an innocent gesture that is physical without being overly physical. Hold her hand while you are watching a movie. Take her hand as you walk down the street together. It will show that you are proud that she is your girlfriend.It’s okay if she expresses a dislike for holding hands. There are plenty of other ways to show affection.

, A hug is a bit more physical than holding hands, but it is usually appreciated. Always give her a hug when saying hello or goodbye. Unexpected hugs are great too. Give her a quick hug when you or out together, or give her a longer hug when you are spending time alone.If she says that she doesn’t like long hugs in public or during specific times, respect that and ask when physical affection is okay with her.

, A kiss is a simple act that can be powerful in showing her how you feel about her. If it is a new relationship, it can still be a new and exciting thing every time you kiss. Even if you kiss her regularly now, you can probably kiss her more often. Kissing is something that often becomes neglected in longer relationships. Pull her in and surprise her with a kiss. Or, kiss her somewhere other than her lips, like on her forehead, nose, or neck.Kiss her in public to show off how proud you are that she is yours.
Don’t feel pressured to kiss if you haven’t done it yet. Take things at a pace that you and your girlfriend are comfortable with.

, A massage after a long, stressful day is a thoughtful gesture. Massage her neck, back, or feet. You can also ask her where she would like to be massaged. Use your bare hands or add oils or lotions. You should massage her to help her unwind. Do not give her the massage with any expectations or ulterior motives.Massages can also be a method of seduction, but only do this if both you and your partner are comfortable and have talked about a sexual relationship.

, You can continue dating your girlfriend, even when you are in a relationship. Regularly go one dates with her to the movies, park, or dinner. A date doesn’t have to cost anything to be enjoyed. It’s the thought that matters. You can also plan a special date for her. It can be just because or for an occasion. Keep in mind her interests and things you enjoy doing together when planning a date.Going on a hike to someplace beautiful is a great way to spend time together without spending too much money.
Cook her dinner and plan to watch her favorite movie. The effort will mean more than taking her out to a fancy restaurant.

, You do not have to constantly give her gifts, but it is thoughtful to give her a surprise gift or a gift for a special occasion. You can make her a gift, like a painting or scrapbook with photos and memories of your relationship. It is also an option to make the gift something that you can do together, like attending a ballet or sports game she has dreamed of going to.Keep in mind things that she points or mentions that she would like to have. Write them down to remember them.
A great gift can be something like writing a poem or song to her.

, The small, mundane things are important too because they occur far more often than special occasions. If she is having a busy day, help her clean her room, kitchen, or bathroom. Offer to clean or do laundry for her, or make it something you can do together. Run a simple errand for her, like picking up milk if she ran out of it. You can also make a day of running errands together.


Spend a free day during the weekend catching up on each other’s errands, like getting groceries, paying bills, and shopping.

, Exploring new places and parts of life is a great bonding experience that will strengthen your relationship. It can be something neither of you have done, or something only one of you haven’t experienced before. You can get ideas for what to do by listening to her talk about things she would like to experience, or you can do something that is meaningful to you or her.Take a road trip to a place neither of you have visited before. Taking trips together is a good way of getting to know your girlfriend or boyfriend better, even if you have been together for a while.
Maybe seeing The Nutcracker is a cherished part of her childhood, but you have never been. That is something you can do together. If going to see a baseball team is something you love but she has never gone to a game, invite her to go with you.

, Show up to events that she takes part in. It might be a work event, wedding, game, or show. Supporting her in whatever she does will show how much you care for her. You can also invite her to events in her life. Letting her know that you want her there for support is a good way of showing that she is a part of your life.Ask her before attending a game or show she is performing in if she is shy. Surprise her by showing up if you think it will make her happy.
Accept her invitation if possible if she invites you to an event. If you can’t go, tell her that you wish you could and express your disappointment. Send her flowers or a note the day of the event to show encouragement from afar.

Look for signals.,
Make sure she looks happy and comfortable.,
Try a preliminary arm touch.,
Be physically close enough.",How to Put Your Arm Around a Girl1," If you want to put your arm successfully around a girl, the most important thing is to first make sure she wants you to. Have you hung out at least few times as more than friends? Has she been the one to extend an invitation to hang out? When you see her, does she smile, meet your eyes and look happy to see you? Do you text and talk to one another daily? If so, she’s probably ready for you to put your arm around her.If she seems to take every opportunity to “accidentally” brush up against you or otherwise make physical contact, she likes you.It’s pretty likely that she’s going to be thrilled if you put your arm around her.
If you’ve just met, or if you don’t know her well, wait.
If she’s flirting with you but that’s as far as it’s gone, you should probably wait until you get a few more solid signals from her first.;
, When you’re hanging out and you feel like it could be your moment, sneak a peek over at her. What’s her facial expression? Is she relaxed and happy? Does she look comfortable when she’s around you? Is she already leaning in close to you? These are all good signs that it’s time to make your move.


If she looks uncomfortable, stressed out or unhappy, it’s probably not a good time to put your arm around her, especially if you never have before.
Make sure she’s engaged in the moment.
For instance, if she’s immersed in her phone, not interacting with you at all, and not sitting remotely close to you, it’s not the right time.

, When you’re in the middle of a great chat or having a good laugh together, test the waters by quickly and lightly touching her on the forearm. How does she react? If she flinches or withdraws suddenly, trying to put your arm around her is a bad idea.However, if she meets your eyes, smiles, or moves in closer to you when you touch her forearm, go for it!
By touching her forearm first, you are giving her a subtle heads up that you’re thinking about trying something a little more intimate.She will probably appreciate this gesture, regardless of whether or not she wants you to put your arm around her. It's usually preferable to be anticipating it rather than being totally blind-sided.

, It may sound like a no-brainer, but before you go for it, take a quick look to confirm you can put your arm around her easily and smoothly. If you aren’t close enough to pull the move off smoothly, the gesture will probably come off as very awkward for both of you.


When you finally do put your arm around her, you will want it to seem effortless and comfortable.
If getting your arm around her seems like a stretch because of distance, move a little closer to her and see how she reacts.

Develop a mutual sense of trust.Just as with any other relationship, trust is one of the most important things you can have with a soulmate.,
Decide for yourself what a soulmate means to you.,
Reflect on your past relationship experience.,

Consider the possibility of past lives and flashbacks.",How to Recognise Your Soulmate," In general, people who place a high value and confidence in themselves are able to give more of themselves to other people.This includes tending to mind and body, as well as your lifestyle, before trying to find someone to share it with.


Taking care of your body will make you feel more like yourself. Improving your appearance will also make you more physically attractive, making it easier to attract someone.Shifting your expectations towards others is an important part of improving yourself. Make sure your expectations of another person are realistic before you try looking for someone. It won't get you anywhere if you're being demanding.;
, You can't expect to find a soulmate if you're cloistered away. Although it's never recommended that you go out purely for the sake of finding a lifelong partner, your chances of meeting someone special are vastly higher if you make an effort to get out of the house and into the social scene. Get out with friends, and try to explore areas and situations you're not used to. The more you get out of your comfort zone, the more possibilities you'll be exposed to.


First impressions mean a lot, but they don't mean everything. If you get a bad first impression from somebody, that doesn't necessarily mean the two of you will have bad chemistry once you get to know each other., Interests say a lot about someone. A great deal of someone's time and experience of life will be based around their interests, and motivated by their values. Finding a soulmate can also mean finding someone whose values are a close match to your own. Finding out about someone's interests can be done through casual conversation. Looking for someone with similar hobbies can help you find a soulmate much faster.


You can increase your chances of finding a soulmate if you frequent places that relate to your interests. For instance, if you love music, you should make a habit of going to as many shows as possible. You'll meet lots of interesting people that way, and the mere fact that the two of you are in the same place together means you know you have at least one interest in common.
Don't be afraid to try out someone with completely different interests. There may be a great chemistry regardless, and you'll almost always find common ground with another person.
Some couples manage to make it work if they have different religious affiliations. However, having opposing views about the meaning of the universe can make it difficult to feel a total closeness., While it's often romanticized that you will click with your soulmate at first sight, things aren't usually that easy. To know whether you have chemistry with someone, you need to have a real talk where the two of you have the chance to open up. In some cases, you may have met a potential soulmate in passing but never had a chance to unlock the potential there. Keep an open mind when you're meeting new people. You never know who you might hit it off with.


If you're finding it hard to open up to someone, chances are she's not your soulmate. The same goes both ways; if the other person seems to resist, it's unlikely that she's your soulmate.

, No one is ever going to be a truly perfect fit for you in life. Don't get too perfectionistic with looking for a soulmate. All human relationships are imperfect by design.If you find someone who makes it feel amazing to be alive, that should be enough. Any minor flaws should be taken and embraced along with the rest of the package. Major flaws should be approached with caution. If you notice glaring issues with someone, you should think twice before trying to get closer to her.


Major flaws would count as something that would keep you from feeling satisfied with this person for the rest of your life. On the other hand, minor flaws may be irritating, but they're often seen as negligible compared to a person's positive aspects.

, This means you need to be okay with being yourself if you want that sort of connection with somebody. If you hide a part of yourself away from the other person, you'll never know if the two of you have that full chemistry.


This idea obviously goes both ways. The other person needs to be completely open with you.

, One of the truest things about having a soulmate is the ability to talk to each other without any fear of judgement or censorship.Even in otherwise healthy relationships, couples tend to get into the bad habit of keeping things from one another. Even if this is intended to save the other person's feelings, that's not something you should feel you need to be doing with a soulmate.

, It can be a rare thing to feel completely at home in the presence of someone else. Considering how uncommon this is, a sense of safety like that could be a sign you are in the presence of a soulmate.

, Even if you have a soulmate-worthy chemistry with someone, all of that can be destroyed through breaking trust. If you think this person is 'the one', you should be trying all that much harder to stay true and loyal to them.


Even with the strongest chemistry, it can take a long time to really build up mutual trust, especially if you've had bad luck with being vulnerable in the past. Developing trust with someone after bad experiences ultimately takes a conscious decision to go out on a limb and willingly make yourself vulnerable before that person. It's not an easy thing to do for some people, but if the person in question is truly your soulmate, you'll benefit greatly from the intimacy and connection.

, If you're looking for your soulmate, it's important to address the fact that the definition can vary from person to person. While some people may see a soulmate as a real, spiritual connection, most simply use the term to describe someone they have a close chemistry with.In thinking this way, it's also important to recognize that there is no 'one' person out there for you. You may end up in a happy, lifelong partnership with someone special, but you could well have ended up with a number of others that could have made you just as happy.


Take some time to think about it before moving ahead with finding someone. It's important not to be a perfectionist when it comes to relationships. Nothing's going to be perfect.

, If you want to recognize your soulmate when you see her, it's often a good idea to look at experiences you've already had for guidance. If you have a dating history, you may be able to identify patterns, both in yourself and the type of people you usually attract. You may find issues in yourself that have made it difficult to fully give yourself over to someone.If you need clarity in recognizing your soulmate, try asking yourself some of these questions:


""Where and how did I meet people I became romantically involved with?""
""What was good about my past relationships? What was bad?""
""Was there anything I did that may have sabotaged the relationship?""
""Were the people I've dated in the past the kind I wanted to begin with?""
""Why did my past relationships end?""

, Some people who like to think about soulmates and fate think star signs have something to do with it.Although it is pseudo-science and should only be taken with a grain of salt, it can be interesting to look at your star signs and see if your signs are typically seen as compatible or not.


Star signs are determined by the time of the year you were born in.

, If you want to take a spiritual approach to soulmates, you should think about the idea of past lives. If you have a spiritual soulmate, chances are the two of you have spent time together in other cycles of reincarnation.This can appear as a sense of deja-vu.

Go on a Friday or Saturday night.,
Pick a romantic or scary movie.,
Make sure the seating will accommodate your move.,
Choose the right moment.,
Be calm and casual.",How to Put Your Arm Around a Girl2," Most dates happen at night, so opt for an evening showing over a matinee. Furthermore, choose a Friday or Saturday night to go see the movie, since those evenings are considered by most to be date nights. You want to communicate to her that you definitely consider this to be a date.If she agrees to go to a movie on a Friday or Saturday night with you, it’s a good sign that she definitely likes you as more than a friend.
Her presence alone should boost your courage!

, Either one of these types of movies will create an atmosphere conducive to putting your arm around a girl. On the other hand, a raunchy comedy or documentary might not create the most romantic atmosphere.


Scary movies in particular work well because when people go through frightening things together, even if it’s just a movie and not “real,” it creates a feeling of closeness.Make sure she likes horror movies before you bring her to one. You want the experience to be fun for her, not literally terrifying.

, Once the two of you sit down in the theater, check out the seating situation. Are the seats close enough together? Are they comfortable? If you shift your weight around, do the seats make any weird or awkward sounds? Is there an armrest between your seats and, if so, will it get in your way? These are all things to consider.


If any of the above-mentioned scenarios seem like they might get in your way or create an awkward moment, wait for a better time.
If your shoulders are touching when you sit in your seats, you’ll be able to pull the move off seamlessly.

, The best time to make your move is during a romantic scene or a scary scene during which she might appreciate a little comfort. Avoid trying to put your arm around her a during sex scene, since that could be very awkward and send her the wrong message.


Another bad time to try is during a pivotal scene or a climactic one, since your move might be more of a distraction to her than a romantic gesture if she’s engrossed in the film.

, You will probably be feeling pretty nervous, but try not to show it. If you are visibly stressed out, your date will probably start feeling the same way, which is not an ideal situation for this. Try to breathe slowly and evenly and keep your demeanor calm. Mentally remind yourself to relax every now and then, if you need to.


Avoid fidgeting, which communicates that you’re anxious.To pull this off smoothly, you should also try to make the move feel spontaneous to her (even if you planned every detail).
If it feels planned out and forced when you put your arm around her, she’ll notice and it will probably create an awkward, uncomfortable atmosphere.

Go for a walk together.,
Be near her.,
Offer her your jacket.,
Use the classic stretch and yawn move.",How to Put Your Arm Around a Girl3," When you’re out for a walk, it’s a chance to spend a moment alone together. It’s also a natural time to have a meaningful or sweet discussion with her and, since you’ll already be walking side by side, it’s a perfect scenario for you to put your arm around her.


Avoid discussing anything heavy or negative. Walk slowly and keep your body language relaxed.Suggest taking a stroll with her at a nearby park on a pretty afternoon.
Another good excuse for a walk is to go window shopping or run an errand.

, Wherever you happen to be hanging out or whatever you might be doing, always try to sit or stand close to her when it makes sense to do so. Obviously, don’t follow her into the bathroom or anything like that, but in general, staying by her side creates a “couple” atmosphere and provides ample opportunities to get your arm around her.


If she seems uncomfortable with your nearness or makes excuses to get away, give it a rest. You want her to feel liked, not stalked.

, If she looks cold or if you happen to be out together on a windy or overcast day, be a gentleman and offer her your jacket. Not only will she think you’re romantic, but putting your jacket over her shoulders provides an excellent opportunity to sneak your arm around her.


Place the jacket sweetly around her shoulders, and then let your arm remain naturally around them.
Smile at her and give her shoulder a little squeeze after you’re got your arm around her.
She’ll most likely look up at you when you do this, and you two will share a real moment of closeness.

, If all else fails, give this classic a try! Yawn a bit and naturally lift your arms up in a stretch, being as casual as you can. When you bring your arms down, put one of them around her shoulders. If this feels a little obvious, you can always overact the move in a very obvious, cheesy way.


This will probably make her laugh, and you should too!
Sharing a laugh will break the ice and create a sense of comfort and ease between the two of you, and you’ll have your arm snugly around her.

With this in mind, make a plan to make your sex life as safe as possible. If you can, before you have sex, get to know your partner, and talk openly about your sexual histories. Use a condom or dental dam every time you have sex, and for the complete act.Only latex and polyurethane condoms protect against STIs and HIV. Polyurethane condoms may break more easily than latex. Use a condom any time you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.A dental dam is a latex barrier that you can use when performing oral sex with a female partner. It can help prevent the spread of STIs and HIV. You can also cut open a condom and use it as a barrier.Women should also consider getting the HPV vaccine to help prevent problems like genital warts and cervical cancer.HPV vaccines may cause fainting or allergic reactions in some people, so talk with your doctor about whether the vaccine is right for you.;
, Feeling self-conscious or embarrassed of your body can make sex needlessly uncomfortable. If you struggle with body image issues that are negatively affecting your sex life, then make it a priority to rectify what you can and accept what you cannot. Accepting your body is key to a happy self and the first step to better sex life.


Try looking at yourself in the mirror and make it a point to find a new positive about yourself each day.You can also make it a point to get to know your own body in a sexual way. Women who masturbate have significantly more sexual satisfaction than those who do not Knowing what feels good for yourself will help you communicate your needs to your partner.

, Communication with your partner will improve your sexual satisfaction and help with your intimacy.It can be hard to establish and maintain open communication with your partner, especially if you aren't comfortable with sex and what you want. Think about what you can say and still feel comfortable and safe.


No matter how well you think you may know each other, your partner isn't a mind reader. If there is something you want to change about your sex life, then it's important to talk about it. If your partner is really committed to you, then he or she will be willing to listen and respect your needs.Communicating your sexual needs can even be a good bonding experience for you and your partner., You need to be open with your partner about your attitudes and feelings toward sex. You should also make a point of asking your partner what s/he wants and what s/he likes. Being shy or coy will only make your partner feel self conscious, which can make the experience worse for both of you. Let yourself enjoy the experience and allow yourself to let your partner see that you're enjoying it too.Don't judge your partner for what he or she likes. It can be scary for both of you to divulge that kind of information, so listen to them without interrupting. If your partner likes something that you are not comfortable with, let them know that you are not interested in it without making him or her feel weird or bad about his or her desires.Avoid using euphemisms when possible. These are not clear, and can make it harder for your partner to understand you. Use language that you're comfortable with, but remember that sex is not ""wrong"" or ""dirty,"" and using terminology that is clear and communicative is helpful., There are times when something you try in the bedroom isn't working. Instead of placing the blame on anyone, use ""I"" statements to express what is unsatisfying about the experience for you. If you are more honest about the things you don't like, you can fix them. This can only make the sex better.


For example, tell your partner, ""I feel as if the sex is too rushed. What can we do to fix this?"" This statement communicates the problem you are having with the sex but doesn't place the blame on anyone. Instead, it shows that it is something that you can work on together.Frame things positively when possible, such as ""I really enjoy when you do ____ and would like that to happen more often"" or ""Such-and-such really works better for me than so-and-so -- can we try that instead?"", See his or her pleasure as your goal line. Of course, it's important for you to get what you're looking for from a sexual relationship too, but you should start by setting a good example. The better you make him or her feel, the more he or she going to want to rise to the challenge. The key to good sex is to make sure that you're processing and acknowledging your partner's reactions to the experience.


When you see your partner wince, stop. You might be hurting him or her. When you hear your partner moan, repeat the motion you just did because it probably feels really good. Most importantly, pay attention throughout sex to make sure that your partner is mutually interested in everything you are doing.
Stop immediately if he or she says “no.”
Remember that just because your partner doesn't say ""no"" doesn't mean that he or she is comfortable with the situation. Consent is an on-going process. After all, your goal is to get a resounding “yes!” from the both of you.

, Porn is like all other movies: they do not reflect reality. Porn is shot and set up to look good on camera, but it usually doesn't reflect what actually feels good or what a real sexual encounter looks like.


Try to go in with no expectations. Just let things go naturally., You want to enjoy every minute of the entire experience. It shouldn't be a ""get-in-get-out"" operation. Enjoy the whole sexual experience. Pay attention to your partner's erogenous zones and spend time pleasuring them. Slow down and explore your partner's whole body. Don't just go for the cliche parts.


You can also play games with one another to liven up the experience. Always focus on connection and keeping them guessing to make the sex interesting.
Make a point to keep kissing. Returning for a sexy make-out every now and again can be a great way to draw out the experience.

, Before jumping right to the main event, spend some time kissing, caressing, and pleasing one another. Foreplay can make sex last longer and feel more sensual and romantic. Women especially find that foreplay is helpful in getting them in the right mood, whereas men may be more ready to go at any moment.


It's in your best interest to get your lady in the mood. It will increase her natural lubrication and make her enjoy sex more., You should make sure that your partner never doubts for a moment that you think he or she is pretty much the hottest thing on the planet, maybe even the hottest thing for the next couple planets. When you see something you like, let your partner know.


You don't always have to say it, but take time to enjoy it. Let your partner see you enjoying his or her body too.

, Personal lubrication products can significantly improve sexual satisfaction.Using quality lubricants is very important to good sex, especially if your partner is a woman or if you are having anal sex. Sexual interactions involve a lot of friction and, most of the time, friction is a good. However, it also has its downsides, such as chafing and discomfort. You can buy lubricants at many local stores and pharmacies as well as online. You can also get them through your doctor or a sexual health clinic.Choose lubricant products without the ingredient glycerin, which leads to vaginal dryness. Avoid using scented products or other materials that could cause vaginal dryness, including douches, hand lotions, soaps, or bath oils. To use lubricants correctly, follow manufacturer's instructions.There are three types of lubrication, water-based, silicone-based, and oil-based. Water-based lubricants rinse off easily, and are easy to find in stores. They can also be used with condoms, can prevent the condom from breaking,, and produce fewer genital symptoms than silicone-based lubricants.Silicone-based lubricants last longer than other lubricants and are the best choice for anal sex.Oil-based lubricants should never be used with latex condoms because they can cause the condom to break. , When you are having sex, try to make some noises of appreciation for your partner. Of course, you don't want to go over the top, but making some basic moans and gasps lets your partner know not only when something feels good and when your partner should do more of it, it also tells that you're enjoying the experience. This will heighten his or her enjoyment and also encourage your partner to put in more effort.


A recent study reveals that partners who make noise during sex tend to have better sex. So just do what feels natural and if you feel like making noise, let it loose., You don't need to go full blown over the top with the things you like in bed, but some basic kink can really add variety and interest to your sex life. The problem is that sex can easily become routine, especially when you've been with someone for awhile. To keep it great or make it better, you want to break up the monotony.

Aim to have moisturized lips all the time, instead of putting on lip balm just before you kiss. It can create a strange taste and sticky texture on your lips.
If your lips are regularly chapped, use a sugar and olive oil lip scrub 3 times per week. Rinse and apply petroleum jelly once you have exfoliated. ;
, If you are just beginning a relationship, increase the number of times you brush to 3 per day, instead of 2. If you have a spontaneous kiss, you will want to feel confident in your breath.


Kissing evolved as a way to gauge your partner’s health. Make sure you are sending the right biological signals. , Even if you just met the person you want to kiss a few hours ago, flirty will make your make out session even better.


Say encouraging things if you want him to think of you as a potential love interest. Try “It sounds like we have a lot in common” or “we have similar tastes.”
Say “Let’s go somewhere less noisy/more private,” if you want to get him alone.

If so, you can incorporate gentle nipping throughout the kissing session. , If you want to keep the session contained to just kissing, you should move your hands over his chest, back, waist, neck and hair.


Some men don’t like it when women grab their hair and others love it. Pay attention so that you can improve the kiss.

, If he has you pinned against a wall or bed, pin him in turn. You can show some playful dominance with this gesture. If you are standing, try sitting or laying down.

, If you have been kissing for 5 minutes, pull away and pay attention to these sensitive areas before starting another kiss.

, Take a moment to decide if this will be only a make out session or something more. Increase the anticipation by leaving him wanting more.

Realize that women think differently.,
Figure out her attachment style.,
Compliment her.,
Win over her friends.,
Realize her brain goes in tangents.",How to Make Her Love You1," We all know this. But to make a woman love you, you need to understand how women process information. It's probably different than you do.


There is a reason women like to talk. Women's brains are wired to be more verbal. Girls learn to speak earlier and are good at learning foreign languages, research has found. Although you don't need to fill every second with words, just be aware that women like it when men process feelings through words. Try to be a good conversationalist - especially if she's angry. When men shut down during arguments and go silent, it drives women crazy. Write her a love note. Remember, women love communication and words. Become the master of the text message.
If she asks you about your day, don't just say it was fine. If she asks you how she looks in that new dress, don't just say she looks fine. Give her some details and back up your answer, and she will feel close to you.;
, Women have different attachment styles. Understanding hers will help you appeal to her.


Secure. A woman with a secure attachment style is confident, and she isn't going to be too clingy (or want you to be). She won't be calling repeatedly or waiting outside your apartment for you to get home. Ideally, this is the kind of attachment style you want a woman to have. If this is your woman, you should show her that you're secure also. She won't have much tolerance for insecurity.
Anxious. Women with anxious attachment styles are insecure and likely to want a relationship to proceed very fast. They need a lot of reassurance, so give it to them.
Dismissive. This kind of woman will fight her attraction to you because she prides herself in her independence and feels smothered by a relationship. You will have to be persistent and make sure you also give her space.
Fearful. Women with fearful attachment styles are those who have gone through some kind of relationship trauma. You should go slow and demonstrate that you understand what she has been through. , Women like to feel unique, and the female brain responds positively to flattery. Women can never get enough compliments.


Tell her she has pretty eyes. If you pull out a single trait, it tells her you really mean it.
Compliment her intellect. Women are used to their looks being talked about, but she also wants to feel valued for her mind. This will tell her you aren't just interested in her physically.
Always tell her she looks good in an outfit, even if she looks awful. It's just not worth it.

, If their friends like a guy, a woman is more likely to think he's something special too.


Never, ever flirt with her friends. It will get you banished. Let her friends know how much you like her. They are probably protective of her and wary that she could get hurt. If you reassure them that you really are into her, they will like you more (and probably tell her besides).

, Men tend to focus on one task at a time, but women's brains are wired to think about many things at once. She will get annoyed if she wants to talk about one thing, but you're still focused on another. An example of this would be if you are watching a basketball game, and she brings up another topic. If you ignore her or say little back, she will be frustrated. Women speak in ""hint"" language. They will often ask questions that are really nudges for you to get a point. Learn how to perceive what a woman is hinting. For example, if she says, ""It's cold in here, don't you think?"" she probably wants you to turn the thermostat up for her, not just answer ""yes.""
Women are intuitive thinkers, so if you compliment her intuition, she will appreciate it. They also like to over analyze relationships. Indulge her in this."
"
Don't chase her too much.,
Avoid the friend zone.,
Touch her.,
Be sentimental.,
Take care of her.,
Show confidence, and really feel it.",How to Make Her Love You2," It's a cliche, but it's true. People like to be the hunter, not the hunted. If you chase a woman too soon and too fast, she may think you are desperate and less of a catch. So, let her know you're interested - but not too much, at least at first.


Don't show too much immediate attraction. If you don't know for sure that she likes you, you do not want to scare her away by confessing your ""love."" End the date first. End texting first. End phone conversations first. Don't overdo this one, though. You also need to give her some encouragement or she might give up or get too insecure. Just don't always chase. For example, you should let her be the person to ask whether the relationship is exclusive.
If you are unpredictable, this will give you more control in the dynamic. For example, sometimes don't respond for three days. Then, respond right away. Most people actually find mixed signals alluring.
Don't drop every commitment to be with her. Women are attracted to men who have other things going on in their lives, like careers. Similarly, have a hobby. If she sees you have a passion outside of her, she will find you interesting and exciting. But don't always put other things ahead of her either. As with everything, it's all about balance. , If you find yourself squarely in the friend zone, you are probably going to end up stuck there forever. At least, it's more likely. Women tend to divide romantic interests into two categories: People they would date. People they only see as friends.


Not always being available will also help you stay out of the friend zone. Don't be too comedic, goofy, or self-deprecating. If you act like the class clown, there is a better chance she will friend zone you. Absolutely refuse to listen to her talk about another guy she likes. That will put you in the friend zone for sure. Tell her you like her yourself, so you can't be the shoulder to cry on.
Don't go too long before making a move. If you wait weeks to kiss her, she might think you only see her as a friend.

, Show her your lovable side. Hug her, tell her how you really feel sometimes, and so on. No girl can deny a guy who opens up to her and tells her how he truly feels if you're sweet about it.


Cuddling with her a lot has an extra benefit. Research shows that cuddling (and sex) release a chemical called Oxytocin into women's bodies. This chemical helps break down emotional barriers and creates a feeling of attachment in women because it is associated with pleasure. Show emotion in bed. It's important to women that you don't make them feel you're just interested in them sexually. But don't be afraid to take charge and show her a great time! Hold her after the act is done. Stroke her hair and face.
Offer her your jacket if it's cold outside. Hold her hand when you're walking. Women love these kinds of lovable actions. , Women love to feel special and unique, above all others. So if you show a sentimental streak, she will love it, as long as you don't overdo it.


Put a photo of her somewhere she will find it. Women like to know you think they're special. They also might look through your things at some point. This is wrong, but it happens.
You could put a photo of her in your wallet or use it as your screen saver on your cell phone. When she sees it, she will be flattered (as long as it's not too soon in the relationship. Wait until you're exclusive).
Put a photo of her by your bed on your nightstand. This will make her feel more confident that you aren't cheating.
Mention a specific song that was playing when you met or around the time you met, and tell her that it's your song together. Then, give her a CD with it for a gift.
Speak a lot about the details of when your relationship began. These will be positive details, and it will matter to her that you remember them. Don't forget anniversaries, how you met, the first conversation you had, and so on.

, Although women may have their own career and value their independence, there is a little piece, at least, inside most of them that appreciates a protector. Again, everything must be done in balance. You don't want to become excessively controlling.


Create a scenario where she realizes you're the one she can rely on. If her car breaks down, be there for her. If she can't fix something, offer to come over and do it. Be the guy she depends on.
Open doors, including car doors. Women love a gallant streak. Respect her. Your attitude and your actions should demonstrate to her that you have nothing but the utmost of respect for her. Don't be more than 30 minutes late. It shows her that you're indifferent to her.
If she's staying out of town at a hotel, prepare for room service or a bottle of wine to be sent to her room or order flowers.
If you live together or are married, do some of the housekeeping to give her a break. If you are single and don't live together, do your own housekeeping. If your apartment is a complete pig sty, she will know that's what she has to look forward to down the road.

, If you are a mess, it's going to be harder to get her to fall in love with you. Women (and men) are attracted to confidence.


If you hate your job, change it. If you hate your weight, lose it. If you hate yourself, seek counseling. You need to be centered in who you are - and happy about it - to attract a secure person.
It's really true that you need self-love to be loved. If you don't feel confident, fake it. People will perceive you are confident, they will react more positively to you, and then you will feel more confident. See how easy that is?!
Don't mistake arrogance for confidence. Talk about her, not yourself. Ask her questions about her job, her day, and her family. Don't just bombard her endlessly with conversation about yourself or your interests.
Although you should not chase her too hard in the beginning of a relationship, you should make the first move. Men who make the first move are perceived as confident by women. "

Don't give up all the power.,
Don't talk about exes.,
Treat others well.,
Don't be unfaithful.",How to Make Her Love You3," This doesn't mean you should become a scary control freak. It's a balance. But if you give up all of the power, she will be less likely to respect you.


When taking her out - as friends or if you've worked up the nerve to ask her out on an official date - take the lead. Choose the place, offer to pay for the meal, but be sure it's all within reason. Choose some place you know that you will both have fun (if you're trying to earn her love, you'd probably get brownie points for going to someplace you know that she likes, even if it means a little suffering on your behalf).
Don't be available every time she asks.
Don't be jealous. You talk to other people. There's no bigger turn off to a girl than the guy she's interested in becoming all clingy and controlling. A little jealousy is cute, but don't overdue it with questions such as ""Who was that? Are you into him? How do you know him?""
Never, ever beg. If she says she doesn't want to date you, she's not going to want to date you more if you plead. Instead, act disinterested. It will increase the chances she will change her mind.

, Women can't stand it when a guy talks about a past girlfriend too much because they want to feel unique. So avoid it at all costs.


If she asks you about why you broke up with a past girlfriend, just say ""because she wasn't you."" Women will over-analyze detailed answers, so don't go there. And definitely don't bring up exes on your own.
If you run into the ex, make sure to introduce your girlfriend and move on quickly.

, Women notice when a man doesn't treat other people well. They are likely to be turned off by displays of obnoxiousness.


Talk kindly to your server at restaurants, and leave a decent tip.
Never let her see you angry (unless it's about someone who has mistreated her). Woman are frightened by male anger (so resist the road rage and don't get in a fight in the bar.)
Speak respectfully of your parents and all past relationships. Even if your past relationship was a nightmare, don't go into a negative rant about it. Don't talk about it a lot, but don't talk negatively about past exes when the subject does come up.

, For many women, being unfaithful is a deal-breaker. And women may define faithfulness as emotional cheating, not just physical.


Don't flirt with other women when you are around her, and don't talk too much about other women, including people at work, or she will get suspicious.
Watch conversations on social media and texting. Always consider how she would react if she had access to your phone or computer. For that matter, let her have your passwords or see your phone if she asks. There's nothing bad on it, right?
Don't cheat and lie about it. Just don't be unfaithful, period. If you can't be faithful to her, you can hardly expect her to love you.

, Guys love being problem-solvers. Asking him for his advice makes him feel useful and as if you value his opinion.You don’t have to take his suggestions, but being open to hearing them is an important part of making him feel needed.


Talk to him about an issue with a coworker you’re having at work or a deadline that you’re having trouble meeting. Nod and say, “That sounds like a good idea” or “You make a great point”. Decide whether or not you want to use his advice and let him know how things went if you did.

, Eyes say so much and act as windows to the soul, including what you desire. By looking at him like you could devour him at any moment, you relay to him how hot he makes you and make him feel sexier and hotter in the process. Not being able to take your eyes off of each other and/or not being able to take your eyes off of him will make him feel desired and irresistible to you. Mutual anticipation revs up along with your desire for him.
Avoiding eye contact may send a message that you’re not that interested. So even if eye contact makes you a little shy, try to meet his gaze every once and a while for at least a few seconds.

, Truly enjoying him in all capacities is physical support to the fact that you desire him.


Men rarely receive physical touches other than handshakes or hugs so physical contact from the opposite sex feels electrifying and instantly makes him think about sex.Playfully slap his arm or shoulder, rub his back, or cut to the chase and give him a full blown kiss.
Touch him wherever you want to and as often as you feel like touching him. It’s an instant attention getter and lets him know that you want him as much as he wants you, whether you’re in public or alone.

Your natural scent is more of a turn-on than sweet-smelling fragrances that overpower your scent.The role that your natural body odor plays in attraction and arousal shouldn’t be overlooked, so skip the scented body lotions and perfumes.

, Allow your fingers to linger at his mouth once he’s taken his bite. Retain eye contact as you do and have him feed you too. It’s a very sensual act that will fuel the heat between you two., Allow yourself to have an audible response to what he does to your body physically.

Use eye contact to flirt with your love interest to get him or her interested.Try gazing into the person’s eyes for a few minutes and then slowly turn your gaze elsewhere.

, Mirroring body position can also indicate your interest in a person and provide opportunities for him or her to do the same.

In a relationship with others, remember it is not about what you get, it is about what you give.",How to Make a Women Feel Validated," If you are not supportive on even the most trivial issues, they will spin out and not feel validated. How to be supportive? Listen, Listen, and Listen. Do mirror listening. Don't text while they are giving you their undivided attention. Don't surf the computer.;
, A passionate kiss. The kind that is firm, french, with a snuggle hug like you won't see her for a long time.

, At least 3-5 times a day. This is only going to help make her feel loved. If you don't, she thinks you don't even care or that you aren't thinking about her. Do it even if you have to set 3 alarms on your iPhone and send them at the same time everyday, do it!

, ""What feels good to you?"" This helps her know that you care about how she feels.

, You must fill your minds with light. This will help you to have common goals. If she likes girlie mags, ask her which article she wants read while she is doing her makeup in the morning. Could be fun if the article is about love.

, Her hair! Her fashion! Her sweet comments to strangers! Her cooking! (Even if you hate it! Do it!) Her thoughtful several calls that you can't stand. Pick up the phone and tell her that you love her but that you are buried but that you didn't want to miss hearing her sweet voice and wanted to make sure there wasn't anything urgent.

, Tell her you love watching her smile and her laugh!

, If you want to stay together long term you have to have a spiritual foundation.

, This is the best way to contact her.

, She was made by them.

, Some women need certain friends. If you come down on one of her closest friends, it could drive a wedge between you and your sweetie.

, If you feel like it initiate it! If you have to ask then the answer is no! Because you aren't feeling it either. No one likes to feel pressure to perform. If you initiate it, it will happen naturally.

, Chances are she is already hard enough on herself and those negative comments are going to come back to haunt you in some way.

, Do it! Not asking for anything in return!

, When Men express anger with Men, they generally don't get intimidated. When Men express anger or unhappiness with Women, they can get super intimidated with our basic authority and they feel like we are bullying. This is often not the intention. No Name calling! No saying your acting crazy! A women hears, ""You are a crazy *****"" Say something like, ""I feel like .......when you are expressing yourself like this. Say, ""Honey, I sense you are having a tough time, Will you please share your thoughts or feelings with me?"" The reason why she could be freaking out may have nothing to do with what she is presenting. It's like having an electrical issue on a car and you can't find the source, so you jump the fuse box with metal and the wire fries completely at the spot that it is grounded out. You don't want to do that because it is a pain to rewire the problem. When you feel the pressure build, go take a break before you say something you will regret.

, Don't call your buddies and ask for advice. They don't have a clue. And chances are they will say just dump her, she's crazy. Well ya know what, they are all the same in varying shades of grey. Work with what you have got instead of trying to change nature.

, Like Harmony! Or Like Sunshine! Like Your first date location...What ever your word. Means either of you have had enough arguing about the current topic. And that you are feeling attacked. This word should remind you of why you are together. Stop the damage by sharing one thing that you love about each other. Focus on happiness vs fighting. No one likes to feel bad. So if they say the magical word. Think, she is crashing or he is crashing. Pressure is going to make it worse. Tell her you love her and work on recovering her emotions. This is were her foundation is. Not in the core of the comfort that we enjoy by knowing she is there and that we are committed. It is the opposite. They feel the relationship is on the rocks if emotionally they are threatened.

, Don't keep track. You should always feel like to give is the blessing.

, Some research has shown that people may be more likely to find others desirable if they have to work harder to spend time with them. Try spending some good quality time with your love interest while you are just getting to know each other, then make yourself unavailable for a few days.

Some coupons will be the size of a matchbox, others the size of a smart phone, and some the size of a check.;
, If all of the templates online are a bit too basic for your taste, you can always make your own. Making and printing a template on a computer can save time. You can then easily fill each coupon out with it’s own text, either on the computer or by hand. Look at templates available online for ideas.Many different applications can be used to make a simple template. For instance, Google Docs and other words processors can do the job. Many of these are also freely available.
While the design is entirely up to you, decide on a standard shape, and be sure to include things like, “Coupon: _________________”, “Expiration Date:_____________” and “Validated by: ___________.”

, Coupons that are printed on a sheet of colored or patterned paper may look especially good. More importantly, however, use a sheet of paper that is a bit thicker than regular paper, such as cardstock or paper meant for formal correspondence. Thicker paper will hold up much better, even in your partner's wallet or purse.


You can get thick paper from an office supply store or online.
Make sure your printer can handle whatever sort of paper you’re hoping to print on, or have the coupons printed at a print store.

Use construction paper or something even thicker, and start by cutting out as many coupons as you’ll need in the same shape.

Perhaps the easiest way to fasten the coupons is by stapling them all together at one end. You can glue something over or around the staples to obscure them.
Another option is using scissors with patterns teeth to cut the ends of each coupon and make them look like big carnival tickets. Then they can simply be tied or rubber-banded all together.

Listen to her and try your best to comfort her when upset.,
Do not compare her with your ex-girlfriend.",How to Love Your Girlfriend1," You experience many benefits from gratitude, like bettering your physical and mental health. But you might not know that gratitude also reduces aggression and strengthens empathy.Your partner will likely interpret as an expression of love.;
, Men have a tendency to keep thoughts to themselves and to build relationships while working on tasks, which can be interpreted as coldness. Even if you don't agree with what is being said, acknowledge it and respond appropriately.

, A text, phone call, or email might be the easiest way of getting in touch with your girlfriend, but taking the time to pen a letter yourself and either mail it or deliver it shows your girlfriend she's worth the time to do something nice., Use your own words to come up with a unique message that conveys just how much you love your girlfriend. Vocalizing your feelings can help you manage and enrich those feelings.Try starting with:


""It's hard for me to say sometimes because I feel it so strongly, but I love you more than anything.""
""There is nothing better than having you in my arms.""
""Whenever I see you, I...""

, Negative surprises have a measurable effect on satisfaction. Prevent negative surprises for your girlfriend to maintain a higher level of satisfaction.Conversely, positive surprises will give your girlfriend a higher sense of satisfaction.

, If your girlfriend articulates a need to continue a conversation even if it is unpleasant for you, take note of her emotional need. In the event that you are unable to calmly carry out the conversation, voice your own feelings while acknowledging her own., It can be easy to take for granted something you know absolutely to be true, like your love for your girlfriend. Reawaken yourself to this truth by reminding her frequently.Look her in the eyes, or wait for an unexpected moment, like when the lights dim before a movie plays in the theater, and whisper, ""I love you.""

, The very act of asking this question to your girlfriend will signal to her that her happiness is important to you. Showing you care for her emotional well-being is a powerful indicator of love.You might ask:


""What are your guilty pleasures?"" This can be useful down the road when she's unhappy or when you want to give her a small surprise.
""If you could ... in the world, what would you...?"" This pattern is great for making future plans. You can kill an afternoon talking about exotic places or things you've always wanted to eat, then use this later when planning a trip or gift.

, Talk to her and sincerely ask her how she feels. Women frequently communicate by sharing personal details and feelings of vulnerability.Respond in kind to communicate your own feelings more clearly to her.


Remove, ""What's up?"" from your vocabulary. Ask direct questions, ""How was your morning? What did you have for lunch? Was it good?"" Respond to her answer with your own opinions and observations.

, Even if you don't know what to tell her, a hug or a shoulder to cry on can be enough. Though being around an emotional person can be difficult, by staying with your girlfriend through the ordeal, you demonstrate your dependability. It's important to let her know that:


""Everything's going to be OK.""
""Sometimes I feel the same way.""
""I'm here for you.""

, Comparisons are a natural part of human communication, but by comparing your girlfriend to your ex you may accidentally make her feel like she's in competition with a previous girlfriend.


Research has shown that closeness and affection in a relationship are influenced when you make comparisons to a prior partner."

Consider whether the person is worth your love or not.,
Open yourself to the possibility of being hurt.With all love comes the risk of potentially having those feelings turned against you.,

Distinguish love from infatuation.It is very easy to recognize mere attraction as real love.,
Be realistic about love.,
Ask yourself if you have loved before.",How to Love Someone," Love requires a significant emotional investment. While loving someone is not always a matter of choice, it may be worth taking a look at the connection you have with a given person and thinking how loving them might affect you. While this step may sound like a warning, it's actually a positive step towards loving them. If you struggle with feeling love, justifying it on a logical basis can be a positive step forward.


Refusing to be realistic about your feelings may be a sign of infatuation, so be warned.;
, Defence mechanisms may arise as a way to protect us from the possibility of loving someone. In order to love fully, you need to push past this doubt and realize that love is worth all of the risks you take in pursuing it.


Positive self-talk is a good way to get past this fear. If you are ever in doubt, don't be afraid to tell yourself aloud: ""Love is worth the risk of being hurt."" Living in fear is itself a form of pain. If you're able to train yourself to let go of that, you'll be much better for the long run., You have probably heard the metaphor comparing love to a drug, but as far as brain chemistry goes, that is somewhat true.When you love someone, you become addicted to their presence. If you focus on all of the good things about someone, you will become increasingly excited to see them again.


Love as an addiction should manifest itself as missing that person terribly while you're apart., This is not so often the case with love. If you truly love someone, you feel happy for their happiness, and don't let your own jealousies into the mix.

, Though your feelings towards yourself may have nothing to do with the way your perceive someone you love, the fact remains that you cannot give yourself completely over to someone unless you feel secure and stable with who you are. Loving yourself means recognizing your good qualities, and acknowledging that those are the things that define you as a person.The experience of loving yourself isn't comparable to love for another, but it is a strong step in the right direction.

, Arguably the most obvious way of showing love is through words of affirmation.This can range from anything from a simple ""I love you"" to a more elaborate passage about all the things you admire about the person you love. This applies to love in friendships as much as romantic arrangements.


Often, saying ""I love you"" says more than most anything else, if only for the fact that people have placed so much emphasis on those three words.

, Touch can be used to a wide variety of positive effects.While the benefits would seem most apparent in a romantic connection, love may be demonstrated in all types of love. Depending on the type of connection you have with someone you love, physical affection may come naturally, and it may be reciprocated in turn. Physical touch feels good, and helps promote good feelings between the both of you.Kissing and cuddling are best suited to show romantic love.
A handshake or a hug can demonstrate platonic love.

, While words go a long way, a gift is a concrete sign of your affection. Gifts can be as small or as big as you want. The important thing is that the gift was given with sincere feelings behind it. The types of gifts you might give depends on the type of love you're expressing:


Flowers are a very common gift to give to a romantic lover.
Less symbolic gifts, like concert tickets, may be given to friends or family.

, When people first begin to love, they rarely consider the long-term ramifications. It can feel amazing to love someone at first, but the greatest rewards come from a lot of persistence and effort from both sides. Once you have a strong relationship, don't get lazy; feed it every day. Whether that's through repeating the steps or exploring new ways, making love last is very important. If love was thought to be short-lived, it would never feel as powerful as it does.

, Before anything else, it is important to base your search for answers on a generally agreed-upon definition for the word love. Love may be casually described as a very strong affection for something or someone, although answers will vary from person to person.Chances are you have your own definition of love. Try to put your own definition into words.


Because love is something you feel, looking to art and music lets you feel someone else's interpretation directly. The Beatles are a great go-to in this regard, but there are great songs about love from virtually every era and style of music.
Writers and philosophers have given many different interpretations of love. You may want to seek out their opinions if you're having any doubt with your own definition., Love covers a wide variety of positive feelings for an all-encompassing range of human relationships. Think of all of the different types of connections you can foster with people. Most connections have the potential for a certain kind of love. A love you have for your parents or your children is distinct from the feelings you would have towards a lover. It is important to first consider these different types of love, and how they might ideally feel. While it could be categorized endlessly, Ancient Greek philosophers categorized love into four general categories:Eros refers to a romantic love. This is arguably the first type of love people think of when the term love is brought up.
Storge refers to a love of family and kinship.
Philia is a friendly love, also known as ""Platonic love.""
Agape was the Greeks' term for a ""divine love"", relating to spiritual matters.
Love can also be used to describe affection for an object or a concept. For instance, someone may love their car, or their country.

, However, most often this boils down to a case of infatuation. Judging infatuation as love muddles the value of love as a term. If you are thinking of romantic love, this can often refer to a confusion between love with a mostly physical attraction.


Although there is such a thing as love at first sight, it is much more likely that real love will develop gradually.

, When it all comes down to it, love is idealistic by nature. That doesn't mean it can't be a part of real life, but you do need to be realistic about what you define as love. Love can feel magical, but it's by no means fairy tale-like or perfect. You can love someone and still fight with them or dislike things about them. At the end of the day however, loving someone means the positives outweigh their negative traits, and you would go out of your way to help them out at no benefit to yourself. It is easy to idealize the notion of love, but there is real-life potential for it in virtually all of us.


Being realistic should not be confused with being jaded or cynical. Pessimism is another kind of bias. Just because it doesn't showcase things in a rose-tinted light doesn't mean it's presenting things as accurately as it should. Take the good along with the bad.

, How can you really know if you have loved before? Because love is intangible by its very nature, there is no one way of knowing for sure. Instead, take your personal definition of love and see if it matches any relationship (romantic or otherwise) you have been in. It may also help to categorize any loves you may have, be they platonic, romantic, familial or otherwise. If you know within reasonable doubt that you have indeed loved before, the act of loving someone should become more straightforward.


If you don't think you have ever loved before, it is possible your definition of love is too idealistic and strict.
If you are otherwise sure you have not loved before, the process of learning to love will entail keeping your attention focused on detecting new feelings you have not felt before, or at least a stronger degree of positive emotion than you're used to.

An excellent way to get to know your life-partner better is to exchange a favorite book with each other; then each of you actually read the exchanged book.",How to Maintain a Vibrant Romance," Even if you don’t cook often you can pick out an interesting recipe and surprise her with your new culinary skills. You guys out there should not underestimate what you could do with this idea. Most recipes are written well enough so that even a novice can follow the directions. You will make her feel real special if you take the effort to actually “wine and dine” her.;
, Many of these venues will offer a great campfire steak dinner after the trail ride. My experience with this was great! I can’t wait to do it again.

, Talk it over with your sweetheart and let him or her know that this is what you really want to do. Once you both agree then go ahead and sign up for lessons. Most organizations that provide this service will have a big dance with live music at the end of the lessons.

, Once you know where they are you can plan a romantic wine-tasting excursion. Bear in mind that most wineries have a gift shop where you can buy your sweetheart a nice gift.

, At the reception, you as a couple can secretly pretend that you are the bride and groom! Then at the end of the evening you can retire to your “honeymoon suite”. Need I say more?

, Plan a nice restaurant dinner around it. Does this sound rather mundane? What can make this idea more exciting is to dress to the nines. You know the song: “Every girl’s crazy ‘bout a sharp dressed man”? And you guys know what a nice evening dress can do, don’t you? Does this work for you now?

, Reserve a motel/hotel room so you will not be concerned with the trip back home. Beforehand, check a newspaper or internet site for events at the state fair that interest you the most, such as music concerts or fireworks.

, Pack a blanket and a picnic lunch, and don’t forget the wine. Plan to stop along the way for a romantic picnic in the wild.

Practice active listening.,
Buy her something personal.,
Laugh with her, not at her.,
Give her cute nicknames.,
Accept her as she is, don't try to change her.,
Take her out.",How to Love Your Girlfriend2," Bonding is important in any relationship, and the stronger your bond, the stronger your long-term relationship.Sharing an inside joke is a way to revisit times enjoyed in the past, which will remind your girlfriend the good experiences you have shared.

, Wash the hoodie she left at your house, buy nail polish in her favorite color, or bring her a favorite flower. Random acts of kindness will make her feel great, and have the added bonus of enhancing your own happiness., Even something as simple as offering your hand while she empties a rock out of her shoe will indicate that you love her enough to help with any problem, big or small.

, Your sense of smell is linked very closely to memory.Giving your girlfriend an article of clothing with your scent will keep her thinking of you even while you're away.

, Checking your phone every five or ten minutes during a date can leave your girlfriend feeling not only unimportant, but also frustrated.If you've planned a special day with her, set a firm boundary limiting distractions beforehand. Some effective boundaries are:


Promising yourself you will not use your phone unless there is an emergency situation.
Letting your friends know ahead of time that you have special one-on-one time planned with your significant other.

, This is also an important part of bonding and can promote a healthy relationship.Listen together to her favorite music, play a team sport like tennis, or take up something entirely new.


Do not sacrifice your own happiness for that of your girlfriend. This can lead to resentment, and do more harm than good. In the event you don't hold the same interest, encourage your girlfriend to pursue it while finding a suitable activity to engage yourself.

, A common complaint in relationships is a lack of communication. While conversing, attempt to maintain eye contact, give feedback through body language (nods, smiles, expressions), and provide feedback that summarizes what she has said in your own words.Active listening can be especially difficult for men, as it is at odds with typical male communication strategies.If you would like to learn more about active listening, why not look into how to Actively Listen?

, Or, better yet, make her something! The investment of your time for her sake is a clear sign that you care. These intimate gifts often carry great emotional value and can turn into valued mementos later in your relationship.

, Even if her quirks amuse you, be sensitive enough to recognize areas she is self-conscious. Take time to explain your perspective, and gently inquire about the root of the problem.


Respect her boundaries at all times, but by regarding the thing she is self-conscious about with tact, you will convey that it is important to you.

, Pet names are a social cue in a relationship; your terms of endearment can boost your relationship satisfaction.Keep her opinions in mind as you explore nicknames.


Choosing a nickname that upsets her will only do damage, especially if you follow the offending name up with laughter.

, Change is something that comes from within, and no matter how hard you might try, you cannot force your girlfriend to change if she isn't ready. If there is a particular issue that bothers you, work together to find an mutually acceptable resolution.

, You don't have to go to an expensive movie or a picnic, but a change of pace and scenery will allow for new experiences you can share together.Sometimes going to the place you first met can be romantic, or a walk around the park might give you time you need to truly appreciate each other.

Always greet her with a smile.,
Allow your physical contact to linger.,
Hold her hand.,
Notice and practice comforting touches.,
Randomly give her a peck.,
Look her deep in her eyes.,
Gather her up in your arms and kiss the top of her head.",How to Love Your Girlfriend3," Smiling is actually contagious, and when she catches your smile she'll know how excited you are to be with her.Some research even indicates that smiling makes you more attractive., Don't break off your hug like you can't stand to get away! Allow your embraces to last longer than ordinary. Rest her head in the crook of your neck.


Physical contact with other people releases oxytocin, also called the love hormone, into the blood.Longer touches translate to more oxytocin, drawing the two of you closer together.

, Hand holding is proven to reduce stress, so why not put your girlfriend at ease and take her hand?Use soft touches to relay a sense of happiness and generosity. Firm or hard touches can make her feel like you are being selfish or aggressive., Many people have a certain touch or caress that has a calming effect. Look for these in your girlfriend, and use them to say, ""I love you,"" without a word.

, You don't have to aim for the lips! The forehead, nose, and cheek are excellent landing zones for a quick kiss.

, Eye contact is one of the most universal ways of communication.Taking a moment to look deeply into her eyes can remind you both just how much you love each other., When in a rush, you may opt for the half-hug or a quick embrace with two pats to the back, but a safe, encompassing, heart-to-heart hug will make her feel like she's the only one in your life.

Distinguish between infatuation and love.,
Choose to love your partner.,
Be open and honest with each other.,
Date your partner all over again.,
Stay in love.,
Love the whole person.,
Do your part.",How to Love Somebody1," Infatuation is when you feel euphoria, happiness, excitement and a lot more that can be tough to put into words.During infatuation, you may see your relationship and your partner in an ideal way, but this feeling is temporary. Real lasting love is far more than a feeling. It is a faithful commitment that grows even when the feelings of infatuation fade away.


Feelings of infatuation can last up to two years all the while acting on your brain in a way that is not too different from drugs.;
, Accept your partner and avoid doing and saying things to bring your partner down. Critical comments, chronic sarcasm, and passive-aggressive behavior can destroy a relationship. Instead, show encouragement, kindness, and genuine concern for your partner. This will strengthen your bond.For example, if you're having trouble accepting your partner, try the 5:1 ratio. Offer five positive comments for each negative one. You'll soon discover how much you appreciate your partner., Sharing things with your partner can create emotional intimacy and make you feel closer to your partner.While this might seem scary, you'll eventually go from getting to know someone to understanding and caring for the person.


A good way to ease into emotional intimacy is to spend quality time with your partner. During this quality time, ask questions to learn more about your partner. Intimate questions can strengthen the emotional bond between two people., Think of when you were getting to know one another the first time. Remember how much you tried to impress your partner and how nervous you felt. Try to make the same effort to win your partner again., Remember what attracted you to your partner in the first place and choose to remain ""madly in love."" People who say they are ""madly in love"" have increased brain activity in the region identified with new love or infatuation.While it's important to remember the beginning, it is also important to recognize the present. It's still possible to keep that “new love” feeling toward your partner.

, Your partner may have changed since you fell in love. Regardless of what first attracted you, try to celebrate the way your partner has grown and avoid making focusing on the past. Just as you want to be loved for who you are now and today, so does your partner.Make a point of identifying and appreciating your partner’s qualities. Make your partner your standard of what you like most in a person. If your partner is tall and thin or short and curvy, let that become your ideal.

, Focus on changing your attitudes and expectations, rather than making your partner change. Your partner may not want to change the relationship or even stay in it. Don't try to control what is out of your hands. All you can do is focus on your actions and desires.You may spend some time loving the other person while your partner decides whether or not to stay in the relationship. During this time, don't force change. Let your partner make his own decision.

Have an open mind.,
Observe.,
Befriend different people.,
Stop Being judgmental.,
See Art.,
Volunteer.",How to Love Humanity," To love anything in general you need to accept the fact that they are not perfect - nothing is. You cannot expect the world to be in black and white. People have always been far from perfect and will continue to be so, they usually take a lot of time and effort to learn things. So whether it be a friend, family member, loved one or any person in general there should be a certain amount of leeway given to them for making errors.  Be forgiving instead of accusing and try to believe at least for the first time that any harm done was not intentionally caused. Be accommodating and kind.  Sometimes all some people need is a second chance and they might surprise you with it.;
, The news is always full of stories that discourage your faith in humanity - the murders, rapes, wars and famines. So we see the dark side of humanity highlighted and sometimes in that spectacle we forget that another side exists and sometimes it exists right under our noses and we fail to see it. We have become so accustomed to seeing the ugly side fo things that we have forgotten to appreciate the beauty.  So the next time you are talking to the to someone you know works three jobs try to see the emotion behind his unrelenting hardwork just so that his children can have an opportunity at a good education and have everything he probably didn't get a chance at. Maybe notice the homeless guy by the bus stop who takes out of his limited food to share with a stray dog.  There is always things like this around if you only look closely enough.

, Conversations with people completely different than you can change your view on things. We all settle down into life and have a fixed set of friends and family but sometimes we need to open up to the bigger world around us. Understand how others live and understand their points of view without judgment. Do not accept the scale by which the world labels people. It will help you grow and you might find a friend in a person you could never have thought to give a second glance to.

, 'If you judge people you will not have time to love them' it is as simple as that. People make choices in their lives that you might not understand or comprehend completely or even disagree with but if their choices do not harm anybody they are entitled to it. It is not necessary that you need to agree with everything a person does in order to have any sort of relation with them. You have the right to your opinions and the other person to their own. Do not define people only by their choices that you do not agree with.

, Every artist in some way is creating something from the essence of his own soul and if that does not trigger a sense of hope i don't know what will.


Novels provide an intimate insight into the mind of the author and a lot of times a journey into someone else's imagination is all it takes to revive your hope again. Never underestimate the power of reading a good book when you are feeling down. Books are a reminder that people can work magic.
Dance is another form of art that has the capability of telling a story beautifully. Attend a dance show and see the passion in the performers eyes when they take the stage to fulfill their part. There is a sort of reverence in every good performers eyes that you can always make out.
Listen to good music. It is something that requires no effort and is an instant feel good. Music has always been considered to have healing powers. It always helps.
Last but not the least try to practice art however badly. You will bleed your soul out into it and you will feel better about the world. You will have created something. You will have understood that humans can work miracles.

,  If you are not happy with the way things are going you should be the one who should stand up and change it. Volunteer at NGO's, become an activist for a cause that you believe in. Some or the other time your efforts are bound to pay off even if in just a small way. There might be no other nudge you need than just the satisfaction of having done something for humanity. Once you learn to work for the change you want to see instead of complaining about it and getting depressed you will not lose hope again.

Putting everything good about your partner down on a paper will help you realize the good in the person that you are with, and it might make you put more value into that person. You could also make a list about the good things in your relationship, or good memories. A good idea is also to give the list to your partner, for him/her to enjoy and let them know some of the things you that you like about them. Don't create any list with the negative things, this will only make them appear and feel worse.;
, It's important to have good communication with your partner. It makes both of you know that you are there for each other, if one of you needs to talk, and that you respect each other's opinions, wishes, experiences and dreams.

, You should always do something together, whether it's just lying in bed, watching a show or if it's going out to eat at a nice restaurant. Anything, with a certain amount of variation, will bring you closer together, as you realize that you do things together as a couple and that you have a good time when you do it.

, Make them fun. Whether it be walking the dog, going to the store, or just relaxing watching TV, quality time spent together strengthens the bond that two people share together. You should always do something together when the time is available. Anything with a certain amount of variation, will bring you closer together; you can enjoy doing things together as a couple and have a good time when you do it.

, But, not by picking at sore points. When you feel a little bored of life at home, it's a good idea to plan something different, and go out together. You can do something for fun; think about the dates that you had when you just started dating. Make each other laugh, play and be sort of silly! It's releasing, calming and strengthens your relationship.

, It doesn't have to be something expensive, it can even be something you have made yourself, or something simple as flowers, chocolate or a perfume or even a sensuous romantic massage after a long tiresome day. Do this once in a while, so that your partner remembers that you think about them.

, Poems are a great way of showing someone you care for them, especially because it takes time to write -- and it requires a lot of thinking about your feelings towards the person.

Understand friendship.,
Learn how to be a good friend.,
Resolve conflicts in your friendship.,
Protect and respect your friend.,
Respect your friend.",How to Love Somebody2," Friendship is when two people respect, accept, and appreciate each other.You may become friends with someone who shares similar interests or values with you. While some aspects of friendship love may seem similar to romantic love, there is one big difference. Romantic love is about melding and blending two people, but friendship is about being fully accepted as an individual.


Some close friends live thousands of miles apart and rarely speak, but when they do it is as if they were never apart.

, Don't take friendship for granted. Instead, work to keep your relationship strong. You can do this in several ways. Put your friend's needs ahead of your own when it counts. Be available for your friend, even if it's inconvenient for you. More importantly, be the kind of friend you'd like to have.The beauty of friendship is that you appreciate each other’s differences. But, sometimes those differences can be dividing. Are you able to set aside what you want to support your friend in making the best choices for himself?

, If you and your friend are fighting, don't be afraid to talk about it. Put yourself in your friend's shoes to understand his viewpoint. If you aren't sure what's wrong or what the solution is, ask your friend. If it's something minor, patch things up. If not, respectfully let your friend you've given it some thought, have listened to him, and disagree.Keep your tone conversational and respectful. Truly listen to his point of view without judgment.

, While this doesn't mean becoming his bodyguard, you should commit to caring for his emotions and supporting him. Part of this means that you'll need to protect your friend from your own selfishness. Selfishness is a part of human nature, but learn to protect and put your friend before your own needs.


For example, if you really want to go see that new movie, but you know your friend has an early appointment, don't pressure them. Instead, support your friend and reschedule for a more convenient time to see the movie.

, Respect your friend even when he's not around. No one enjoys being talked about or discussed behind their back. Avoid starting gossipy conversations, and be firm in redirecting or stopping such discussions if they start. Your friend should be able to trust you with his vulnerabilities.


Your friend may feel betrayed to learn that you didn't protect him or stand up for him. It may even cause the end of the friendship.

Choose to love your relative.,
Create clear expectations.,
Set boundaries.,
Repair your relationship.",How to Love Somebody3," Loving your family member is a lot like loving someone else; it requires commitment. Don't think that loyalty alone is enough to keep your relationship strong. It will require work, but familial love should offer a strong, safe, supportive loving place.The stronger your relationships are with people in your life, the better you will be at taking care of others. If you have a poor relationship with a family member, you may have a hard time being as empathetic or compassionate as you could be., Start by accepting the relative for who he is and make expectations that both of you can meet. As you both meet expectations, make more. You may want to start off with infrequent meetings, gradually increasing them as you both learn to love and understand each other.


Be clear in your expectations and consequences. For example, if you invite your family member to dinner once a week, then he needs to be there when he says he will. If he doesn't, follow through with a consequence., Boundaries create manageable expectations for interactions and behavior. So, if a challenging family member has a way of being unreliable or sporadic in your life, create a boundary of expectation. This can help both of you work on creating a relationship. You can even negotiate the boundaries, just stick firm to the aspects that are most important to you.Know when to bend and when to stand firm. For example, if the relative often breaks expectations that you agreed on, ask yourself if you want to repair the relationship or let the relative go. You aren't responsible for anyone else's emotions or choices.

, You'll need to stop your negative thoughts, change your words, and choose your actions carefully. Choose to change your thoughts and words about your relative. Find something you can appreciate and focus your thoughts on their positives. Treat your family member as though you already have the relationship you would like.


If you decide that you want to repair a damaged relationship with your relative, realize that you can't change anyone but yourself. Your relative may never change.

Treat yourself right.,
Be kind to yourself.,
Forgive yourself.",How to Love Somebody4," Care about your appearance. You pass your own reflection several times a day, you might as well like what you see. It will help build your confidence for when you are around others. If you don't like yourself, then you may become critical of others. So do what you need to do to like yourself and show kindness to yourself.


Make sure you are eating healthy and exercising. Committing to just twenty minutes of exercise a day can help you teach your own mind that you have worth., Recognize you are a work in progress. You need space to grow and experience new things. Don't let fear of mistakes keep you from trying new things and branching out as a person. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them.


For example, make time for hobbies and activities you enjoy or want to learn. Encourage yourself to learn new skills. Treat yourself the way you'd treat a friend., Learning how to forgive yourself will keep you from projecting your self-issues on someone you could love. Taking care of yourself allows you to love and appreciate others, not just yourself.


Anger and guilt can take a toll on your health. Resenting yourself can increase your stress levels. This stress can cause or worsen heart disease, autoimmune disease, and cancer."
"
Be yourself and have realistic goals.,
Cultivate loving behaviors.,
Be a good communicator.,
Avoid abusive relationship patterns.",How to Love Somebody5," You'll find it harder to be truthful in relationships where you're not acting like your true self. Don't hide who you are. Instead, learn that others should accept you for who you are. Set achievable goals for yourself. These should build on your characteristics, not turn you into someone you're not.


For example, if you're a quiet person with a small group of close friends, don't challenge yourself to become the most popular person at school. Chances are, this wouldn't make you happy and you'd be doing it for the wrong reasons.

, You'll be able to foster loving relationships if you act in a loving, compassionate manner. This means being trustworthy, respectful, and kind. While this may sound simple, you'll need to keep evaluating how loving you are.Showing loving traits takes practice. Don't give up, but continue to improve your loving qualities. Your relationships will benefit from your efforts.

, This doesn't just mean being talkative. Instead, you should try to be skilled at honest, open communication. This includes actively listening to the other person. Learn to ask questions and be specific when talking.The other person will feel more engaged.


Remember to be personal. Think about how what you're saying will be received by the other person. Try to make a personal connection.

, Never intimidate, blame, emotional abuse, threaten, isolate, or talk down to another person.This controlling behavior is really just a way for one person to gain power over the other. When this happens, a healthy, loving relationship is not possible.


Relationship abuse gradually worsens over time. If you think you are in an abusive relationship, seek outside help. Remember, you deserve to be in a healthy, loving relationship."

Communicate.,
If you have a computer, download a chat program such as Skype, Yahoo, MSN Message to name a few.,
Along with a computer and a chat program, you might want to invest in a webcam, preferred with a built in microphone.,
Make sure to mention what he/she means to you always.,
Speak of your love for him/her always.,
Send to him/her maybe a song you think he/she will love or a song you are feeling for them at that time through the internet by either e-mail or as you talk in chat you can send it in the chat box.

,
Send pictures or videos of yourself to him/her to let him/her know you are thinking always of them.,
Write letters!,
Write e-mails when possible, it will give him/her something to look forward to everyday when they check their e-mails and other business he/she may have online.

,
ALWAYS say what you mean and mean what you say!",How to Love from Afar," Communication is the first thing you want to have and have it often. Think of communication as the fuel for a fire, without it the fire dies or should I say the love dies. You want to have contact daily if possible. One way that is most used is the telephone. Call him/her as much as you possibly can and afford to do. If it is state to state check to see if your home and/or cell phone has statewide coverage. If he/she is in another country, there are some calling packages you may want to check on with your calling service or there is also calling cards which can be bought at stores. Check on the internet for international calling cards which many times are a lot cheaper than your home or cell services.;
, This is a cheaper way of contact and communication between the two of you. Choose a time to be online the same time and time to talk or chat. Daily would be the minimum if possible.

, Download the program for the webcam and when you talk to your love in let's say Skype, you can invite your love to see you on the cam as you chat. If it has a built-in mic, you can also talk to him/her and it will not cost you. Seeing your love and talking will keep your love burning and longing.

, How you have missed them, what you remember about them or of a time together. Keep them up to date on the events of the day, any plans you may have for the day, or week.

, Reassuring him/her of that love always, especially since the two of you are so far away.

,, The video can have you saying something to him/her of your thoughts or feelings.

, Today letter writing is seldom done but sending a love letter or a poem through the regular mail is not only romantic, but it is also telling him/her how much you care and love them to take the time to write it and send it.

,, Distance is hard enough for love so when you communicate make sure you follow through in all you say to him/her.

Stand on higher ground.,
Stand up straight.,
Hug the girl while she is sitting down.",How to Hug a Girl Who's Taller Than You1," You can help even out the height difference by initiating the hug from a spot where you are standing on higher ground than she is. You can be just high enough to be at the same height or you can actually be taller than her.If the height difference is significant, you could stand on the stairs or even on a box or something nearby.
Being outdoors offers a lot of options for choosing higher ground. You could stand on a curb while she stands on the sidewalk. You can stand at a higher point on a hill. Look for tree roots or a rock that you can stand on.;
, Since you are already shorter, don’t make it worse by slouching. Lift your head up high and keep your shoulders broad but relaxed. You’ll put yourself in a better position for the hug as well as project confidence showing that her tallness does not bother you.Raise yourself onto the balls of your feet just slightly. Don’t stand on your tiptoes but you can give yourself a small one inch boost to even out the height difference a little bit.
Standing up straight with your head high, your shoulders raised, and your feet flexed can add two or three inches to your height.

, In general, it’s harder to hug when someone is sitting down, but if you are shorter it can help. Simply lean down to her level with your arms over her shoulders, hands touching her back, and lay your head on her shoulder or against the side of her head.


This may feel like you’ve created an awkward angle, but it will help you feel better because you will be taller in this type of hug.

It's possible that he'll act more natural around his male friends, while he'll go into ""boyfriend mode"" when he's with you. If you want to get to know and love the real him, get to know his buddies.


Invite them over for a meal, or to have some beers at your place if you want to entertain. Or come along with him on one of his handouts, if you're invited, and hang out with the guys.
If you don't like his friends, that's fine, but try to keep it to yourself as much as possible. Let him hang out with them when he wants, and keep your date time separate.

, If your guy comes over and you've baked him an apple pie and gotten the UFC pay-per-view? You'll be pretty much the best partner ever. Find out what kinds of things your guy really likes and do them just because, whenever you can.


Bring him lunch at work, or sneak into the shower with him in the morning before he leaves. Let yourself be five minutes late.
Surprises for birthdays and other holidays are nice, but they're not really surprises. To really show your guy some love, do it on a typical Wednesday.
Surprises will all depend on the guy. Some guys would love it if you just showed up at his place with a pizza, while others might be mortified. Use your own judgment and make sure you know your guy.

, While it's important to spend lots of time with someone you love, it's also important to spend enough time apart. If you love your boyfriend, let him hang out with his friends and do things alone. Respect his privacy when it comes to alone time.


Some guys will want to hang out every day, while others may require a lot of down time, or time alone. That doesn't mean he loves you less, or that something's wrong. It might just mean that he needs some time alone.
If you don't like being alone, then schedule lots of time with your own friends when your guy wants to hang out separately. Hang out with the girls, or see your family for a while.
Part of love is trusting your guy enough to tell you the truth. If he hasn't given you any reason to break that trust, you don't need to text him fifty times to keep tabs on him when he's out having fun with his friends.

, Loving someone means that you get to know them on an emotional level that's deep, maybe deeper than you've ever known someone before. If you want to learn to love your boyfriend, it's important to spend lots of time talking. Ask him open-ended questions to get him talking and listen. See what he has to say. See what he's like. Get to know him.


While guys have a reputation for being silent, most guys will open up when you get them in private and talk about the right things. Talking about his hopes and dreams and emotions? Not so much. Talking about subjects he's passionate about? Now you're talking.
If this is your first relationship, spend lots of time talking to your boyfriend and getting to know him before you do anything you won't be able to take back. Don't have sex or send inappropriate pictures to anyone you don't really know, just because your'e ""going out.""

, Your relationship should be a source of joy and love, not a wrestling match between two angry scorpions who are trapped together. If you want to cultivate a loving and close relationship with your boyfriend, it's important to try to keep things as positive and loving as possible at all times.Tell him regularly what you like about him. Write down a list of the things that you love about your boyfriend, that you're attracted to, and that you're This helps you to remind yourself as well, if you've forgotten.
When bad things happen, as they will, try to handle them like an adult. If you have an argument, try not to scream and yell, but calm down and take a break if necessary. Talk about things when you're in a calm mood.

, If you want to love your guy, then be in his corner. If he's having a rough time at school or work, encourage him to do his best. If he's successful, compliment him and remind him that he's doing a good job. Be a positive presence in his life.


Sometimes, encouragement should be hard. If your guy's been doing nothing but slugging brews and playing Xbox lately, then maybe he needs to be encouraged to spend his time a little more wisely. Talk with him about what he wants to do and encourage him in his interests, so he'll be more fulfilled.

, Try to avoid nagging or criticizing your guy, especially if he's having a rough time. Most guys will respond better to positive encouragement than to negatives. If your guy is doing something you don't like, give him the hint by suggesting different ways of doing things, instead of rubbing his face in his failures.

, Guys appreciate it when you cut to the chase and speak your mind. If you have an opinion about something, share it. If you're angry, say so. If something turns you on, tell him what it is so he'll do it again. Don't try to be subtle with a guy, just come right out and say it.


Learn to recognize his personal signals. Some guys will close down and stop talking if they're upset. That doesn't mean you need to ask ""What's the matter?"" fifty times an hour. Some guys will open up if you give them some space.

, Don't expect him to read your mind. If you're feeling hurt by something he said, don't just give him the silent treatment and expect him to figure it out. Be clear and be open. Be honest with him. That's a lot better than sneaking around and trying to drop hints.

, One thing that helps a guy feel valuable and loved is to feel useful. If you need some help with


Asking him to help you with things you don't need help with might just come off as annoying.

, It's a lot easier to love someone if you're seeing him at his best. If you know you're going to hate going to the football game with him and watching him scream and yell while you're bored, don't tag along just to be together. Spend your time doing something else instead and be together when you've got your own date time.


Don't force him to do things he doesn't want to do. If he's going to gripe and complain to come along to an office party with you, don't drag him along. You'll have more fun alone.

, It's important to open yourself up to love and affection. Try to let go of anxiety and love yourself as you love your boyfriend. If you have issues with anxiety and self-esteem, it's important to work on those issues separately from your relationship with your boyfriend.


If you struggle with anxiety issues, or struggle in other ways, talk to someone about it. Seek out a doctor, or a close friend to talk about your anxiety. You can be open and honest with your boyfriend, but don't burden him with your issues if it hurts your relationship.Look your best so you feel confident and loving with your boyfriend. You don't have to look any particular way to love your boyfriend, but if it would make you feel more confident and loving with your boyfriend, make some little changes. Get in shape or dress up if it will help.

, Before you're physically intimate with your boyfriend, make sure that you want to and that you're old enough and responsible enough to show your love physically. Always practice safe sex and communicate with your boyfriend before you do.


If your boyfriend will only be with you if you have sex before you're ready, or send him pictures on your phone that you don't want to send, break up with him. He's manipulating you and is being unfair. Love yourself enough to stand up for yourself and move at your own speed.

, Lots of people think that the guy will always initiate the kissing and the physical love part of a relationship. This doesn't have to be the case. If you want to show your boyfriend that you love him, don't wait around for him to make a move. If you're feeling love, make a move yourself every now and then. This will help him to feel loved, and will help you to feel closer to him.

, Even if you've been together a while, try to remember what it was like when you first got together and rekindle some of that attitude when you're together. Tell him that he turns you on. Tell him what you want to do together.


Leave him little notes throughout the day if you want to turn your boyfriend on. Delay the gratification, so you'll keep the sexual tension up all day until you get back to your place.Tease him physically as well. Give him a little kiss on the side of the neck when you're out in public together and whisper in his ear. Drive him wild.

, Your love life can get stale pretty quickly if you don't put some work into it. If you want to love your boyfriend, find little ways to keep your life in and out of the bedroom fresh and exciting for you.


Try having sex at different times and in different places than normal. If you want to do it, don't always do it in the same place.
Try out new moves. Experiment with some kink. Dress up and role-play. Talk about what you like, and find out what he likes. All guys are different. It's always better to find out from your boyfriend what feels good and what turns him on, instead of reading some list on the Internet or from a magazine.

Put your arms around her midsection.,
Turn your head to the side.,
Position for a side hug.",How to Hug a Girl Who's Taller Than You2," As the shorter person, it won’t work to put your arms over her shoulders as you would with someone shorter. Wrap your arms around her ribcage, keeping your forearms close to each other.You can vary your hand placement in this position. You can place your hands up on her shoulder blades while keeping your elbows by her sides. If its a more romantic hug, you can also keep your hands low on her back reaching one toward each of her sides.

, When you give a face-to-face hug to a taller girl, one main goal is to make sure you don’t awkwardly stick your face into her chest. The easiest way to avoid this is to turn your head to the side. If your head has to touch her chest, it’s better to lay your ear against her chest rather than putting your face into her chest.


If you are only a few inches shorter, this really won’t be a big issue. It’s most important when you are short enough that your face is at her chest level.

, If you are short enough that your face is closer to her chest level, you can avoid that awkward closeness by giving her a side hug instead. Do this by angling one side of your body toward her and one side away. Slip one arm around her back and pull her toward you.


Your shoulder will be slightly under her shoulder and your bodies will be touching from the chest down to the hips.
For added intimacy to compensate for less body contact, you can tilt your head toward her as an invitation for her to lean down and touch your head with hers.

Be confident and relaxed.,
Make sure she's okay with contact.,
Consider your environment.",How to Hold Your Girlfriend Romantically1," Your touch can communicate many things to her, but what you may not know is it can also communicate your state of mind. If you are feeling nervous, tense, or fearful, your girlfriend will very likely be able to sense it through your touch.If you are feeling nervous about holding your girlfriend, remind yourself she's your girlfriend for a reason (she likes you!), and that she's probably hoping you'll take her hand or put your arm around her.


Be confident, but not cocky. While it's likely your girlfriend is looking forward to your touch, don't assume you have free access to her body at any time. Be respectful of her space.
Calm yourself by breathing in for four seconds, then breathing out for four seconds.Repeat this at least four times and you should begin to feel more at ease.
If you're still nervous, pinch yourself in the fleshy part between your thumb and index finger. Applying pressure to this area can quickly calm your nervous system.;
, The easiest way to do this is by simply asking her. Saying ""Can I hold you?"" is not only sweet, it's also a way to know 100% for sure she's comfortable with being touched. You can also try touching her in non-threatening areas, like her upper back or between her elbow and her hand, and watch her reaction.Pay close attention to her body language. People can very accurately read each others emotions via touch--if they're paying attention. If she seems uncomfortable in any way--if her muscles tense, she avoids eye contact, or you just get a vibe that she doesn't like it, stop what you're doing.
Don't be upset or offended if your girlfriend isn't in the mood to be touched. It probably has little to do with you--some people simply don't like to be touched. It doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't like you.
Think about how long you've been dating or any statements she's made in the past about her limits. It's not a good idea to grab her butt after you've been dating for a week, especially if she's expressed that she wants things to go slow.

, If you're in the middle of the lunchroom or at a family gathering, you probably won't want to hold her the same way you do when it's just the two of you sitting on the couch. It can make things awkward for her and the people around you. If you're around her parents, it might even get her in trouble!


When you're in public, keep things PG--just hold hands, or put your arms around each other, or maybe put your hand in her back pocket. Save the cuddling and really intimate stuff for when you're alone.

Hide the hickey with the right shirt.,
Hide the hickey with the right accessory.",How to Hide a Hickey1," Wearing a shirt or sweater to hide your hickey may be the easiest way to protect your love bite from the world. Whether you're a male or female, here are a few things you can try:


A turtleneck sweater.
A turtleneck long-sleeved shirt.
A jacket or a sweater with a collar that covers your neck. Just make sure you normally wear this type of thing, or your friends will be more likely to notice your hickey because they will be laughing at your popped collar.
Don't wear a turtleneck in the middle of the summer. That will just draw more attention to your neck. Girls can still try wearing tank tops with a high collar while they're still trendy.
Wear a top that draws attention away from your neck. Try wearing a shirt that has a funny logo on it, stripes, or an unusual zipper. The busier your top, the less likely people will be to look at your neck.;
, The right accessory can also help hide your hickey if your shirt just isn't doing the trick. Here are some accessories to try:


A scarf is the most common accessory to use to hide your hickey. Just make sure you're wearing it during the right season and that if you're indoors, you don't look weird when you keep your scarf on. And you may want to avoid wearing a scarf if you never wear a scarf.
If you're really preppy, drape a sweater across your shoulders, but only do it if you've tried this look before.
If you're desperate, you can stick a bandage over the hickey and make up a story. If you're a guy, you can use a bug bite as an excuse, and if you're a girl, you can say you burned yourself with a curling iron. If you have a cat, you can say he scratched you. But remember that making up a story is more likely to draw attention to you.
If you're a girl or a long-haired man, then obviously covering your hickey with your hair is the way to go. Just make sure you check to see that your hair is in place.
Avoid wearing jewelry that draws attention to your neck. Ladies, instead of wearing a necklace or earrings, wear cool rings or bracelets. Men, put away your dog tags or chains, and wear a watch instead.

Hold her hand.,
Put your arm around her waist.,
Hug her romantically.,
Approach her from behind and wrap your arms around her.",How to Hold Your Girlfriend Romantically2," Holding hands will not only make you feel connected, it will declare to the world: ""We are a couple!"" Get close to her so that you are shoulder-to-shoulder. You can notice how she reacts to this first touch, and your hands will be close enough so you can hold hers easily.


If you're nervous and your palms are sweating (which is normal and ok, but not always the best feeling sensation), quickly wipe them on your pants before reaching for her hand.
Try hooking your pinkie finger with hers. This is a good move if you haven't held hands yet or you're nervous--it's very flirtatious and makes it easy for her to drop your hand if she isn't feeling the hand-holding yet.
Slide your hand under hers so that they are palm-to-palm.
Lace your fingers through hers so your hands are clasped together. Or try hooking your thumb over hers and wrapping your fingers around the back of her hand--the way you would hold your hands if you were making a ""begging"" gesture.
You may want to change positions every few minutes so your palms don't get too sweaty.

, This is a romantic way to hold your girlfriend if you are walking next to each other or standing and watching something. It is especially good if there is a height difference between you, since you can slide your hand down to her hip or up near her ribs.


While walking side-by-side, reach your arm across her back and place your hand on her waist.
Gently pull her toward you so she is snuggled against your body, under your arm.
Be sensitive to the fact that she might not want to be touched near her stomach. Some girls are a little self-conscious about their waist and may not be comfortable being touched there--especially if you squeeze her.
If she seems uncomfortable with your hand at her waist, try sliding it up to the bottom of her ribs, or simply putting your arm around her shoulders instead.

, This should be done when you are facing each other. This is something probably best done in private, as it's rather intimate and may lead to some kissing, since you'll be face-to-face.


Slide your hands under your girlfriend's arms and wrap them around her back. Slowly pull her toward you so that your bodies are pressed together, but not too tight!
Rest your chin gently on the top of her head, look down into her eyes, or nuzzle your head against her neck.
If she is comfortable with this, let your arms slide down so that you are embracing her around her waist.

, This is a cute way to surprise her, but you should be sure you are already familiar with her boundaries and that she's okay with being touched.


Walk up to your girlfriend from behind and slide your hands under her arms.
Wrap your arms around her waist in a backwards hug. Kiss the top of her head, her cheek, or her neck for a little added romance.

"
Put your arm around her shoulder.,
Try spooning your girlfriend if you are lying together on the couch.,
Put your arm around her shoulders when you are lying down.",How to Hold Your Girlfriend Romantically3," This move is classic for a reason--it allows you to hold your girlfriend against you and invites her to rest her head on your shoulder.


When sitting side by side, drape your arm across her upper back. You can hold her arm or shoulder with your hand or run your hand up and down her arm.
After a few minutes, try gently running your fingers through her hair.
If you are very comfortable with each other, take your free arm and slide it under her knees, encouraging her to lift her legs and drape them across your lap.
If she's resting her head on your shoulder, you can rest your head on the top of her head.

, Lie down on your side behind your girlfriend. She should also be on her side. Wrap your arm around her and pull her back against you, so her back is pressed against your chest.


You may have to move around a bit to figure out what to do with the arm that is beneath you. It can quickly become uncomfortable if your arm gets pinned underneath your body weight or your girlfriend.
Make it even more intimate by intertwining your legs together while you're spooning.

, If you two are having a lovely day in the park and decide to stretch out on your backs and gaze at the sky, now is a perfect time to bring her close to you. If you are not already side by side, scoot over so you are close to her.


Slide your arm under her neck or have her lift her head so you can get your arm around her.
Place your hand on her shoulder and gently pull her toward you.
This position will allow her to rest her head on your chest or arm. She may remain laying on her back or roll onto her side so she is facing you.
Use your free hand to run your fingers through her hair or caress her face.

Gather materials.,
Apply yellow corrector to the inside of the hickey.,
Apply green corrector to the rest of the hickey.,
Apply concealer over the hickey.,
Apply foundation.",How to Hide a Hickey2," Whether you're a girl with a lot of makeup, or a guy who has to ask a girl for help or to do the walk of shame to the drugstore, it's important to have all of the right materials before you start covering your hickey up with makeup. Here's what you need to get the job done:Green corrector.
Purple corrector.
Concealer.
A make-up brush.
Foundation (optional).

, The trick is to apply the color opposite on the color wheel to balance out and neutralize the color of the hickey. The inside of your hickey will be purple while the outside will be more red, so you'll need to use yellow to color the inside of the hickey.


Apply the yellow corrector gently to the inside of the hickey, using a thin brush.

, Clean your brush and use it to apply the green corrector to the remaining red part of the hickey.

, Find a concealer that matches your skin tone and apply it over the hickey with your make-up brush. If you're not sure about which shade is best, first try using it on the other side of your neck to see if it blends in.


Once you've applied it with the brush, you can dab it with your fingers to set it into your skin.
Bring the make-up with you wherever you go so you can reapply it in case it smudges during the day.
To ensure that the makeup lasts as long as possible, apply a translucent powder on top of the concealer to lock it in place (if it looks too powdery, spray some setting spray on top).

, If you want extra coverage for your hickey, you can apply a layer of foundation to keep the hickey hidden.


Apply the foundation with a foundation brush and use a sponge to blend it in further.

Wait 15-20 minutes.,
Apply a cold compress to the hickey.,
Repeat if necessary.",How to Hide a Hickey3," Do this gently and lightly to increase the circulation around the area. If you press too hard, you could make the hickey worse.Use a brand-new toothbrush.

, The redness and swelling will spread, but it will tone down if you wait.

, Leave it there for another 15-20 minutes.

, If you see that your hickey is less noticeable, try the method again. If you see that you've made it worse by brushing too hard, then keep icing it and wait for it to go away.

A cold spoon. Moisten a spoon with water and put it in the fridge for five minutes.
In a pinch, grab a frozen item out of your freezer and hold it against your hickey.

, Leave it on for a while, then take a break, and apply the ice again. If you're feeling too much pain, put the ice away for a while.



Do not apply ice directly to the hickey. Make sure it is covered by a cloth, paper towel, or zip-lock bag.
If you're using a spoon, you should place it in the freezer every five minutes to keep it cool, or keep a few cold spoons in the freezer to speed up the process.

Do not apply heat to your hickey right away. You should only do this after 48 hours of getting your hickey. If you just got your hickey, apply ice and begin massaging the area.

, Once your neck is warm enough, use your fingers to rub the hickey in a circle, from the inside of the hickey outwards.


This will help break up the blood clots and will improve circulation in the area.

, Drag your fingers from the center to the outer edges of the hickey.


Remember to be gentle. If you apply too much pressure, you can make it worse.

Know that having sex does not mean that you need to fall in love.,
Avoid sleeping with people you share romantic history with.,
Ask yourself what you are looking for in the hook-up.,
Casual hook-ups aren't for everyone, but that is okay.,
Set your boundaries.,
Don't hook up every chance you get with the same person.,
Make pleasure the priority in the relationship.,
Re-examine your relationship goals every few weeks.,
Leave when you're uncomfortable.",How to Have Sex Without Falling in Love1," Having sex and falling in love are very different things. Most people are taught by movies, TV, and even friends/family that having sex will always lead to love. Love, however, is a complex and nuanced emotion that develops over time, building as you get to know someone emotionally and socially, not just physically.


After orgasm women release a hormone called oxytocin, also known as the ""cuddle chemical"" that mimics feelings of connection and love. This is why, regardless of their logical thoughts about a person, love is often confused with sex.;
, It is hard to return to friendship after a romantic or sexual relationship. Adding sex back into the mix, however, will always resurface feelings of love and attraction. One of the things that separate friends from couples is a lack of sexual connection. Rekindling your sex life together will rekindle the feelings involved as well, whether you want them or not.


This includes sleeping with close friends, as your existing connection, when mixed with sex, leaves very little separating you from becoming a couple., Why do you want to have sex with someone? Are you trying to have a little fun, experiment with new people, or feel lonely? You need to know your goals going in, because they will profoundly affect how attached you get to someone. Be honest with yourself to prevent confusion in the aftermath of the hook-up., If you tend to fall for every person you sleep with or are looking for a partner, then you should think twice about having casual sex. If you just want to have fun, have no interest or desire for a relationship, and feel like experimenting a bit, you should feel free to proceed.Hooking-up without developing strings is easier if you just want to have some fun and learn more about your sexual needs.
Hooking-up because you are lonely, recently heartbroken, or hurting is often a recipe for unwanted attraction, as you try and compensate for your feelings with your new sexual partner.

, Are their things that automatically signal intimacy? Some people refrain from kissing their hook-up partner, as it feels too close to a real relationship. Other people prefer not to cuddle after the fact, or won't hook up with strangers. Have your boundaries set before you head out for the night and stick to them, as this will protect you and your heart from getting too invested.


Long conversations spent getting to know one another, especially on an intimate level (goals, worries/fears, personal history), often lead to love and feelings of attraction.Always wear protection when hooking up with someone., Spend time apart to protect your feelings from turning into something more serious. If you've established with your partner that you are seeing other people casually as well, mix things up so that you don't fall too far for one person.

, Don't stay over and cuddle, go on dates, or spend time talking late into the night. If you want to maintain a no-strings-attached, purely physical relationship, you need to stay purely physical. Focus on enjoying your time together, making sure both of you are satisfied when you leave but little else. A direct line on pleasure, instead of intimacy, is crucial to keep the relationship from developing into broader feelings.


Gifts, dates, and sleepovers all lead to more intimate feelings. Focus on what feels good and, once you are happy, leave., Do you feel yourself developing feelings for someone? More importantly -- are you enjoying the ""No Strings Attached"" lifestyle? Some people find hooking up with random sexual partners hollow, unfulfilling, and awkward despite the immediate pleasure. You are constantly evolving, growing, and changing, and your sexual preferences are no exception.How do you feel after a hook-up? Do you want to stay around but feel compelled to leave?
Do you feel like trying something more permanent? Are you leaving something special because you told yourself you didn't want a relationship, or because you actually don't love this person?

, If the type of sex your partner is giving you isn't what you want, leave. Sex without love is for the physical benefit for both of you, and if one person is not interested or doesn't care for what the other party is giving then they are free to leave. Remember, this is not a romantic relationship. There is no need to fear emotional baggage and how the other party might feel if you break things off casually.


""I think I'm ready to look for something more permanent, but this has been fun.""
""I'd rather not keep doing this casually.""
""I'd love to keep in touch, but I'm ready to see other people now.""

Casually flirt with acquaintances, casual friends, or friends of friends to see if you have sexual chemistry.,
Communicate your intentions with your partner.,
Act like friends, not lovers.,
Be honest if you are seeing other people.,
Try casual dating apps to find people interested in hooking up.,
Break things off when only one person develops romantic feelings.",How to Have Sex Without Falling in Love2," You do not need to get deep with someone, talking about your life, work, and goals or dreams. Casual flirting is more about smiles, light teasing, and occasional touching. If they reciprocate, then you're likely developing a rapport that can lead to a casual fling. Some hints to drop while flirting include:


""I've had my share of relationships, and I am definitely not looking for any commitment right now.""
""I'm just here to have fun and meet someone cute."", You need to be clear and upfront with someone you are hooking up with from the beginning. If you are not you may lead someone to expect more than you are willing to give, ending in one-sided relationships that will end poorly for everyone. While this conversation can be awkward, the best advice is to come right out and say what you want:


""I am not looking to start a relationship or begin dating.""
""I want something casual, not a girlfriend/boyfriend.""
""Let's have something light and fun.""

, There is no need to be gushy, overly-loving, or cuddly if you both want a quick hook-up. You wouldn't kiss your friend and send them flowers at work, so you shouldn't do it with a casual sexual relationship. But there is also no need to act ashamed, awkward, or aloof when with someone. Have a sense of humor about everything, enjoy each other's company, and keep things light. This will allow you to get everything out in the open, preventing bottled up emotions or stepping over the line.


When you see someone again the next day, be kind and cordial -- a hug and hello is not the same as asking for a date., You need to be upfront if you are keeping multiple partners ""on-retainer."" If you are hooking up with more than one person, your partner deserves to know. Remember, however, that if they take offense or would rather be with someone exclusively then you can both easily go your separate ways. If they believe you are exclusive and you keep seeing them, they may get the idea the relationship is going to develop into something more serious.


Casually bring up funny, light, or interesting stories of other hook-ups to make it clear you are not exclusive.
""I'm not looking to be exclusive right now, I hope that's okay with you?""

, Apps like Tinder and Grindr were developed to help people interested in finding casual relationships in their area. You can download them for your phone, make a quick profile, and start talking with someone in your area almost immediately.


Always meet in a public location first.
Don't ever give personal or financial information -- your name is more than enough.
Drive yourself to and from your meet-up location.
Tell a friend or family member your plans to meet someone, your location, and when you plan on returning., If you or your partner starts to fall in love, but the other person still wants to stay casual, you need to end the relationship. Trying to ""work through"" it, or convince someone to drop their feelings and go back to something less intense will never work, and the longer you stay together the stronger the feelings will get. Remember that this began as something casual -- it can end casually too. Things to say include:


""This has been fun, but I'd like to look for something a little more serious.""
""This has been fun, but I'm not available for anything serious right now, and I'm going to see some other people.""
If something is in the early stages, stop making a move or trying to flirt, even if you think it is ""harmless.""

Arrange rendezvous: Set times and places to meet where you know you will get some privacy.,
If meeting after hours pick a place far from your work location, you will be easily spotted in the pub on the corner.,
Don't leave any evidence: this can be anything from an undeleted email, to lipstick marks, to misplaced underwear.,
Head off the gossip: at some point, someone will start to get suspicious.,
If you decide to have an extended lunch break, always ask permission from your boss first and only if your boss says it's OK.,
Do not show public displays of affection.,
Remember professionalism and discretion in the workplace is key.",How to Have a Secret Office Romance," If you prefer email try Flagebuzz. Avoid using your mobile/office phone.;
, Maintain a work like demeanor at all times - avoid touching, lingering looks, or intimate conversations. If anything, give your partner a wider berth than other colleagues.

, Arrange your rendezvous like an MI5 agent: plan cover stories, arrive from different directions and think about escape routes. An empty stairwell, where you can hear people coming, is preferable to a stationary cupboard, where you can be easily caught unawares.

, Remember to travel there separately, nothing will arouse suspicion more than the 2 of you leaving together.

, Cover your tracks at all times. Avoid sending emails through the company system as it will only be a matter of time before one gets accidentally sent to Matt in accounts. And never commit the ultimate sin - turning up to work in the same clothes two days in a row. This is a sure fire sign that you didn't make it home the night before, and will start rumors before you can say 'scandalous'

, Quell any gossip surrounding you and your amour by ruthlessly starting more salacious rumors.

, If anyone asks why you are having an extended lunch break, say everything else, e.g. I have a lot of flex-it-ime and I need to use it and I'm going to have a little longer mooching in town and shopping. If you are asked did you see X? be honest but brief with an answer such as Yes I did, but don't tell them every little detail what you and X did, talked about etc. All in all keep extended lunch breaks to every now and then - If done frequently it can cause your boss, other people and the gossips to cotton on.

, It is best to leave kisses and hugs when the two of you are on your own, there is no-one else approaching, hearing and when the two of you are outside work and outside work hours (e.g. both of you are at home, on leave, on flexi day). Don't give the nosy parkers and/or the gossips any ammunition. Plus you never know who could spread the news to your colleagues and/or your boss when you are not about do you?

, Make VERY sure that the coast is clear, that is meaning your colleagues, boss and especially the gossips are NOT around, whether it's in the work premises or outside the work premises. (Danger - You never know who is watching or the risk of your boss/colleages/gossips seeing you two and you never know who might tell on you when you are not around do you?)

Treat her like a normal girl, that is, politely.,
Ask her out like you would to a normal girl.,
Do not embarrass her by trying to make her drink, smoke or do drugs.,
Do not kill insects in her presence.,
Attempt to be genuinely interested in her beliefs once in a while.,
Don't be a sleaze.,
Remember that she will approach things from a Buddhist viewpoint, which may be alien at times, especially to those of theist religions.

,
Read books on HER TRADITION of Buddhism to understand where she is coming from.,
If you are religious but not Buddhist, look for similarities and shared experiences to make the relationship stronger BECAUSE of this point- if you are both religious, you already share much common ground of ethics and morality.,
If you are not religious, she shares many common points with you, too, such as not worshipping a God or Gods and rejection of superstition and dogma.

,
Don't touch her shrine, her chanting beads, statuary, books, under any circumstances.,
Don't ever say anything bad about her Teacher, her Buddhist community, or monks or nuns unless it's really important to you.,
She may wake up very early in the morning and spend long hours chanting in a language you don't understand.,
Buddhists like to laugh about their spirituality.,
If incense is a problem for you because of allergies, asthma, etc., ask her to burn a smokeless variety or do without.

,
Every now and then she may get the inclination to go shave her head and be a nun.,
Do you think she spends too much time on a temple or monastery?","How to Have a Buddhist Girlfriend, but Be of Another Religion Yourself",";
, With one caveat. If you are eating out, be sure to ask her if she is vegetarian.

, Most Buddhists do not do these things. Buddhism teaches ""avoidance of Intoxicants"" so your Buddhist girlfriend may also avoid other foods, drinks or activities she identifies as intoxicating.

, Throw away the fly spray. In her eyes, if you kill insects you are a mass-murderer...and Buddhist girls do not tend to like mass-murderers. In general.

, This will make her happy. And you may learn something. Either way, the process is likely to deepen your relationship.

, Like any religious girl, chances are she has moral ideas about relationships, which may or may not prohibit pre-marital sex. Buddhism explicitly prohibits 'illicit sex'. How she interprets this will vary according to her culture, upbringing, tradition of Buddhism and personal beliefs.

,, Remember that not all Buddhists are the same, and just because you read it in a book doesn't mean it holds true for her. This could be especially true for culturally bound Buddhist etiquette and sect-specific observances. It is not polite to ask a Theravaden girl if she recites the Lotus Sutra, for instance. You certainly won't impress her by talking about Mahayana ideology if she is Theravadin.

, If you are Muslim, she agrees very much with giving zakat, or alms. If you are Hindu, Siddartha Gautama - the Buddha - was born to a Hindu family so Hinduism and Buddhism have much in common. For example, your girlfriend also wants to attain moksha (liberation). If you are Christian, 'treat others as you would yourself' and 'forgive your enemies' are her tenets, too. There is much more common ground than difference: both of you want to become better human beings.

,, She doesn't worship idols, but they have deep symbolism for her, and that needs to be respected.

, Chances are, she respects them.

, If you don't find this beautiful, don't date a Buddhist girl! She may also do this in the evening. This is to be expected.

, If you start to take her Buddhist practice seriously, she may well laugh at you.

,, Renunciation of worldly ties goes hand in hand with most styles of Buddhism. Let her.

, Handle it diplomatically. Somme examples: ""Why don't we study the Dharma together at home today?"" or ""You can learn Buddhism just as well from a walk in the park.""

Figure out how you define ""sexual immorality"" for yourself.,
Talk to your partner (if you have one) about their personal beliefs about sexual immorality.,
Set a list of sexual boundaries you both agree on.,
Communicate clearly.,
Have respect.,
If you are still having problems avoiding sexual immorality, maybe it's because you're in love.",How to Guard Yourself from Sexual Immorality," This may depend upon your own religion and philosophy and will be unique for each person. For example, many branches of Christianity define sexual immorality as copulation before marriage, but there also may be many steps before that to think about. Some people consider kissing before marriage to be wrong and others consider undressing in front of each other before marriage okay as long as you don't have sex. What you define ""sex"" to be will differ from what others define it as. Maybe you feel that only certain types of sex are immoral. You can't find specific guidelines through your religious text, although your religion and spiritual beliefs can guide you. Think about your ideal relationship and decide where you stand on the issues that are most important to you. Abstaining from immorality isn't just a religious idea either, and those without religious beliefs can feel that this is important as well.;
, Remember that what they think is okay might be slightly different than what you think is okay. You also might find out that you have different sexual histories, but what matters most is what you believe and are willing to do (or, rather, abstain from doing) currently, not what happened in the past.

, Be very specific. You may need to compromise if you have slightly different views. The most important thing is to communicate clearly and be consistent in enforcing the boundaries, holding each other accountable with the common goal of avoiding sexual immorality. These boundaries will not work unless you both are serious about sticking to them, so do not set boundaries you do not plan to actually follow.

, If one or both parties crosses a boundary, this should be talked about openly as soon as possible. Be encouraging rather than accusatory, having a common goal of avoiding sexual immorality. Make sure you both still agree on the boundaries. Strategize for how you will avoid the situation in the future. For example, you may try to avoid being home alone together after midnight. Set a new boundary and stick to it.


Religious people may want to pray or read your holy text together.

, Make sure you and/or your partner both respect the boundaries you have set for yourselves. If your partner consistently does not respect your boundaries, this may be a sign that they do not respect you as a person. Similarly, thinking of the people too much in sexual terms and not caring about getting to know them better may be a sign that you do not respect them. Mutual respect is very important in a relationship, but even outside of a relationship it is important to have respect and avoid objectifying people. Many instances of sexual immorality can be avoided simply by having respect for others.

, That's great! Still stick by your beliefs, but understand that having a desire for someone you love is not wrong, it's natural and good. If you have agreed to wait until marriage to have sex, you should still honor your agreement. It may become difficult, but you can do it. Don't give up. But if you are having significant difficulty with the issue of sexual immorality and it is interfering with your relationships, family, work, or daily life in a negative way, talking to a counselor would be a good option. There are many good counselors out there who specialize in sexual issues.

Take time to heal.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Follow instructions.,
Listen to your body.,
Rest up.",How to Have Great Sex After Having a Baby1," Your body goes through a lot giving birth. It is normal to take time to recover. Most caregivers recommend that you abstain from intercourse for at least 4 weeks after you give birth.It is unsafe to have intercourse less than 2 weeks after having a baby. Your body is likely still bleeding and you risk hemorrhaging or contracting an infection. 4 weeks is generally considered safer than 2 weeks.
If you have had stitches, your caregiver will likely advise you to wait until you have your 6 week postpartum check up.
A perineal tear, a c-section, or an episiotomy are all potential reasons that you might have stitches. These procedures all require extra healing time.;
, It is important to abstain from intercourse until after your doctor clears you for sex. Your healthcare provider might require you to come in for a check-up before giving you the all clear. Remember, this is to help your body recover.Your follow-up appointment is a great time to ask your doctor questions. You can ask about your recovery in general, but you can also have an honest conversation about post-baby sex.
Prepare a list of questions in advance. That way, you will be more likely to remember to ask about everything that has been on your mind.
You can ask questions such as, ""Are there any precautions that I need to take when having sex for the first time?"" and ""If there is discomfort, how can I ease that?""

, Maybe you've been looking forward to receiving the all-clear from your doctor to resume having sex. If he advises you to wait a while longer after your 6 week checkup, that can be disappointing. However, it is important that you follow any medical instructions that you receive after having a baby.If you had a c-section or perineal tearing, you may need additional time to heal. You can risk a setback and further wounding your body if you don't wait.
If your doctor says your body is ready for sex, that's great news. But listen to any other advice offered. For example, if you are told to take it slow and easy, do so. If lubricant is recommended, make sure to get some.

, You are the only one who knows for sure if you are ready to begin having sex again. Even if your doctor says you are physically ready, you may feel like you need more time. Many women are especially sensitive for several months after giving birth.Vaginal dryness is a common problem, especially if you are breastfeeding. You may continue to experience this for the duration of breastfeeding.
Lubricants can help. However, if you feel discomfort or pain, it is perfectly fine to hold off on having sex.
Pay attention to your body's needs. If the thought of having sex makes you anxious, that is probably a sign that you need to wait longer. And that's fine.

, When you have a new baby, your life revolves around feeding, changing, and caring for that infant. Both parents are likely suffering from a severe lack of sleep. It is no secret that your sex drive is negatively impacted by not getting enough rest.Before you will feel like having great sex again, you'll need to start getting more sleep. This might seem impossible, but it is important for your sex life.
However, the correlation between sex and sleep goes both ways. Having sex can actually help you sleep more restfully.
Even if you are exhausted, try having sex if you feel physically capable. The few hours of sleep you grab will feel more restful.
Once you start getting more sleep, you'll feel more motivated to have more sex. It is a cycle.
Try going to bed a half hour earlier. Make this a time specifically for sex.

Don’t let your partner guilt you into having sex.",How to Have Fun in Bed With Your Partner Without Sex," Does it mean everything but sexual intercourse? Does it mean kissing and cuddling, but nothing else? Having clearly defined boundaries will make it easier for you and your partner to hold off on having sex until you’re both ready., You might find it helpful to write these down on a piece of paper, in your journal, or in a text document on your computer. This is just for you, so don’t be afraid to be completely honest. Things to consider:


What would the perfect relationship be for you? Are you in it right now?
What do you love about your partner? Is he/she a kind person? Supportive? Funny? Smart? Physically fit?
Telling your partner what you like about him/her should help him/her understand your reasons for wanting to be in the relationship beyond sex; they should understand that it’s nothing personal — it’s not about them.

, Make the decision to talk about abstinence together before you’re aroused — preferably before you’ve become too physically intimate at all.


Clearly stating your boundaries early in the relationship may be daunting, but it will make things easier for you and your partner in the long run.

, How you discuss your boundaries will depend largely upon your age and experience: a discussion between 30 year olds will be much different from one between teens. Regardless of your demographic, be clear, direct, and respectful. As an example, here are some tips for talking to a teenaged boy or a young adult male:


A younger, less mature boy might have difficulty dealing with a serious conversation. It may be helpful to bring it up ahead of time with him — for example, “I want to talk to you about something kind of serious — it’s not bad though. Can we do that after school?”Make sure he’s not hungry or otherwise irritable before you talk to him.If you can, try to talk to him while you two are walking together. In general, guys think better when they are active.Walking as you talk will also make him feel less stressed or trapped than if you’re sitting still somewhere.
Don’t stare. Another good thing about walking while you talk is that you are looking straight ahead for the most part. Staring into your partner’s eyes while talking about something serious may be frightening for him; it may make things seem even more serious, which could cause him to shut down and stop communicating with you.Let him know you care.Make sure he knows how happy you are in the relationship and how much you like him.
You two are on the same team: make sure he knows this. You’re talking to him because you want him to know your wants and needs, and you are open to hearing his, too.

, If this is the first time you’ve brought up abstinence with your partner, he/she may be surprised. He/she may have a lot of questions: it's important that you both communicate in an open and considerate manner.


Do not be defensive if your partner has a lot of questions. He/she may just be trying to get a better understanding of where you’re coming from.
If you are in a healthy relationship, you should be able to discuss your thoughts, feelings, and needs with your partner without it turning into a fight. If your partner gets upset at you, try to stay calm. It may even be necessary to leave him/her alone and give him/her some time to process what you've said.

, Having a serious talk can be exhausting both physically and emotionally. Try not to let the talk go on for longer than an hour if possible. When you’re both exhausted, you’re more likely to say things you don't mean and to make decisions you regret.


If your discussion isn’t done but you’re both tired, make a date to continue the discussion later. You don’t even have to leave each other’s presence if you don't want to; you can just agree to put the discussion on hold until you both have more energy to return to it.

, It may take some time for your partner to process what you’ve talked about and come back to you with his/her own questions and answers. If he/she listens but doesn’t respond right away, don’t panic. He/she might just need some time to process what you’ve talked about.


Your partner could need anywhere from a few minutes to a few days, to even a few weeks, to think about what you’ve said. Give him/her the time he/she needs to process his/her feelings; don’t push him/her for a response when he/she isn’t ready to give you one.

, In a healthy relationship, you’ll be close with your partner for many reasons beyond having sex. You can build closeness and trust in the relationship by talking, listening, sharing, respecting each other’s ideas, and simply by hanging out/taking pleasure in each other’s company.If you partner tries to tell you that sex is the only way you can be close, you may want to consider whether the relationship is really what you want.

, It can be fun just to sit in bed with your partner and do non-sexual things. Playing a board game is a great way to cozy up with your partner in bed without it turning into something sexual.

, Sit next to each other fully clothed, propped up on pillows, and take turns reading to each other. You can even take turns choosing which book you read. How close you sit depends on your level of comfort.


If you’re worried about it turning sexual, try staying above the covers while sitting next to each other. You could also sit on opposite ends of the bed with only your feet touching.
You can read each other romantic stories for a sexy twist (and maybe to laugh at how cheesy they are).

, Sitting in bed, listen to an album. Go over the lyrics. Sit close to each other and enjoy the closeness of your partner’s body, but don’t go further than simply holding hands or cuddling up close.

, Write questionnaires out for each other or print some pre-made ones off the Internet (search “fun questions to ask your partner”). Sit on opposite sides of the bed, each with a clipboard, and fill out your answers, then pass them to each other once you’re done so you can read the responses.

, Cozy up in bed together with some snacks and lots of pillows, and watch a movie. If you're worried that it will turn into a make-out session, try placing some pillows between you and using separate blankets.


If being separated by pillows and blankets doesn’t work, it’s okay to say it isn't working and ask your partner if he/she is into doing something else that makes your urges easier to resist.

, Turn your bed into a fort. Add some funky lights and cool blankets. When it’s done, sit inside and watch a movie or tell spooky stories.

, Sitting close to your partner in bed, you might find it difficult to resist the urge to do more than just cuddle. If you find yourself thinking about going further than your pre-set boundaries, consider moving away from your partner or even suggesting that you two move to a different location.


If you’re worried about offending your partner by moving away from them, you could make up an excuse for wanting to move — for example, “My back hurts sitting here, let’s move over to the couch in the living room,” or “Hey I’m feeling a bit restless, let’s take a break and go for a walk!”
Getting out into public spaces will make it easier to resist acting on your sexual urges.

, If you do end up making out and you begin to feel bad about it, it’s okay to stop and say that you don’t feel comfortable continuing. Your partner should respect your wishes immediately.


If your partner repeatedly tries to convince you to go further than the boundaries you've set, you may want to consider whether he/she is worth continuing a relationship with.
While it's okay for your partner to check in with you now and then, he/she should never make you feel bad for your decision.

, You and your partner can be physically intimate without having sexual intercourse. If you're comfortable making out but you're not comfortable having sexual intercourse, then don’t have sexual intercourse. You don’t owe it to your partner.


Don’t let anyone else define your boundaries for you. Only do what you’re comfortable with.

, Hold hands, hug, or sit close to each other in bed. Enjoy touching and being close to one another without it having to go any further than that.

, Kiss each other, taking time to explore different ways of kissing. Do an online search for “how to kiss” and try out the different methods.


Don’t take yourselves too seriously. Laugh when the kisses feel awkward! You’re building intimacy by experimenting with what works and doesn't work.

, Using a scented oil or lotion, take turns massaging each other’s bodies. How much of each other’s bodies you massage depends on your boundaries: you can just massage one another’s necks and backs if you aren’t ready to go further than that.

, Setting rules will not only help you stick to your boundaries; it will also make things extra sexy. An example of a rule you might set is that neither of you can remove even one item of clothing. Another possible rule is no hands allowed below the waist.

, Touch and kiss the areas of your partner’s body that don’t usually get attention during sex — for example, his/her legs, stomach, or back. Take time to enjoy exploring your partner’s body; build a physical intimacy with your partner that doesn’t depend on sexual intercourse.

, You can do this to varying degrees. For example, you might agree not to touch each other, and then sit across from each other and slowly undress.


To take it up a notch, you could sit across from each other and touch yourselves, with the rule that you are not allowed to touch each other.

, This is a fun way for you and your partner to explore one another’s bodies without touching each other. Doing this allows you to slow down and appreciate every detail of your partner's body.

, Take photos of each other looking sexy in bed. You can make this as silly or as sexy as you want. Do an online search of “80s glamor shots” for inspiration.


A funny boudoir photoshoot would be to wear a fancy dress or suit and a feather boa, then make silly faces while posing on top of the bed.
If you have cats, you can incorporate them into the photo for added hilariousness.

, Make a date to have a sexy phone call or text messaging session while you’re both in bed. This could range from flirting to sending sexy photos of each other, to having a full phone sex session.


If you do send sexy photos to one another, exercise caution: anything you send to your partner could end up in someone else’s hands.
If you’re worried about someone else seeing you in a vulnerable position, either don’t take the photo, or keep your face out of it.

, Prepare yourself for the possibility that your partner will try to convince you to have sexual intercourse. Anticipate your partner’s possible responses so that they don’t catch you off guard.Knowing what you’ll say and how you’ll behave ahead of time will make it easier for you to clearly articulate yourself — especially if the topic arises while you’re aroused and potentially not thinking clearly., Periodically remind yourself of your reasons for choosing to abstain from sexual intercourse. You can write them down in a journal once a week or whenever you’re questioning your commitment to abstinence.


You can also think them to yourself when you’re aroused with your partner.
Strengthen your resolve by reading other people’s stories online, and by reading about reasons to be abstinent.,


Although sex is not something “dirty” that you should be ashamed of, it’s possible that you will feel regret if you have it before you are ready.
If you are unsure of whether you’re ready to have sex, it’s healthier for you to wait until you are sure.

, Just make sure that you don’t make this decision in the heat of the moment, while you’re making out.


If you have the feeling that you want to have sex in the heat of the moment, it may be time to pull away and do something else.
If you still want to have sex a few days later, when you’re clear-headed, you can revisit your decision.
You may even want to talk it over with a friend, a close relative, a counsellor, or a nurse.
If you do decide to have sex, be sure that you have protection, such as condoms or birth control. You can obtain condoms at drug stores and most grocery stores; for birth control, you will have to see your doctor or go to a family planning clinic.

, If you’re at a party and you’ve had a bit to drink, and your partner wants to go home together, you may be best declining the offer and going home alone. Alcohol can make you less inhibited and more likely to have sex.


Maybe you know that whenever you’re alone in your room with your partner, you end up making out and getting close to having sex. You might want to avoid this if you aren’t sure that you can continue to fight the urge to have sex., A good friend will support you in your goals. If you want to be abstinent, talk to a friend about it. If you have other friends who also want to remain abstinent, make a promise to check in with each other and help one another stay true to your goals.If you decide to confide in a friend about your relationship and your desire to remain abstinent, make sure that it’s a close friend who you trust — someone who you know will support you and keep your secrets.
You might also find it useful to join an online community. There are many online communities for people who are abstaining from sex. Do an online search for one that best suits your needs.

, In a healthy relationship, partners treat one another with love and respect. Being a caring, considerate partner is your only obligation to your partner. It is not your responsibility to have sex with your partner.


Physical intimacy is an important element of most romantic relationships, but that doesn’t mean that you have to jump into bed with your partner right away. You have every right to wait until it feels right for you, and your partner needs to respect this.
If you’ve previously had sexual intercourse but are now abstinent, your desire to abstain from sex is just as valid as it would be if you had never had sex before. Don’t let anyone try to convince you that you should have sex against your wishes simply because you’ve had it before.

Accept the changes.,
Acknowledge your hormones.,
Be patient.,
Practice self-care.,
Regain your confidence.",How to Have Great Sex After Having a Baby2," When you have a new baby, you are going through a lot of changes. These changes aren't just physical. Pay attention to the emotional shifts that are occurring, too. Your emotional well-being is important when you are reestablishing a sexual connection with your partner. Start by accepting the changes that have happened. For example, you may notice that your breasts feel and look much differently.
That's normal. Try not to let your feelings about your body impact your desire to have sex.
Another common worry is that your body will feel differently to your partner after you give birth. It's possible that it might.
Accept that your body has physically changed, and that sex will be different for both of you. But that does not mean that it is not still good.

, Pregnancy and giving birth greatly affect your hormones. Your hormones likely will not return to normal until you start menstruating again. For many women, this doesn't happen until for anywhere from 4-12 weeks after giving birth.When your hormones are out of balance, your sex drive can vary. Many women will feel ready to have sex, but just as many won't feel ready for several months.
Remember that feeling either way is fine. And it's normal for your feelings to shift from day to day, and even hour to hour.
You will also be spending most hours of the day holding and caring for your newborn. When it's finally time to take a break, you may feel the need for some personal space. It's ok if you don't feel like being touched.

, Try not to think too much about what other people do. Your sex life is between you and your partner. You two should resume having sex when it is right for you. Having a great sex life after a baby may take some adjustments, which is normal. The best thing you can do is to be patient with yourself and with your partner.Some couples begin having sex 1 month after giving birth. Others prefer to wait 6 months.

Be supportive.",How to Have Great Sex After Having a Baby3," The key to having great sex is to be open and honest with your partner. This is especially true after you have a baby. You have both experienced a major life change. This warrants a discussion about how your sex life will change.Share your feelings. If you are nervous about having sex, talk to your partner.
Try saying something like, ""I'm still experiencing a lot of tenderness. I am a little anxious about having sex.""
If your partner is the one who gave birth, you may have your own concerns. Try sharing by saying, ""I'm worried that I will hurt you or cause you pain during sex.""
Validate one another's emotions by listening. By talking to each other, you can connect and exhibit trust.

, If you are not ready to start having intercourse yet,that's ok. There are other ways that you can reestablish an intimate connection with your partner. Talk to one other about ways that appeal to you both.Give each other massages. Light some candles, get some scented oils, and help each other relax. You'll feel physically connected without the anxiety.
Take a shower together. Let the steam and scented soaps help you feel sexual with each other. You could also try a bubble bath.
Touch each other. Hold hands, cuddle during a movie, and kiss each other multiple times throughout the day.

, You may not be able to immediately resume your normal sexual preferences. For example, missionary position can feel uncomfortable to women who have recently given birth. Consider trying alternate positions so that you can both enjoy sex.During postpartum sex, it can be helpful to let the woman control the pace and pressure.
Try a woman on top position. This way, the female can set the tone during sex.
Side-by-side can also be a great way to make sex feel good to both of you. This position typically causes penetration to be less deep, which can be helpful for someone who is healing.
Communicate during sex. Tell your partner what feels good and what doesn't.

, Life after having a baby can be very hectic. You are likely both sleeping much less and a bit stressed from additional responsibility. Try to make time for your relationship, despite the challenges.Go on a date night. Ask a family member to come over. Take some time for an adult dinner and movie out of the house.
If a sitter isn't feasible, have a date night at home. When the baby is sleeping, take some time to cuddle on the couch and catch up on your Netflix shows.
Take time to focus on your relationship outside of parenthood. On your dates, make sure to talk about something other than the baby.
Talk to each other about outside interests. When you're a new parent, it's natural to focus on sleep schedules and breastfeeding, but don't forget that you and your partner are attracted to each other for other reasons.

, Sex is an important part of a healthy relationship. Sometimes you need to put in some extra effort to make sure that you devote enough time to that component of your relationship. If you find that you're not having enough sex, try scheduling it.Make a sex date. You can work this into your schedule the same way that you plan things like doctors appointments and paying the bills.
This may not seem totally romantic, but it is worth it. Once you get in the habit of having regular sex again, you will no longer need to plan it in advance.
You may schedule the act itself, but that doesn't mean that your lovemaking has to be routine. Surprise each other by trying some new moves.
It's okay to be flexible. You'll have to work around your baby's schedule. But make sure to keep your sex date, even if it has to be pushed back or moved forward. If necessary, skip the housework for once.

, The most important thing you can do to encourage great sex is to be emotionally supportive of one another. Being a new parent is an amazing experience, but it definitely comes with challenges. Make sure that you and your partner help each other out.Encourage one another. Say things like, ""You're a great mom. And that makes me love you even more.""
You will likely find that parenthood deepens your connection. Which is an excellent way to help your sex life be fantastic.

Never stop giving affection.",How to Give Affection," What type of affection do they need at the moment?This is all extremely important. What can I do to show affection in the right way? Certain people need certain levels of affections, and it all depends.For example the affection you will give to your husband or your wife, would not be the same to a work partner.;
, Sometimes we have this tendency to immediately judge people when they make a mistake. To be affectionate, this must stop. Whenever someone makes a mistake, or is a failure at something you should be empathetic and put yourself in their shoes. Why did they make that mistake? Instead of accusing them orientate them on how to not make that mistake next them. Develop a habit of looking at people in an understanding way.

, Whenever you hear some ""hot' gossip, which will only bring a piece of negative information you should, place it straight away in the freezer and cool it down. Whenever you send an email, or write something on Facebook etc try to write only inspiring message which uplift people. Nobody likes people which just know how to badmouth.

, As long as they are sincere of course. Whenever you share a compliment, you show to other people that you notify the good in other people and this will also show that you are happy to yourself. This is because people who aren't fine with themselves usually mock at other people to make themselves feel better. Whenever you give a compliment, you will not only lift up their self-esteem, you will feel good too. In turn when someone gives you a compliment, return a comment graciously and with a compliment too.

, If they are sad, be sad with them and if they are happy be cheerful among with them. Sometimes during a conversation you don't always need a word of advice on hand, but you should always have an ear to listen and this may be hard for some of us. If you have an ear to listen, people will come to you whenever they need affection.

, Even if you don't like it. Of course, this doesn't mean you should do idiotic acts such as smoke and drink only because someone is asking you to. This is wrong. However if your partner is watching his favorite football match, watch it with him. If your friend is taking up ballet and is feeling shy, take it with her at least for a while until they begin to start building confidence. You may have the gracefulness of a bull in a china shop but sometimes we have to get out of our comfort zone to show affection.

, Would you like your mom to make your bed and do your laundry, why don't you do hers? This will surprise your mom and make her extremely happy. Why not join her for a day doing all the chores together? This way you will see, how exhausting it can be to provide for the family. This is of course an example and you should apply this type of affection to your situation.

, Go to the retirement homes and paint ladies nails and do their hair. Tell stories and join them in activities such as knitting. Go to your dog rescue centre and help taking care of animals such as dogs and cats. This is a very good way of showing affection.

, Kissing actually creates a closer bond with your partner and at times decrease pain, you feel closer and this will be an act of affection.

, This isn't something you should do once or twice but should practice daily for the rest of your lives. People will soon see you as an admirable person, and remember: being affectionate is not being the latest AGONY AUNT on the block stroking everyone crying, it is someone who knows how to have fun and knows what to do when someone else is in a difficult situation!

Play hard to get.",How to Get Your Girl Friend to Love You More," If you want to get your girlfriend's attention, then you have to make her see that you really do care about her. While superficial compliments about her appearance or compliments that are only calculated to make her like you won't get you very far, giving her a meaningful compliment at the right time can show her that you really care. If you're worried about getting her to love you more, then chances are it's because she's not feeling the love back, so let her know you care by telling her what makes her so special.


You can compliment an impressive aspect of her personality. You can say something like, ""It's really awesome that you can strike up a conversation with almost anyone. How do you do that?"" Or, ""You're such a hard worker. I wish I could study for as long as you could.""
You should pay attention to her and notice when she's wearing something new or when she got a new haircut. Say, ""I love that new sweater on you. It really brings out your eyes,"" and she'll be impressed that you're paying attention.;
, Another way to make your girlfriend feel special and to win her over is to do some favors for her to show her you care. This could mean bringing her lunch when she's had a busy day, giving her a ride when she needs it, or helping her clean up her place after a party. Just taking the time to make her life a little easier will make her appreciate you more. Of course, you don't want to be her puppy dog and make her think she can take advantage of you, but you should help her out when you can, provided she does the same for you.


She may protest when you ask her if she needs help, but if you see that she really does need some help from you, you should help her out as much as you can.

, If you want to make your girlfriend feel special, then you can't just treat her like arm candy. You have to care about the things she cares about and want her to succeed. If she's really into soccer, you should go to her games when you can. If she's trying to find a new job, you can help her by setting up a mock interview. Let her see that you want her to do well and care about the things that matter to her, and she'll be touched by how thoughtful you are.


If she's upset, you should be there to comfort her and to talk about it when she's ready to talk. Don't get frustrated with her when she's not in a good mood because she's had a personal disappointment.
Cheer her on if she has a big day coming up. Wish her luck and tell her you'll be thinking of her.

, You don't want your girlfriend to get bored or to think you don't really care about her. As you open up to each other, you should ask her questions about her life, from asking about her childhood to her relationships with her friends and parents. You should also ask her about her goals for the future or about what she has coming up in the week. Show her that you care about who she is as a person and about how she's growing.


Let her see that you're genuinely interested in who she is, and that you're not just asking to sound polite. Make eye contact and really give your full attention when she tells you about herself.
Ask her to talk more about her hobbies and interests, even if you don't really know a lot about them.

, If you want her to see that you care, then you should check in with her at least once a day, whether you call or text her, to see how her day is going. Make her see that when you're not together, she's still on your mind, and she'll be touched. You can check in after you know she's had something important happen, whether it's a major exam or a soccer game. Let her see that you care about her even when you're miles apart.


Of course, you shouldn't get obsessive and check in with her every five minutes, or that will be a major turn-off. And if she's out with her girlfriends, give her a break instead of checking in every chance you get, or she'll think that you're jealous and possessive.

, It's true that most guys don't love holding hands or major PDA. But that doesn't mean you can't show her some love and affection when you're together, whether you're putting your arm around her, stroking her hair, or putting a hand on her arm or knee when you're talking. Just a bit of physical affection can go a long way, showing her that you really like being around her. You may see that she's being distant because she feels like you don't care enough, and giving her some affection is a great way to change that.


You don't have to hold hands all the time, but holding her hand every once in a while is a great way to let her know you care. If you're at the movies, give her hand a squeeze once or twice.
You don't have to kiss in public, but giving her a kiss when you see her and when you say goodbye will make her see that you care.

, Most people could stand to brush up on their listening skills, and many boys aren't exactly known for being amazing listeners. The next time she talks to you, you should really absorb every word, put away all distractions, and look into her eyes. Don't interrupt her or try to solve her problems, and work on simply being there for her and taking the time to understand what she's telling you. This will make her see that you really do care about her.


Once she's done talking, ask her more questions to see how she's feeling. If she's asking for advice, make sure you have all the facts before you give it to her.
Put away your phone when she's trying to tell you something. You'll drive her crazy if you keep checking your phone when she's trying to have an important conversation.

, If you want to be a better boyfriend to your girlfriend, then you have to work on being more of a gentleman. This doesn't mean you have to turn into Cary Grant or pick her up in a horse-drawn carriage, but it does mean that you should try to treat her with a bit more attention and respect. Open doors for her, whether she's getting into your car or walking into a restaurant. Pull out her chair before she sits down. Give her your coat if she's cold and avoid being overly vulgar in her presence.


Don't worry: being a gentleman doesn't mean acting phony or over the top. Just treating your girlfriend with more care and attention will make her see that you're a true gentleman.

, Many boyfriends are notoriously bad at communicating their needs. If you want to be a better boyfriend, then you have to work on being able to honestly but kindly tell your girlfriend what you're feeling, how to have a conversation without getting angry, and how to learn to compromise instead of being upset when you don't get what you want. If you develop stronger communication skills, your relationship will flourish.


When your girlfriend is upset, you should work on understanding what she's really angry about and try to address her concerns; if she's mad at you for being late for a date, for example, it may mean that she's mad because she feels like you don't put enough effort into the relationship.
Timing is also important if you want to have a serious conversation. If you want to have a big talk with your girlfriend, try to pick a time when she won't be too tired or distracted to have the conversation.

, If you want to be a better boyfriend, then you have to make yourself more available to your girlfriend. This doesn't mean you should be free 24/7 and have to bend to her will at any given moment, but it does mean that you should make enough time to keep your relationship going strong, from time to weekly date nights to time to talk on the phone or watch a movie with her. If you're never around or always prefer hanging out with your buddies instead of her, she's likely to feel neglected.


That said, it could be possible that she's losing that loving feeling because you're starting to feel too dependable, like you're always around. Make sure that you continue to have your own life, your solo time with your friends, and time to pursue your own hobbies and interests. Though you want to make time for her, you also want her to see that you're an interesting and dynamic person.

, While making time for your girlfriend is important, so is respecting her own time and space. Let her hang out with her girlfriends without being jealous or calling her every five minutes; avoid trying to do every single thing she likes, from running to volunteering, right along with her. Let her do her own thing and applaud her for it while knowing when she wants you to come along. You don't want her to feel smothered or like you don't like it when she takes two steps away from you.


If you smother her, she'll feel like you don't trust her or have faith in the relationship. If you're comfortable enough to let her do her own thing or hang out with her friends, then she'll feel like you're confident with who you are what you two have.

, Her friends and family are important, and may be the key to her heart. Don't just brush them off or make superficial small talk without taking the time to really get to know them. Ask them how they are, share something about yourself, and show that you really care about them. Even if you're only doing it because you care about your girlfriend, it'll make a big difference, and they'll be more likely to sing your high praises when she talks about you.


If your girlfriend invites you to hang out with her friends, you should accept from time to time, even if you don't have the greatest time ever. This will show her that you really do care and are making an effort.

, If you want to keep your love going strong, then you have to find new interests to pursue together. This could be watching every Hitchcock movie ever made, taking tennis lessons together, or getting into hiking. Whatever it is, you should find something that just the two of you can do together and which reminds you of your relationship. If you just keep on doing the same old things, the excitement is bound to fade.


You can take a hip hop, karate, or art class together, if that's your thing. Of course, you shouldn't have to do anything you don't want to do.

, Though dinner and a movie is nice every once in a while, you should try to keep things exciting by mixing it up once in a while. Instead of going out to dinner, invite your girlfriend over and cook for her. Instead of seeing a movie, take a sunset hike and have a picnic. Have a date night on a random Tuesday instead of on the same old Friday night, just to get your blood flowing.


Set up an appointment to rock climbing at a gym. Take a kickboxing class together. Doing a form of exercise together can be very sexy.

, Though spending time together is the best way to keep your relationship going strong, if your girlfriend is the only person you hang out with, things are bound to go south. Hang out with a group of mutual friends, each other's friends, or family from time to time, or even make an effort to make new friends together, so you never run out of things to do and always keep your relationship feeling fresh.


Hanging out in groups as well as alone can help you appreciate each other on a whole new level. Even going on double dates can add a fun new layer to your relationship.

, Though it's great to plan a new thing to do together or to plan an exciting date night, there's something to be said for being spontaneous, too. If you're driving by a new restaurant that looks cool, you should stop by and see if they have an open table. If you're suddenly bored on a Saturday afternoon, go on a road trip or drive to the beach without planning every second of the day. Just having the option to up and run and do something completely unexpected can keep your relationship exciting.


Is there something that you and your girlfriend have always said you've wanted to do, but you haven't had the chance to try it? What better time than now?

, Though it's important to show your girlfriend how much you care and to be open and honest with her, you shouldn't put all of your cards on the table unless you want her to get complacent. Don't pick up the phone the second she calls, have other plans in your social calendar, and don't smother her with your love while letting her know that you care. If you play hard to get and leave her to chase you, she'll be much more interested than if she knows she has you wrapped around her little finger.


If she doesn't think you're 100% available whenever she wants to hang out with you, she'll cherish your time together more.

Spoil her.",How to Get Your Girlfriend to Kiss or Hug You More Often," The idea is that if you show her affection, she'll show you affection back. Do this regularly enough, but don't smother her (see Step #2). Try the following ideas for guidance:


When walking in the mall, hold her hand, or hold her hand in the movies.
When you greet her, give her a kiss. If she doesn't know you're there, come up gently behind her and kiss her neck.
Snuggle next to her on the couch, with your arm around her, and your fingers in her hair.
Offer to give her a back, hand or foot massage. Girls love to be pampered.;
, If your girlfriend tells you that you're too clingy, or she's not really the affectionate type, learn to find a balance between what affection you want to show and what she thinks is reasonable.


If she thinks you're too clingy, showing affection to you is the last thing on her mind. She gets annoyed by some of the affection you show, and thinks that some of it is unnecessary.
Learn to back off a little bit. If you can, respect her feelings and back off a little. Don't stop showing affection completely, but slow down with the kisses and hugs, and focus on putting more emotion into the ones you do give her.

, Don't be dishonest or prepare a script of what to say; just say what about her makes you happy, what about her makes you lucky, what about her makes you want to have her by your side.


If she's wearing a pretty dress, say something like: ""What a nice dress. It fits you perfectly. Summer, here you come!""
If you notice she's gotten her hair cut recently, react to it: ""Did you get a haircut? It makes me notice how pretty you are. Not that I normally forget....""
If she accomplishes something smart/hard/grueling, tell her you respect her: ""I'm proud of you. I knew that you were smart/tough/dedicated, but you keep showing me parts of you.""
Simple compliments work best. ""You have beautiful eyes,"" or ""When you smile, I light up inside"" are always winners. When you compliment a girl, remember these tips:

Don't compliment her breasts or butt. Stick with compliments about her eyes, hair, smile, or clothes.
Avoid the cheesy stuff. ""You're the sweetest thing I ever tasted, sugar muffin"" is cheesy (well, sugary, at least!), but ""I'm lucky to have you"" is less so.
Deliver your compliments with a smile, in a sweet tone. Act like you mean it. It's often not what you say, but how you say it.



, Make her want to be around you. Be in a good mood, don't complain to her about all the little things that bother you, and be interested in the life around you. If you're a lovable guy, she'll feel like she can never show you enough affection.


Be easy to be around. Surround yourself with happy people, do fun things, and don't worry so much about every little thing! Girls love guys who take things easy.

, Girls are attracted to guys who know how to have fun. This means that you should get in the habit of genuinely having fun around her.


Be silly together. Do impressions of celebrities, or playact scenes you experienced together that day or challenge authority in an intelligent way. Do whatever gets her in a playful mood with you.
Play harmless practical jokes. If she doesn't like jokes, then ease up on her, or play a joke on someone else together.
Tell jokes. Find jokes online, or develop your own list. Even better, make some inside jokes that only you two will understand. The bottom line is that if you make her laugh, she'll want to show you more affection.

, This includes washing your clothes, brushing your teeth, flossing and using mouthwash. (No one wants to share a smelly mouth.) Wear a pleasant scent cologne or after-shave. She'll enjoy having your cheeks next to hers. Many women find certain scents to be annoying, so stop wearing it if she complains.


When you wear a scent, be sure it's not too much; women hate it when guys feel the need to wear a lot of cologne. Guys often put too much on.
Wash your hair regularly and let her play with it. Girls like playing with their boyfriends' hair. Give her an excuse to go through your soft, clean locks.
Make your best effort to look clean and put together. Even if you're going for a grungy look, you can still look put together. Girls can tell when you don't care about your looks.

, When you go to meet her, bring her something one time. It doesn't have to be anything big, it could be a candy bar or a funny card. It's a nice gesture to show that you are interested in her and want to please her.


Try bringing her lunch or dinner out of the blue. If she doesn't expect it, all the better. Figure out what she likes and eat it with her.
Write her a nice letter once in a while. Handwritten is best. It doesn't have to be long or mushy. Tell her you think about her all the time; tell her why she's special to you.
Pick up something she wants. Girls will often drop hints about what they like, like musical artists, clothing items, or accessories. Remember what she likes, and go out and get her something reasonable. She'll be stunned.

, Special dates are great because they are exciting. She doesn't know what's happening, and then you come and sweep her off her feet. If that's not a recipe for hugs and kisses, a recipe doesn't exist!


Plan a movie-date, a dinner-date, or an activity (such as bowling, ice-skating, cooking classes, or a sports game). If she's really interested in something, try to fit that into the date.
Get her friends to help you. Try planning a surprise birthday party with her friends or with her family if you're close to them.

, Do not wait for her to do it first, or wait on principle. Be the kind of person you know she'll respect. Remember, if you wouldn't want her doing it to you, don't do it to her.

, Make her feel as if she is the only girl on earth who means something to you. This will make her comfortable, relaxed, and happy. When she's spoiled, chances are she'll show you how spoiled you make her feel.


Small things, like opening the door, or asking for her opinion, often go overlooked by guys. Be a gentleman.
If you know she's having trouble with something, like a homework problem, a long grocery list, or a CD she can't find, help her out. Show her that you think about her even when you're apart.
Be there for her when she's sick. Bring her warm soup and soda, along with some movies you can watch together.
Never forget the flowers. Every moment is practically an opportunity to get her flowers. Don't go overboard, but get her flowers she loves from time to time. You can even pick flowers for her if you're close to nature. Flowers are a great way to get her to kiss or hug you.

Keep a life out of your partner.",How to Have a Great Love Life," Of course, there is more to someone than the way he or she looks. Dating is often made of first impressions, though so be sure the one you'll give is good. No need to become a model - just keep your general appearance clean, nice and attractive.


Have good hygiene. Showering everyday, washing your hair as often as needed, and brushing your teeth regularly are basic rules. You could also go further and change your looks a little. A brand new haircut is always popular to make a fresh start. For girls, you could try another way to make up, or have your hands done at a beauty parlor. Be sure to enjoy the change, though, or else you'll regret it!
Adopt healthy habits. Sleep as many hours a night as you need, enjoy the day's sunshine, exercise regularly, eat consistent and nutritious meals...You know the list. Not only will this make you look fitter (and thus more attractive); it will also give you a healthier constitution-which means more stamina, which is not something to overlook if you plan on going out, and being a dynamic person to date!
Take a good look at your wardrobe. Do you like what you see? Are you tired of your regular clothes ? You could consider buying some items you don't possess (for instance if you're short of trendy evening clothes) or even changing your style a bit.. or, why not, a lot.

Again, don't feel forced to do that: you starting off a dating life does not necessarily mean you have to make a complete break in your life. Your clothes should make you happy and comfortable. Still, be sure you have some pieces of clothing that really suit your appearance and personality, and that will look good on special occasions. For instance, a classy shirt, becoming blue-jeans, colorful sweater, little black dress...Don't hesitate to ask a good friend for advice!

;
, Expectations vary with people. Before entering the dating scene, you have to determine what you're looking for there.


Do you want a serious relationship, or just a casual one? Would you be okay with having a friend with benefits, or one night stands? In short, you should check what a ""great love life"" is in your opinion. It will help when you actually meet people. For instance, dating a casual person could be considered as a loss of time if you're looking for a committed relationship. If you're not, it could be a lot of fun!

, Determine what your expectations are, but don't consider them as an absolute rule! Things that you want now can change after a few years.


The person you dismiss may have potential as a love interest. Keep open to new possibilities and new people. It does not mean you have to give anybody a chance just for the sake of giving it. However, someone who seems bland or shallow on the telephone/during the first encounter could loosen up during an extended conversation over coffee or drinks - and turn out to be just shy or caught at a bad time!

, A popular belief is that to be happy as a lover you first have to be happy as a single person. It may not always be true- or sad people would never find love, but that's still a wise idea. What's the point of wasting your life until you find somebody to love-or even to date ? You'll just make yourself sadder. It is perfectly normal to feel blue if you're lonely. But don't let that stop you from having fun!


Happy and content people are much more attractive to meet! Spend time with your friends, exercise, indulge in hobbies and passions...live it up! Take advantage of your independence, too. You'll never be more free than you are right now. Now is the time to go abroad, form a music band, write a novel, try new things, put some wildness in your life..Remember that an interested person is always an interesting one as well, and it's not just because you're single and looking you shouldn't have the time of your life!

, Society can be hard on single people. If most of the people you know are in relationships, you may wonder if the problem's not with you. But don't. As long as you're decently clean, reasonably nice and not inapproachable, there's no reason you couldn't have a love life of your own.


Remember that love and dating are mostly made of chance encounters, even on the dating websites. Get rid of all the self-deprecatory thinking and talking: once you put yourself down, others are likely to do so as well. Dismiss all negative comments on your single status, either from your acquaintances or from yourself.

For instance, if you're self-conscious about your appearance, keep in mind this is roughly everybody's case. Try to describe yourself objectively or ask a trustworthy friend to do so. You'll find out you have beautiful traits, just like everyone else.


If you still can't get over the idea that lovable people must be perfect and you're not, visualize the persons you know who are in a happy relationship right now, or the couples you see walking down the street. Are they all gorgeous looking, or incredibly brainy ? Chance is, they're as imperfect as you-and maybe more so !

, If you've been single for awhile, you've probably already been told that by going out you will be more likely to meet new people than by staying home watching TV (which, of course, is true). Still, living by that rule can be a bit demoralizing in time, when you force yourself out of the house and come back alone and/or disinterested. So keep these two principles in mind:


Don't go out every single day of the year if you don't feel like it! No need to exhaust yourself. Make compromises: go out a few times a week, or at least once a week and take advantage of the evenings 'off' to relax, go to sleep earlier, spend some quiet time with friends or relatives...You will be in much better shape on the times you do go out...and you'll feel much more happy and impatient to do so!
Don't go out just for the sake of meeting someone. That's the easiest way to be dissuaded to go on. Of course, your chance of clicking with somebody will always be at the back of your head-and it should be, but don't make it a priority! Only go out because you enjoy it. Go to see movies or exhibitions you're interested in, attend lectures at libraries/museums/local universities, have a drink at your favorite bar, go dancing...the list is endless. However, be sure that should you not meet a potential mate, you'll still enjoy the time out! Who knows what may happen...

, Then, you can actually stay in and meet people!


Once in a while through the year, throw a small party at your place. It doesn't have to be for a special occasion. It may not even be very expensive, if you ask each of your guests to bring something for the buffet.
Of course, you may invite your closest friends but in order to get acquainted with new ones, don't hesitate to ask persons you don't know so well to come along-like a new colleague, or a neighbour. If you don't know many people, ask your friends to bring friends of their own and take advantage of the party to get to know them too!

, The next time your colleagues/schoolmates propose a going-out, or a person you like but are not crazy about asks you out for a drink, take a deep breath before refusing to come along. Do you really have something more important to do? If the answer is no, just go for it. True, you may not appreciate it. And you may have a great time!


Anyway, keep in mind accepting invitations is a great way to remain in that 'going out' mood. It's easier than planning something on your own, and it's more motivating as you will be surrounded by people you already know. Besides, it will establish you as a social, dynamic person and you'll be very likely to get asked out again!

, Some people claim that flirting in real life is outdated. Others that you hardly ever meet the right person on dating websites. Then, there are those who say dating in the office/class is a definite 'no'-because of gossips and everyone knowing. What about the ones who tried the gym/theatre club and declared it a dead area? You may then begin to wonder where people actually meet.


The thing is there are no right or wrong places to meet someone- there only are right and wrong persons for you. If you click with somebody, no matter if you are in the subway, a concert intermission, a coffee shop's queue, a public library with a sign 'silent please', or a dating website! On the other hand, you could go to that fantastic bar in which your best friend has met his/her current lover and come home without a telephone number. So, keep your eyes and mind opened!

, Everybody has a social network-friends, relatives, colleagues, old school mates, neighbours...Of course, some are broader. If you moved to a new town, and have no acquaintances there, it can take a little time to establish connections! The good thing about a network though is it's like a cobweb: it keeps spreading!


Don't hesitate to take advantage of your connections in order to meet new people. You can frankly announce to your friends you're looking for someone-they may have a great cousin to introduce you to. Otherwise, use your social gatherings to broaden your circle of acquaintances- family events, college/high school reunions, cocktail parties could be good occasions for that!

, If you have had your life organized around settled people-family, married friends, children... it can be tempting and comfortable to live at their pace and neglect your dating life. Of course, friends are precious and you should not give up on the cozy and warm times you spend together. However, remember to keep time and space for your love life. Schedule some nights out for you during the week and keep to them.


If you have children, try to have them babysit once in a while and enjoy the free time! If most of your friends are in relationships, try to befriend other bachelors-you can share experiences, advices and feelings.

, Now that you're an active dating person, you should not overlook the risks the game implies! Be sure to adopt the right habits from the start.


Exchanging phone numbers is one of dating most basic customs . If you meet someone and you both click, what's wrong about giving your number? Still, when it's a person you really don't know, or if you're unsure whether you actually want to see him/her again, you may find safer to accept the person's number and not give yours.

Say you'll call them later or send them a message and take some time to think it over. If you're bothered by someone who has your phone number and just won't leave you alone, take a look at your phone options: there is often a way to reject unwanted calls. If there isn't and the person's attitude creeps you out, you may consider changing your phone number!


If you decide to meet someone you've come across on a website dating, be sure it doesn't happen in a secluded place. Opt for a public square or a lively coffee shop, for instance. You may also want to phone the person some time before the encounter, if you've only communicated through e-mails and such. Hearing his/her voice will prepare you gradually for a meeting in real life!
Preservatives are another area you should be concerned about. Protecting yourself from STD and/or unwanted pregnancy is an essential path to a happy, safe and relaxed sex life. If you have interrogations about the different ways to protect yourself, consult specialized websites. Even if you're not sexually active right now, be sure to have condoms at home. You may also take some just in case on dates that could end in a bed. One is never too careful!

, OK, now you're out and you know the score, so what happens? Now you have to get familiar with the oldest dating habit: communication. Indeed, should you be surrounded by twenty eligible bachelors every day of the week, if you don't attempt to make conversation with any of them, your dating life will just stand still.


Get rid of your shyness and apprehensions and start talking. It's not as difficult as it seems and will go easier and easier over time. Introduce yourself. Ask questions. Enquire about the person's activities, hobbies...and so on. Parties are the perfect place to communicate with strangers as you both know the host and can talk about how you came to know him/her as well as your own paths in life.
If flirting makes you uneasy, persuade yourself you're not looking for a love interest, but simply, a new acquaintance- then see where it leads you to! Otherwise, if you feel attracted by the person, let it show!

Use some simple, friendly signals: smile, make eye contact, laugh at his/her jokes (but do it genuinely), express your interest...Then, when you get to know the person better, you may employ physical contact: kiss him/her on the cheek when you part, or gently shake hands, pat him/her on the arm or the shoulder to make a point...Don't be too invading though: some people are touchy, specially with strangers! Verbal flirting will come naturally to you if you're attracted, and specially if you feel the feeling is mutual! Just keep this attraction in the back of your head: it will come out, in subtle touches, in the course of your conversation. Again, don't make too blunt statements if you're unsure of the person-or of yourself!



, As you go through the dating process, it's likely you'll meet some people who just won't be right for you. You may feel hurt over someone's neglecting to call you back, be offended by a date's behaviour, or frustrated by a relationship that never seems to get started. Remember these are not the only dates you'll get: so do yourself a favor, and forget about them.


Erase their name from your notebook and phone contacts and keep them out of your mind. Of course, it's easier said than done. But it's also much simpler when you have places to go to, and new love interests to meet. Still, you can decide to give someone a second chance: you're the only judge of that. Evaluate their potential as well as your own interest-which may have changed over time.

, A date often pops up unexpectedly. And suddenly, you're being asked where you would like to meet the following evening. To avoid having to answer ""I don't know"" or to choose the spot in a hurry, be ahead of your time, and start looking before the invitations come crawling at your door!


Take a look at your town's opportunities and make a list of the best places. Where are the not-so-expensive but delightful little restaurants? And the romantic parks? And the atmospheric bars and cafés? Help yourself in your search with magazines, or tourist guides. Note all the means of transport, and figure out the kind of people who are likely to love these spots.

, If you haven't done it in a while or are inexperienced, you may feel nervous and apprehensive about making love. It is quite natural. Still, keep in mind the more relaxed and spontaneous you are about sex, the more pleasure you'll get and give!


Start by becoming comfortable about your own body. Enjoy the simple sensuality of a fresh breeze, the touch of warm water, the softness of your bed...and so on. Indulge in some self-love. If you feel the need, don't hesitate waiting before having sex: there's no rush. And remember a happy sex life means knowing your partner- so open up and communicate - and most of all, know yourself.

, On the first weeks/months of your life on the dating scene, you may experience disappointment and feel that nothing's turning to concrete. But be patient ! Finding a mate/lover/date takes time. Don't give up on your social activities, and keep going out and meeting new people. Once you'll find someone you like, be sure there'll be another someone, and another one after that ! It's the spillover effect of socializing. The very start is not easy. But after you're done with it-enjoy yourself ! Not only will you possess a notebook full of new acquaintances, friends or love interests, you will also become more and more carefree, self-confident and happy about dating- and thus, more and more of an attractive person to date !

, Mutual respect should be the foundation of each relationship you're starting, whether it is casual or more committed. Love and passion are beautiful things: but keep away from love devoid of respect. It is dangerous and can become creepy: or at least, pretty unnerving !


Stay on your guards if your love interest ever treats you with meanness, rudeness or despise. Refuse insulting terms, hurting laughs, or dismisses of your freedom- even if they're only occasional. When a date gets really bad, make up some excuse and go away. Never stay in a relationship that brings you more sadness than joy. You don't have to put up with any condescending or violent treatment. Ask your friends, family -or even the police !- for help, if needed. Still, keep in mind respect does not mean complete devotion or putting someone on a pedestal. Gentle laughs and good-humoured teasing are a show of familiarity, but not an offensive one. Quarrels and arguments happen in the most loving relationships. So don't go to the other extreme and become paranoid or exacting with your partner.
On the other hand, be sure to behave respectfully with your love interests. If you have no interest in seeing someone again, be distant but still polite. Remember to thank the person after a date invitation and ask for news from your social circle now and then. Don't get angry over little things, for instance somebody's showing off a little late. If you disagree with a person's point of view, express your own opinions in a calm and firm manner. Keep in mind laughing and joking are great ways to bond with someone but that mocking is not. Once you get to know a person better, be a considerate lover. Propose a lift, show interest, give a small present once in a while, cheer him/her up after a bad day, lend an attentive ear, give spontaneous hugs...and so on. Of course, don't overdo it ! Don't become excessively devoted or intrusive. You can respect and love a person and still say no to him/her once in a while.

, Don't pay attention to the 'norms'. If you feel like going steady after two weeks of dating and so does your mate, who cares if magazines say it 'usually' takes several months ? On the other hand, if you should need more time to adapt to the idea of living with someone or go slow, just do it ! But be careful to let the communication line open, so your partner knows where you stand for and that you taking some time does not mean you don't care !

, Now that you've found your mate and life's looking wonderful- just one last piece of advice ! Don't forget to keep some private space in your life. The idea is not to make your partner feel excluded or jealous, of course ! But because, as tempting as it seems, center your whole life exclusively around one person may become pretty suffocating in time, and for both of you.


Keep in touch with your old friends, your old hobbies and allow yourself to discover new passions and interests ! You'll have plenty of things to tell your mate when you see each other and he/she may use the time off to connect with his/her own secret garden. Still, this doesn't mean you can't do things in common-quite the contrary ! But be sure to find a good balance, so being together remains a treat.

Engage in complementary expression of love.",How to Get Your Husband to Be Romantic," If you want your husband to treat you a certain way, let him know. He may not know your desires and therefore, may be unable to meet your wants or needs.Don’t expect your husband to “know” your wants or act as if he is a mind reader. Instead, do him (and you) a favor and clue him in.


Don’t be shy in expressing your desires. If there’s a gesture or action you appreciate, let him know.;
, If you like when your husband does something (like wash the dishes or open the door for you), make sure you let him know how much you appreciate the gesture.By letting him know you appreciate the gesture, he can begin to do these things continually out of love for you.


Say, “thank you” often, or express specific gratitude by saying, “I really appreciate when you pull my chair out for me.”

, Taking the lead is an excellent way for you to show your husband what you want and appreciate from him. Show your husband some romantic gestures like leaving a gift for him in the morning, planning a romantic evening together, or treating him to a massage. Show your husband your love and care for him by extending the romance to him.

When taking the lead, express your desire for your husband to reciprocate the romance back.

Take the lead in small gestures and also in sex. Do things that your husband finds romantic.
Taking the lead does not necessarily mean that your gestures will be returned. Your husband’s idea of romance may differ than your own.

, Intimacy doesn’t just include sex, it also includes being emotionally intimate.Encourage your husband to share his hopes, dreams, disappointments, fears, and accomplishments with you. Allow your husband to feel open and vulnerable around you by listening to him and supporting him. Emotional intimacy can enhance physical intimacy and feelings of closeness with your husband.


Be intimate with your husband, too. Allow each other to be intimate together and create a strong sense of connectivity between the two of you.

, Your view of romance and your husband’s view of romance may differ. It’s important to discuss what you consider romantic, and understand what your husband views as romantic. Discuss the things that you appreciate and that make you feel loved, and allow your husband to share the gestures he appreciates and the things you do that make him feel loved.


If your husband thinks romance is “cheesy”, express that you enjoy the occasional cheesy moment and love reflecting on cheesy memories. Say, “even cheesy moments can be meaningful, and I appreciate them.”

, Both you and your husband can decide to improve listening skills. By learning to give each other your undivided attention, you show care and love for each other. Put down the remote and look each other in the eye. Nothing says “what you say is important” like giving each other your full attention.If your husband is distracted while you are speaking, gently ask him to listen to you. Tell him how much it means to you when he gives you his full attention.

, Learn ways for you and your husband to communicate more effectively together. Save yourself the fights and make time for more romance by relating to one another in a healthy, affirming way. Instead of saying things like, “You make me feel so angry when you come home from work late” say, “I feel disappointed when I make dinner and you’re not here to enjoy it with me.” Learn to communicate without blame and instead express your feelings.When discussing your feelings, use “I” statements as much as possible, such as, “I feel angry when you don’t clean up after yourself” or “I appreciate your generosity and it makes me feel happy when you do small, thoughtful gestures for me.”

,

Instead of spending time by default together, plan your activities to enjoy each other’s company. If you want to watch tv together, make it special by preparing food together beforehand or making a theme of the night. Have one night a week that you spend together doing something you both enjoy. Ask your husband for something you’d like to do together, like a cooking class or to see a show.

Start a new activity together, such as a dance class.

,

Taking turns allows each of you to plan romantic time together. When planning the date, keep your husband’s wants and likes in mind, and plan a date you know he will enjoy. Ask him to do the same for you.

A romantic date can include a fancy evening of dressing up for dinner and a live show, or it can be fun and playful, like playing laser tag together.

, Five “love languages” describe the main ways that people give and receive love in a relationship. These “languages” include words of affirmation, acts of service, gifts, quality time, and physical touch.Discuss together the ways you give and receive love with your husband. Then, find ways for each of you to respond to each other’s love languages.


For instance, if your husband responds to words of affirmation, make sure you tell him you love him and are grateful for him. If you respond to love expressed through physical touch, tell your husband how much a gentle caress or a loving embrace mean to you.
You may enjoy expressing love through gifts, and your husband may enjoy expressing love through acts of service. By knowing each other’s “love languages”, you can appreciate the gestures by acknowledging that this is how your partner expresses love to you. Having your partner know your love language means that he knows how to give you love in a way that you receive it easily.

, Perhaps the most sure-fire sign that you would like to be kissed is a lot of sustained eye contact. When you spend time with your partner, try to hold their gaze as much as possible. This helps to build intimacy, and signals to them that you would like to be kissed.During a board game, during a meal, or simply when you are sitting together on the couch are all great times to practice your eye contact.

Listen to his response.,
Understand male perspectives.,
Realize that people have different needs.,
Put this in the context of your intimacy.,
Advance intimacy with patience.,
Address long-term lack of intimacy.",How to Get Your Boyfriend to Cuddle With You2," Open, honest communication is vital to a relationship. Non-sexual physical intimacy may not be as important to your boyfriend as it is to you. Be clear about what you're looking for and why, or he may not realize how much this matters.


Express your feelings using sentences that begin with ""I."" This is more effective than accusing him or complaining about his behavior.

, Give him your full attention, and encourage him to give feedback on what you said. The more you listen without judgement or anger, the more comfortable he'll be about opening up to you.


Pay attention to his body posture and tone of voice as well. If he seems stiff or uncommunicative, something is bothering him. It may take several patient attempts before he discusses it.

, Many guys have been conditioned to think that showing emotion is a weakness. Your boyfriend may feel vulnerable or insecure when cuddling, or feel that it doesn't match a tough, macho persona. If you think this may be the case, be patient and let him adjust slowly. It takes time for him to let down his shell and show a softer side. Even men who don't seem macho on the surface are often slower to show affection than women.


Many men are more willing to show affection in private. Ask him if there are types of affection he'd rather you didn't show in public, at least for now.

, Perhaps your boyfriend is comfortable showing intimacy, but doesn't do so as often as you'd like. In this case, understand that he probably has a lower threshold of intimacy than you do. Some people are happiest sharing physical intimacy a couple times a week, or prefer small shared moments to hours of spooning. Respect his desire for alone time or low-key activities, and ask him to respect your desire to set aside more intimate time as well.

, Respect that your boyfriend has a different comfort level about these activities than you do. Here are a couple discussions you could have depending on where you are in the relationship:


If you are not sexually intimate, your boyfriend may not be ready for the same level of intimacy that you are. You may need to put the brakes on and let him advance the relationship at his pace.
If you are sexually intimate, your boyfriend might see this as all the physical intimacy you need. Explain that non-sexual intimacy fills different needs for you.

, Find out what your boyfriend is comfortable with at this stage. Try holding his hand and gently caressing it with your thumb, hugging, or stealing a kiss when you walk down the street. If he pulls away or doesn't seem to enjoy these, try to find something more subtle. However, if he does seem to enjoy these, slowly and gradually make your affectionate attempts more obvious and frequent. Always remember, as soon as he becomes uncomfortable, abort the mission and go back to a level he enjoys. Over time, he should take the hint and start to reciprocate more. Advance this at a gradual pace and you'll get to the cuddling station in the end.


Rushing this is a big mistake. If you push him to do something he's not comfortable with, he may resent this and become less cooperative.

, Yes, patience and compromise are keys to a relationship, but this is a two-way street. If your partner doesn't listen to you or take this discussion seriously, he is not meeting his end of the relationship. Make it clear to him that you expect him to respect your feelings, and make an honest effort to find a compromise. If you feel starved for affection and see no attempt at improvement, it may be time to end the relationship.

Go to a restaurant when it’s very slow (e.g., 3:00pm).
Hang out at home.
Make sure you stay in safe areas and follow the rules.

, A lot of first kisses happen during movies. Whether you go out to see a movie or take in a movie at home, watching a movie allows you to get cozy with your partner. This often results in a kiss.


A romantic movie can stir up some romance.
A scary movie can get you snuggling in for safety.
A funny movie may put you both in a positive mood.

, Perfumes and colognes were invented to attract romantic partners. Wear a sweet, subtle fragrance to lure your boyfriend or girlfriend to kiss you. Be careful not to over do it! Too much fragrance will have the opposite effect.Clinique Happy is a nice feminine scent.
Lacoste Challenge is a subtle, more masculine scent.

, One of the most important ways to prepare for a wonderful kiss is to make sure your mouth is clean and fresh! Brush your teeth, floss your teeth, and use mouthwash before meeting up with your boyfriend or girlfriend.You may want to bring some mouthwash or mints along with you just in case you need freshen up.

Whisper sweet nothings.,
Compliment them.,
Talk about kissing.,
Be confident!",How to Get Your Boyfriend or Girlfriend to Kiss You First3," An excellent way to flirt with your partner and send a clear signal that you’d like to be kissed is to whisper in their ear. Get very close to them and say something simple like, “Thanks for a wonderful date.” Your body close to them, your face by their face, and your breath on their ear are sure to ramp up the kissing desire!You can also try giving them a simple compliment, such as, ""I like your shirt,"" or, ""You smell nice.""

, Making your partner feel confident helps give them the courage to kiss you. Tell them some of the things you like about them. If you are feeling very bold, be sure to mention that you like their lips.You can say, “You have really nice eyes.”
You can say, “You’re always so kind to strangers on the street. I really like that about you.”
If you are feeling saucy, say, “You have really nice lips. I really like the shape of them.”

, It is possible that your partner may not be thinking about kissing. You can bring kissing to their mind (and encourage them to kiss you) by bringing up the topic of kissing in conversation.For example, if you see other people kissing (in a movie or on the street) you can point it out. You can say, “It looks like they are having fun.”
Or you could say something like, “Did you know that the human mouth is packed with nerve endings? That is why kissing feels so good.”
You can also say outright to your partner, ""If it's okay with you, I would love to kiss you.""

, If all else fails, just do the kissing yourself! Sometimes you’ve got to be the one to make the first move. You can boost your confidence and find the gusto to go in for a kiss by looking for positive signals. Has your partner been making eye contact, standing very close, and paying you compliments? Then chance are, they are waiting for you to kiss them.Ask the person before you kiss them! It will diffuse your nervousness about whether or not they want to kiss you because you'll have a clear answer.
If you get nervous, you can excuse yourself for a moment and go take some deep breaths.
Focus on how you will feel after the kiss (relaxed, relieved, romantic) and any nervousness should fade into the background.

Take it slow.",How to Get True Love," You need to be “available” to find true love. The first thing is to get over heartache or past love, accept the loss, and start to come to terms with it. This takes time. It’s also hard. But, you’ll never be able to move on if you don’t stop to grieve.Make the choice to let go. Say to yourself, “It’s over and I need to move on.” Otherwise, you may end up sabotaging your future efforts.
Express your pain. Part of grieving is emotion! Let it out directly, vent to a friend, or write it out in a letter that you’ll never send to your ex.
Forgive. This is a key part of moving on. It doesn’t mean forgetting what happened, but choosing to release your hurt and anger and move forward.;
, Grieving is totally natural, but try not to get carried away. Take ownership for the past and don’t cast yourself as a victim in love. After all, you played a part in your relationships.While grieving, acknowledge your role in the heartbreak. Ask yourself, “Did I go wrong? How? What could I have done differently?”
Self-pity is easy and feels good. Resist it. Say, “I’m not going to keep feeling bad about someone else and what they did; I’m going to start to feel good.”

, As said, coming to terms with the past isn’t easy. But you need to be honest and confront it head-on, rather than letting things fester. Do some serious self-examination. Look at your personal qualities with an eye to self-improvement.List your strengths and weaknesses. Write down things – qualities, talents, habits, ticks – that you consider to be strengths, like generosity or emotional openness. Then, list weaknesses. Are you a natural pessimist, for example? Maybe you are stingy with money?
Note common elements. Do you always tend to love the same type of people? Are there mistakes, patterns, or repeated dynamics in your past relationships? Try to find and identify what they are.

, You may be hurting, but try to see it as an opportunity to learn about yourself and what can and will make you happy in the future. Finding true love is hard, to be sure, and not guaranteed. But you’ll have a better shot with better self-understanding.Remember things as they were. Don’t idealize your past loves, but distinguish what made the relationship exciting and memorable from what caused it to fail.
Be hopeful and open to love. One heartbreak doesn’t mean that you won’t ever love again, but you have to let it happen.

, Whether you are long single or getting over heart-break, try to value your independence. Remember that you don’t need true love to make you happy, because happiness comes from inside. It’s OK (and healthy) to focus on yourself sometimes.Being single comes with freedom: you can do the things you enjoy, when you want to. Do you want to go for a swim at 6:00 every morning? Sure thing. Do you like to sit around and watch TV in sweatpants after work? Go right ahead!
Being independent gives you the chance to be selfish, too. Focus on your career and work long hours, if you’re ambitious. Or, spend more time on your hobbies and friends.
Use the time for self-exploration, too. Being single, you can spend energy figuring out your needs rather than on those of a partner.

, Some of us already have a clear vision of true love, while others need some time to figure it out. You may have a sense of what you’re looking for, but need time to articulate your ideal partner.Start with your core needs. What things are “must haves”? Do you need a partner who shares your social or religious values? Who wants a family? Who understands and validates your career?Learn to understand your own emotional needs. Think of earlier relationships and what made you feel fulfilled and what didn’t. You might need good chemistry, for example, but you also might need loyalty or a strong intellectual connection.
Be aware that true love isn’t a magic potion. It can’t make you feel worthwhile, happy, or whole in life, at least not by itself. These things ultimately have to come from inside of you.

, Remember that self-examination? Start to act on it. Figure out what positive qualities you’ve got going, but also those you need to work on. Set up clear goals to aspire and work toward.Write your goals down. What do you want to be better at? Do you need to be a better listener? To show more empathy? Or perhaps to be more generous with your time?
Ask yourself whether each goal is realistic, achievable, and about you as a person.
Make sure that the goals are also worded positively. That is, they should be about getting better and not at removing something from your life. Write that you want to get better at expressing emotion, and not that you want to be less cold to others.
Set a time-frame and list specific things that you are doing or will do to address each goal. To be more generous with your time, for instance, you might say that you will volunteer at a soup kitchen once a month for the next three months.
Set your list in a visible place. Put it on your mirror, your fridge door, or in your office to see. Keep it close so you can see it every day.

, Try to be the best person you can, in mind, spirit, and body. That said, pay attention to your health as you better yourself. Eat good food, sleep well, rest, and reduce stress. Your health is important in preparing yourself for true love. Make it a priority.Exercise, a good diet, and rest will give you more energy and vim and put you in a positive frame of mind. Aim for a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and lean meats, for example.
Take up an exercise routine. Doctors recommend at least 130 minutes of moderate activity per week for optimal health. This will help if you’re still healing from heartache, releasing feel-good, depression-beating endorphins.
Exercise will not only make you healthy and happier, but it can also help you manage stress and boost your self-confidence around other people – all important in finding a partner., Finding someone special – maybe even a true love – takes a resolution on your part. You have to put yourself on the line, to get out there and meet people. But are you ready? Take some time to self-assess before making the plunge.Have you properly grieved? Did you take the time to come to terms with your earlier losses in love? If not, you might be acting for the wrong reasons.
Are you happy on your own? Looking for someone to “make you happy” or fill a void in your life is usually a bad idea.
Have you let go of any lingering anger? Are you emotionally open to a relationship?
If you’ve said yes to these questions, there’s a good chance that you are really ready to start meeting new people.

, There are tons of ways to meet people and connect. Start with places where you’re more likely to find others with shared interests or views. Clubs and group activities are great for this reason. The common ground will also mean you don’t have to worry as much about breaking the ice.Sign up for ballroom dance lessons, for example. You’ll learn great moves and get to boogie with many different partners.
Try a book club at your local library, alternatively. Read and discuss interesting novels at monthly or weekly meetings.
Are you artistic? Sign up for painting or sculpting at a local college, or an art appreciation course at your nearest art museum.
Take a language course. Have you always wanted to learn Italian? Sign up for lessons – you’ll meet new and very interesting people.

, Nowadays online dating has gone mainstream. In fact, nearly half of Americans know someone who is using an online dating service or who met a partner online. It’s becoming common for most age groups, even people in their 40s, 50s, and up.Sign up for a service like Match.com or OKCupid. Most use metrics to try to match you with people who share not just interests but also values and outlook.
One of the big pros of online dating is that you can, potentially, meet a lot of new people. You can also filter them out. On the other hand, the choice might be a bit overwhelming. Plus, your potential dates are not always accurate in their personal descriptions.

, While the rise of internet dating has cut into tradition venues like bars and clubs, people do still meet each other face-to-face. There are plenty of other places and ways to make new friends and meet new people, without a computer screen standing between you.Blind dates can be spotty, but they sometimes work out. Ask a friend to set you up or, if you need more assurance, try a professional dating agency.
You might also consider signing up for a singles holiday. There are plenty of companies that offer getaways aimed at singles and encouraging romance.
Are you a romantic at heart? Why not place a classified ad? “SM seeks SF with a good sense of humor for romantic walks on the beach and fireside chats.”

, Love builds from friendship in most cases. Most everyone wants to be friends with the person they date. If you're looking for true love, start out by building a genuine friendship and a relationship based on affection, shared values, and mutual respect.


Let intimacy grow naturally. You might feel ready for it right away or it might take a while. The important thing is not to rush it.
Don’t be afraid to fall in love. If a person makes you feel fulfilled and happy, they may be the right material.

It is usually not healthy to put a deadline on grieving, it's just something that ""is"", so be careful not to rush your grieving time simply because you want to be over this person quickly.;
, Whatever this person meant to you before the breakup, you are worth too much to keep feeling hurt for the sake of this person. Remind yourself that your needs matter most now and that feeling normal again is your immediate aim.

, Whether you broke up with them or it was the other way around, this is all about incompatibility. When someone doesn't want to be with the other person anymore, the compatibility is broken and it's for the best that you don't try to kid yourselves that it'll work. Consider how realistic it is to keep wanting to be with this person––if it's clear that you're not going to be a good couple or good friends, then it's not realistic.


If this person was a negative influence in your life, then you're better off without them.

You won't like them as much when you keep reminding yourself what didn't work about being with them.

, Block them on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. When you can't keep reading their updates, you will no longer be reminded of their presence and you'll care a lot less about what they're up to.

, Distraction is a time consuming activity, which will make it ideal for not thinking about this person. Things you can do include:


Start a new hobby
Go out with friends
Volunteer somewhere.

Talk to your boyfriend.,
Ask him directly rather than assuming things are maturing in the relationship.,
Break the touching rule, if you know that he would be okay with it.,
Offer desirable advice.,
Show your boyfriend that you appreciate him.,
Make time for activities you both enjoy.,
Spend more time with your boyfriend.,
Make him feel good about himself.,
Give him reason to trust you.,
Take note of how he treats you.",How to Get Closer to Your Boyfriend," For example, if your boyfriend is into sports, it's most likely because he plans to be good at the sport, he enjoys watching a game, or sports are just fun for him. If he is more of a science boy, aka an adorable nerd, it's most likely because he is smart, or finds it fun when doing math and science. He may also be interested in getting good grades for his future.;
, Mostly every guy is a sports fan. They love it when a lady watches a game or talks it for a little bit. It's a turn-on.

, Also seek to enjoy the things he does. If your BF enjoys certain things, his friends are most likely to be into the same sort of things. They may all be sports fans or be in a math group, for example. Try putting yourself with him and his friends.


If you don't like some or all of his friends, learn to be polite and still hang around them without causing tension. You don't have to be best friends with any of them, just tolerant.

, Tell him about your day, and find out about his. If he had a bad day, find a way to cheer him up. You might give him a big hug and let him know that you care about him.

, If you feel that you two are comfortable with each other, there is nothing wrong with asking him flat out if he wants to take the relationship to the next level. This isn't advisable to do in the very beginning of things, as you may want to be certain that he wants to commit to you in a relationship.

, Flirt with him—do playful pushes or pokes, and see how he reacts. If he flirts back, then great. Don't be too persistent, though, or he will probably get annoyed.

, For example, if you find your boyfriend is writing a song, but he can't find anything to write about, give him some suggestions! Or, if he's planning to draw a picture or write a poem, give him ideas on what to draw, or a topic for a poem to write. However, avoid advising him where it's clear he's not interested in your opinion or meddling in his family and friend relationships.

, If he is on a sports team, go to his games. Cheer for him as loudly as you can, so that he knows you are there for him and him only.

, For example, if you don't have much to do, you can offer to throw a ball around or play basketball with him. If he's going kayaking, making miniatures or going to a rock wall climbing class, join in. You might find new activities you love, or at least, some activities to be shared together.

, Invite him over to your place, or find a way to spend time with him alone or together with close friends. At the same time, respect his personal space. Don't forget that it's perfectly okay for each of you to have time alone and away from each other.

, Buy him a present. Compliment him. Joke with him. As you begin to develop more personal bonds with him, he will feel more comfortable around you.

, Have faith in your relationship, and don't cheat on him. Have trust in him and his actions—he will take notice. Remember that trust and communication are the most essential parts to a healthy relationship. A lack of trust will most surely bring a relationship to the gutter.

, Does he make attempts to make you feel better if you are having a bad day? Does he make you happy, or make you laugh? Does he respect you? If so, you are well on your way to reaching the next step with your boyfriend.

Be the person you want to be.",How to Get a Woman to Fall in Love with You," Don’t worry; there won’t be an exam. However, attraction is all about chemistry, and specifically, a group of chemicals called “monoamines.” These chemicals send messages between your brain and your body, and they’re the reason love can literally make your skin tingle or cause you to forget your name when you’re around the woman of your dreams.Dopamine (where we get the word “dope”) is a “feel-good” neurotransmitter responsible for rewards and motivation, among other things. When you’re around a person you’re attracted to, dopamine is released into your brain, making you enjoy the time you spend together and want more of it.Norepinephrine, sometimes known as noradrenaline (but not the same as adrenalin)is responsible for sending messages to your central nervous system. It helps decide what is most important to focus on at any given moment. When you lose track of time and end up spending 5 hours on a date with someone you’re into, norepinephrine has decided that the woman you love is more important than any of the other information around you.Serotonin regulates a host of functions, including mood, sleep, body temperature, and sexual desire.When your skin starts to tingle around that special someone, it’s because serotonin has dropped your body temperature, making your skin slightly more conductive of electricity. Pretty magical stuff.
Humans may also emit pheromones like other animals do, although scientists aren’t exactly sure if they work the same way. You can’t consciously smell pheromones, but your body picks up on others’, deciding what it thinks is attractive and what isn’t.;
, Because so much is down to how chemicals interact in each person’s body, don’t take it personally if the woman you’re interested in doesn’t return your interest. It probably has nothing to do with you as a person. Studies show that your brain decides what’s attractive in as little as one second, and it’s not really within your control.Research has even shown that taking hormonal contraceptives can change a woman’s “type” at certain points during the month.Biochemistry: it’s some wacky stuff.

, No, this type isn’t the sweet talk you might offer during a chat. This is about identifying the messages that body language gives off when we’re attracted to someone else. There are a few basic messages that your body language communicates when you are interested in someone:I’m available
I’m approachable and open
I’m interested
I’m fertile

, Imagine that you’ve run into the woman you’re interested in at the coffee shop. You don’t know whether she is interested in you. Examine how she’s holding her body for some clues.“Open” body language includes relaxed, uncrossed arms and legs and looking upward from time to time. “Closed” body language includes crossed arms or legs, body tension, and keeping your focus on something like your phone.
The direction of her feet may also tell you something. If they’re pointed toward you, she is likely feeling into the interaction.
If she’s holding something between you, such as a purse or bookbag, this could be a sign she’s trying to signal distance. If she catches your eye, smiles, and moves the bookbag out of the chair across from her, it’s a good bet she’s signaling “I’m available.”, The eyes are the windows to the soul. They’re also really good clues as to whether someone is interested in you or not. Eye contact communicates a bunch of messages, including some you might not be aware of.Make eye contact with her, and maintain it for 4-5 seconds. Give her a smile. If she returns your gaze and smiles back, you may be in luck.Eye contact while you’re talking with someone signals interest and engagement. If she’s looking at you about 70% of the time while you’re talking and about 50% of the time while she’s talking, it’s a good sign that she’s interested in the interaction. (You can signal your interest by following the same ratios.)When we’re aroused (through stress, sexual desire, what have you) our pupils dilate. If her pupils look dilated, she may be excited to see you., If she returns your smile, it could signal that she enjoys your interaction. However, some people also smile when they’re nervous or uncomfortable. Watch which muscles move when she smiles.Genuine, or duchenne, smiles, use the muscles around the eyes as well as around the mouth.Fake smiles tend to only use the muscles around the mouth (although some people are very good at faking). If she isn’t smiling with her eyes, she may be feeling uncomfortable or trying to appease you.

, Humans experience certain physiological reactions when they’re attracted to someone else.While these aren’t universal, they can help clue you in about whether she’s just being polite or whether she’s as interested in you as you are in her.Flushing or blushing. When we’re aroused, blood rushes to our cheeks. (This is one reason why some women wear blush.) People may also flush when they’re nervous or embarrassed, though, so don’t rely on this as your only cue.
Plumper, redder lips. That blood doesn’t only rush to our cheeks. It also goes to the lips, which can appear fuller and redder as they fill with blood. (Hence, why some women wear lipstick.) Licking the lips is also a good sign that the other person is attracted to you., Don’t invade anyone’s personal space, but if, say, she’s gone up for some coffee creamer you could get up and get some napkins. This will give you the chance to give her a whiff of your pheromones (remember those chemicals that signal the other person’s brain, saying “Hey! I’m hot!”).If you’re already interacting with the woman of your dreams, lean in a little closer or tilt your head. Not only do these signal that you’re interested in the interaction, they can also send those chemical love-messengers heading her way., These are also known as “pickup lines,” or sometimes “ice-breakers.” However, you don’t have to be creepy or cocky to use an opening gambit effectively. Scientists suggest that there are three types of openers, and they vary in their effectiveness:Direct: These are honest, no-nonsense, get straight to the point openers. For example, “Hi, you’re pretty cute. Can I buy you a drink?” or “I’m kind of shy, but I’d love to get to know you.” In general, men tend to prefer getting these from potential romantic partners.

Innocuous: These start a conversation, but don’t go directly in for the goal. For example, “What coffee would you recommend?” or “There’s an empty chair at my table, would you like to sit here?” In general, women tend to prefer getting these from potential romantic partners.

Cute/flippant: These involve humor, but they can also be cheesy or even mean-spirited. These are the typical “pickup line,” like “Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?” or “You know what would look great on you? Me.” In general, both men and women rank these as the least preferred option to receive from a potential romantic partner.
Your relationship strategy will also play a role in choosing an opener. Studies suggest that people going for something long-term will more likely use an honest and supportive gambit, while people going for something short-term will more likely use manipulation or dishonesty. If it’s love you’re looking for, go for honest and supportive every time., Do something that will make her take notice of you. Don’t try to make yourself into something you aren’t, though. Being yourself (maybe the best possible version of you) is the best way to ensure that if she’s interested in you, she’s really interested in you, not somebody you’re trying to be to get yourself noticed.


Take care of yourself. Eat healthy, exercise, and dress in clothes that express something about you. You don’t have to be a fashion model or a superstar athlete, but keeping yourself neat, clean, and groomed will show off your physical health, which humans have evolved to find innately attractive.Studies show that women value social traits, such as compassion and friendliness, as highly (or even more) than physical attractiveness.Do something that shows you care about other people. Volunteer at your local food bank, give blood, bail a friend out of a sticky situation, organize a charity auction. Show her that there's more to you than meets the eye. She'll be impressed that you give back and curious about what else you have to offer.
Show her your funny side. Research shows that both men and women rank a sense of humor as one of the most attractive qualities in a potential partner.Joke around, make others laugh -- just don’t belittle or use mean or bitter humor, because that’s a surefire way to kill the mood instantly.A little playfulness is also likely to benefit you.Excel at something you're good at, preferably in her company. What do you do well? It could be anything from tennis, rock climbing, or football, to humor, math, or debate. Whatever it is, stand out for excellence in that area.
Signal with your own body language. Women tend to be better at interpreting body language than men are, which can be good for you if you know how to use it.Things like making your body a little bigger, squaring your shoulders when you stand, and playfully bumping or elbowing your guy friends if you’re all hanging out with her can help signal that you’re trying to get her attention.Put yourself out there. Remember: fortune favors the brave. If you're stuck in your apartment constantly, you're probably not using your time in the best way. And if you don't hit a challenge at least some of the time, you might never see results.

, Both women and men are drawn to confident people. However, cockiness is usually a turn-off, so make sure your confidence doesn’t take the leap into arrogance.True self-confidence comes from within. It’s knowing who you are, accepting who you are, and being confident that you’re pretty great at being you. You don’t need validation from others to make you feel good about yourself. When you’re confident in yourself, you inspire that confidence in others.Cockiness happens when you base your self-esteem on external sources, like compliments or achievements. It often comes from a place of insecurity. You may feel like you need to put others down to feel better about yourself, or like everything is a competition between you and the rest of the world.It’s fine to accept compliments and praise, especially if you can acknowledge the roles others played in your success or achievement. For example, if you’re a star athlete, you probably still have a great team behind you. When you win the big game, accept praise for your good performance, but remember to extend that praise to your teammates, too. That type of behavior shows true self-confidence, not cockiness.

, No, it doesn't need to be written down, and it doesn't need to involve little x's and o's on a whiteboard. Be strategic about what you do and you'll give yourself a better chance of winning a girl's heart. Be amateurish and you'll likely lower your chances.


If you're in love with one girl, it's OK to focus on winning her heart. When love hits us, it's like a ton of bricks, and we often feel helpless. That's natural.
If, however, you want to find love in general, try socializing with several different women. You'll increase your chances of finding someone you genuinely bond with, and rejection from one won't seem so bad if you have the possibility of another waiting in the wings. There are several other benefits to this strategy:

You'll have a better idea of what you want. We often don't know what we want until we see it. Put yourself out there and chances are you'll find a woman you naturally gel with, instead of forcing it with someone you thought you knew.
Socializing with several women is not the same as being a player. If you want to find love, date around, but only romantically involve yourself with one woman at a time. Don't go into a relationship hoping to exploit or manipulate.



, Really find out who she is, what she stands for, where she's coming from. She will appreciate your interest in what makes her tick. Ask open-ended questions, actively listen and engage with her answers, and don’t make assumptions or jump to conclusions about her.People love talking about themselves. This is just the way things are. Don't forget to engage in conversation and give her information about yourself, but get her engaged in something she likes talking about and you'll find it's a lot easier going.
One way to do this is to ask great questions. Ask about her passions (""What do you love to do?""), her inspirations (""What makes you tick?""), and her goals (""What do you want to achieve?""), for example. Questions that ask her about her future may help her envision you in it. Questions about what’s going on right now tend to be more surface-level.Social psychologist Arthur Aron has a list of 36 open-ended, creative questions you can ask to prompt getting to know a person better.Now is not the time to harsh on your ex-girlfriends or trash your boss. This level of negativity could make the woman uncomfortable. If you’re saying bad things about other people to her, she’ll also have to wonder if you’d do the same about her with someone else. Stick to positive topics.

, These things take time. Don't expect to win her heart in a matter of days. Slow but steady wins the race. Set realistic expectations so that you're not disappointed if she doesn't fall for you immediately.


If she gives you her number, perfect, but don't beg for it. Call her when you get her number, but not too much. Some days, give her a chance to call you!Don’t spill your whole life story at once. If you really like this woman, it could be tempting to give her the “hard sell” on why you’re the man for her. Take it slowly. Leaving a little mystery to yourself gives her things to ask you about, and doesn’t make you seem desperate or -- even worse -- like you don’t understand boundaries., Offer substantive, personal compliments for the best effect. And be reasonable. You want to compliment her just enough so that she knows you like her more than a friend, but not so much that she thinks you're desperate or fishing for compliments in return. Studies show that women are interested in men who show their interest, but not overwhelmingly.Compliment her skills and abilities first and foremost. She was born with her looks, but she worked for her smarts and her talents. Compliment her when her wonderful personality shines through.
If you want to compliment her looks, try to make things more personal than the generic “Wow, you have pretty eyes.” For example, you could say “Your eyes are such an unusual shade of blue. Do your parents also have blue eyes?” Noting that you’re paying attention to her also works. For example: “Did you get a haircut? Short hair looks so good on you.”
Consider complimenting things about her that you find unique and interesting. Most women have heard the “You have a great smile” line a hundred times. Look for things that show you’re really engaged with her as a person. For example:

“It's so easy talking to you. I feel like I could talk to you all day long.”
“I like the way you think.”
It took a lot of courage for you to speak up like that.”



, Find a way to gently start flirting with her. It's going to be hard at first, because you really, really like her, but it will get a lot easier as you begin to establish routines and get to know her better.Smile and maintain good eye contact. A woman can tell a lot about how interested you are just by looking at your eyes. Likewise, a smile is just as important. Smile so that you project happiness, and have good eye contact so that you project confidence.
Mimic her body language. You’re not trying to be an exact mirror here. Instead, if she’s relaxed and open, be that way too. If she makes a lot of hand gestures when she’s talking, incorporate a few more into your conversation.
Develop inside jokes or learn to playfully tease. Inside jokes are a great way to flirt and bond at the same time. They are conspiratorial, meaning that you both feel you are in on something together, and it's just you. Make an inside joke out of pretty much anything that you two experience together.When you playfully tease, make sure she knows you're teasing. Wink at her to communicate your sarcasm, or tell her that you're joking. Preferably, tease her about something she does really well so that she won't have to guess whether you're being serious or not.



, In general, opposite-sex friends don’t touch that much. They may go in for a hug, but they usually don’t do things like holding hands or brushing someone else’s skin. Reaching for her hand once in a while, lightly brushing her arm when you say something, or pushing a stray lock of hair behind her ear will say, “Hey, I’m really interested in you.”Obviously, you should only do this if you’re already confident that she enjoys spending time with you. Don’t grab for a girl the first time you meet her, and avoid touching any personal areas unless you are clearly invited.
If she doesn’t appear to enjoy or react well to your touch, don’t try it again. Respect her boundaries at all times, even if/when you don’t understand them.

, Once you're ready to make the final push, you need to ask her out on a date. A date will be the perfect opportunity for you two to learn more about each other, and perhaps to even steal a kiss.When you ask her, keep it casual but don’t be unclear. You might end up in the dreaded “friend zone,” and it’s often difficult to move from friendship to romance. The best way to avoid this is to be upfront about your interests. You don’t have to overwhelm her by immediately declaring your love (in fact, don’t do that), but saying something casual like, “I’ve really been enjoying hanging out with you. What would you say to a “real” date? My treat!” can help let her know that you’re interested in becoming more than friends without sounding like you’re proposing marriage.Do something that's exciting. An exciting date — such as a haunted house, a theme park with rollercoasters, or a sports event — helps release a powerful hormone (called oxytocin) that's responsible for feelings of bonding and togetherness.If it's the right moment, go in for a kiss. If you feel like she's a little hesitant, it's best to keep the kiss for the second or third date. Keep the kiss short and sweet, and whatever you do, don't try to shove your tongue down her throat.

, Good communication skills can help you win the woman of your dreams. Actively listening to her shows that you’re really interested and engaged with what she thinks and feels. That’s very attractive. Try some of these techniques:Restate and clarify. Don’t assume that you understand what she’s saying. Instead, ask for clarification when you need it: “I’m not sure I understood you correctly. I heard _____. Is that what you meant?” Then give her the chance to clear things up.
Encourage her. Ask little questions like “And then what happened?” or “How did you respond?” “Minimal encouragers,” like nodding, saying “uh-huh,” and “Go on” are also helpful.
Summarize the important things. If you’ve had a conversation where you shared a lot of information, summarize it. This shows you paid attention, and gives her the opportunity to clear anything up. For example: “Okay, so what I heard was that tomorrow is going to be a horrible day for you and you don’t want to be stressed out, so you’d like me to pick you up from work and go see a dumb action movie together. Is that right?”

, Listening is half of communication, but you also have to know how to speak. Learn to ask questions, avoid blaming, and communicate directly and honestly. It will make a world of difference, and may just make her feel all fuzzy for you and your great communication skills.Ask questions. This is especially helpful if you aren’t sure you understand the situation. For example, she may say she wants advice but really just needs a sympathetic ear. Ask her: “Do you want me to try to help you find a solution, or do you just need someone to vent to? I’m cool with either one.”
Use “I”-statements instead of “you” messages. “You”-statements can sound blaming, and they can make people shut down and feel defensive. For example, saying “You’re always making us late and I hate it” communicates your feelings clearly, but it’s also going to hurt hers and make her avoid talking with you. Try an “I”-statement instead: “I know you need a little extra time to get ready, but I get really stressed out when I’m late to things. How can I help you get the time you need and get us to dinner on time?”
Speak honestly and directly. Don’t beat around the bush and don’t be passive aggressive. Say what you mean, mean what you say, and be kind and respectful all the time., Women love men who have a little bit of mystery tied up in their persona. It doesn't take much to develop — don't share every detail, don't brag about the things you do, get other people to like (and vouch for) you — but it's hard to do correctly. At the same time, make yourself available to her. There's nothing worse than putting in all that hard work only to leave her hanging because you can no longer be found.A good way to think of this is as staying independent. Healthy relationships allow both people to live their lives and pursue interests on their own, as well as spending time together. If you don’t devote every moment of your day to thinking about her or pursuing her, you’ll be showing her that you’re independent and confident, which are both highly attractive qualities.There’s no need to play mind games. If you want to call her, call. If she calls when you’re genuinely busy, tell her you’ll have to call her back later. You don’t have to wait a certain number of minutes between texts or a certain number of days between phone calls. Just live your life, and make her a nice part of it.

, You don't necessarily have to be her best friend, but show her why she deserves to trust you. Be there when she needs you. If she asks you to keep a secret, keep it. If you say you'll do something, follow through. Trust is crucial to developing intimate, long-lasting relationships, and it can be broken in a heartbeat.Don't get into it just for sex. This will make you an untrustworthy guy in her book. Don't pressure her into doing things that she's not comfortable doing — it'll drive her further away.
If you have to back out on something, give her an honest explanation. She’s less likely to feel let down if you tell her what happened and communicate that you’re really disappointed about having to miss out. And don’t make a habit of flaking.

, People don’t all express or interpret love in the same way. Some people love getting gifts. Others would be just as happy if you did the dishes every night. Psychologist Gary Chapman argues that people have “love languages” that they use to show love and understand demonstrations of love from other people. Knowing her love language will help you show you care in a way she can really connect with.The five love languages are “Words of Affirmation,” “Acts of Service,” “Receiving Gifts,” “Quality Time,” and “Physical Touch.”

“Words of Affirmation” include compliments, encouragement, or expressions of your feelings.
“Acts of Service” include things like doing chores or running errands for the other person to show you care.
“Receiving Gifts” is pretty obvious: gifts, cards, and tangible expression of affection.
“Quality Time” is uninterrupted time with your partner without distractions.
“Physical Touch” includes any demonstration of physical affection, including hugging, kissing, or sex.


Chapman’s website has a quiz you can take. You can also ask her friends and observe her reactions to determine what her primary love language could be. (Alternatively, you could just ask her to take the quiz too, but you might not feel ready to spring the word “love.”)Look at how she treats you. People usually default to using the love language they connect with for other people. Thus, if her primary love language is “Receiving Gifts,” she may surprise you with small tokens from time to time, such as a little gift or a card. Notice what she seems to emphasize in her demonstrations, and return them in kind.

, Her family and friends probably mean a lot to her, and they generally have a pretty hefty influence over how people think and behave.Win them over, and you’ll be closer to winner her, too. Plus, you’ll be showing her that you’re here for the long haul.



Dress nice, show manners, and be respectful of her friends and family.
Be yourself around them. That can be hard, especially with all the pressure once you finally meet her parents, but it’s important that you be genuine, honest, and yourself. She’ll pick up if you’re different around her loved ones than you are around her, and family are notoriously good at detecting behavior that isn’t genuine.
Stay easygoing, interested, and kind. If her friends gently tease or joke about you, take it like a man and chuckle. When the situation presents itself, ask her friends questions about their lives and be genuinely interested in them. Do nice things for her friends, such as setting them up with a guy friend or boosting their self-esteem.

, In a relationship and dating, you're going to make mistakes. It's how you recover from your mistakes that defines you, and gives the woman a chance to truly love you.Don't be afraid to say sorry or admit fault. When you make a mistake, acknowledge it without blaming anyone else for your actions or feelings. For example: “I’m really sorry I hurt your feelings. I know you were upset when I forgot our date. I really do care about you, but I’m terrible at remembering things. Next time I’ll put a reminder in my calendar to make sure I don’t miss out on spending time with you again.”

, Those first few weeks or months of dating are amazing. You’re learning all this new stuff about each other and the chemicals in your body are going haywire with all your romantic attraction. As you settle into a more stable relationship, that first blast may die down (although it can often cycle back, too).Make a conscious effort to continue building your friendship and your relationship.Make time for each other. You may be busy. You may have tough times. Make time for each other, even if you’re tired or your feelings are hurt. Don’t let things sink to a level of name-calling, resentment, or contempt.
Pick a hobby or activity to pursue together. Working toward a common goal can help you feel more connected and bonded.
Turn off the technology. Make some time without cellphones, TV, or computers for just the two of you. It can be easy to end up spending time in the same room without ever feeling like you’re really spending time together., Ultimately, you have to show her who you are in your soul, at your very deepest, to give her the chance to love you. If you pretend to be someone else, she's only going to love a caricature of you. So don't be afraid to let down your barriers, get a little vulnerable, and show her who you really are. Chances are she'll love you for it.

Understand your qualities and traits.,
Be confident.,
Dress for the occasion.,
Make a habit of staying well groomed.,
Smile often.",How to Get All the Girls1," We possess a lot of qualities that would attract and intrigue us.

, Approaching a woman should be both fun and exciting; it's an opportunity to get to know someone new. The difficulty of approaching someone reveals your confidence.Confidence is always considered the best quality in a person.

, A part of looking good boils down to knowing how to dress because of where you are going. Music t-shirt, sandals, and shorts might be great for a festival or time out on the beach, but that won't work for a night out on the town. Keep in mind some basic fashion tips.

Invest in a nice pair of shoes and keep them polished. Shoes should be the most expensive article of clothing you wear.
Keep things simple. Don't overdo the colors and the accessories.Update your wardrobe. New is good, and every man you see who is well-dressed and confident is usually sporting clothes that look new.

, When it boils down to it, humans do gravitate to what they find attractive such as a nice bistro, a wonderful book cover, and a lovely smile. We tend to associate positive qualities with what is good and attractive.

A sloppy head of hair and untamed whiskers sends the wrong message to others. Keep up with some simple grooming tips.Whichever facial hair trend you follow (mustache, beard, stubble) keep things tidy.
Cologne is helpful but don't over do it.
Pick a barber/hairstylist who listens to your needs and see them at least once a month.

, Having a good time and being comfortable should be your main goals when going out. A smile signals both these feelings, and women will take notice.

Pay attention to women.,
Talk to her.,
Keep the conversation balanced.,
Figure out if she's interested.",How to Get All the Girls2," Before you can even approach a woman, you must observe their body language. On average, men tend to miss out on initial inviting body cues from women.

Here are some body language cues that should signal a woman is approachable:

Tossing of hair.
Exposure of neck.
An open torso.
Wrist exposure.
Showing of hands.

, Conversation is very key to making a good first impression. In general, conversation and talking makes a huge impact on a woman's interest in a man; it opens the opportunity to make a connection, and most women do connect through conversation.

Do your best to find common grounds. Similar interests and similarity in general is something that naturally attracts us to one another., Avoid sounding like an expert on topics; it comes off as desperate to be authoritative not to mention you'll avoid connecting with her by making it all about you.

To avoid this, ask questions that invite her to talk and build off of what she has already mentioned with follow up questions., Once conversation is ignited, return to paying attention to cues to see if the woman is intrigued with you and your approach.


Notice if she is getting close to you. The closer a woman allows herself to be with you, the more interested she may be.Pay attention to the conversation. If she carries things beyond introductions and small talk, she might be gaining comfort in your presence.
Her eyes speak to you. If she makes eye contact and scans you from head to toe, that's a sign of intrigue.

Set social goals.,
Cope with rejection.,
Be nice.,
Get her phone number.",How to Get All the Girls3," If you are making a big adjustment in your life such as starting over from a long relationship or abandoning internet-dating for social scenes with more human interaction, then give yourself a lot of credit. Changing your lifestyle can be difficult at first, but setting the right pace by making obtainable goals will set you on the right direction.

Start by talking to at least one woman when you go out and build from that to talking to two or three on a given night., Investing your energy and time talking to women becomes difficult with rejection. Do not despair. Even the most well known celebrities and ladies-men face rejection.

Also, the more women you speak to, the more rejection you'll face; it's the inevitable. However, you will also increase your chances of succeeding by talking to more women., Kindness goes a long way when talking to people, and nothing is more of a deal-maker than a woman saying you are ""nice""; that's code for ""you're interesting"".When you start talking to more and more woman in one social setting, people will notice, and it will resonate with other women.

, When you have entered a conversation with a woman, you might need to set the pace for getting contact information. Create a habit of asking a woman for her number before saying goodbye. Always ask even if you may not use her contact information. Good practices will turn into good habits. Remember, not every woman you approach might peak your interest. Speak to all sorts of women, even ones who are not your type, and be sure to ask for phone numbers.

Adding women to Facebook, Instagram, and other social platforms is a start but lacks that intimacy of personal contact info.

Don't let others get you down.",How to Get a Guy's Attention as a Bigger Girl," Make sure you are always smiling and be sure to be positive. Guys tend to be more drawn to the type of girls that don't complain and argue. Be bubbly and cheerful. Also, it makes people feel more sympathetic (and not annoyed) towards you when you are actually having a bad/rough day. This may be hard.
, Try to stay away from asking people to do things for you when you can clearly do them yourself.

That being said, it's perfectly okay to ask for help when you really do need it.

, Help people every chance you get. Use genuine compliments such as, ""You have a beautiful smile,"" ""You just made my day,"" ""You are too funny,"" and/or ""You're so smart!"" Don't gossip about anyone, because it shows whoever you would've gossiped to that you won't talk about them behind their backs., You don't want to be a stickler... especially if you are trying to attract someone. Try to be witty, quick, and funny but don't go too far with it. Don't overdo it (People might get annoyed and it's funnier if it's not expected/rare) and be very very careful not to hurt anyone's feelings. Make sure that you know who you're dealing with when joking around with people. Some people will take things too seriously or not think it's that funny., Don't ask other people to always help you do things that you can do yourself. Be energetic and be the first one to volunteer- whether it's taking someone's plate to the sink or answering a question in class., When someone says, ""Let's go see what's in that cave!"" respond with, ""I'm all for it!"" Don't act afraid of heights or the dark., When someone says,""Let's go on the roller coaster for the sixth time in a row,"" it's all right to say, ""You go ahead, I'm still recovering!"" and laugh kindly. If you push your limits with things, you could end up getting hurt or embarrassing yourself., Some guys like when a girl can be a little goofy and let a burp out every now and then; however, say excuse me afterwards and don't do it frequently. Burping and farting are things that can easily turn a guy off and prevent any attraction. Don't discuss them either. Be polite and say please and thank you. If you say their name when speaking to them it makes them feel more important., We all love talking about ourselves. Just remember that we have two ears and one mouth and that we have a mouth that closes and ears that don't. Guys love it when girls listen to what they are talking about and understand it. Talk about what he likes and what you have in common., Girls probably start to feel envious because you look great and act great and guys have a great time being around you. If they start making stupid, immature comments, just ignore it or say something back that is more mature and smart that will make that chick not talk to you again in a rude way. Know who your friends are and stick by them.

, Become friends with his friends (Don't ask too many questions or talk about him too much). Finding out what he's into and does and what you have in common (not in a stalker or creepy way) before starting a conversation will most likely help the conversation run smoothly. Or you could just save those questions to ask him., Don't script your conversations or have your friends type your texts to him., Shave your legs and armpits, ""do"" your eyebrows, don't forget to get rid of any facial hair, always have clean hair, brush your teeth and keep fresh breath (gum, mints), avoid acne (wash face, use acne medicine), wash off makeup from the night before, etc., Don't be a flirt or give your number out to a lot of guys. Be cool, calm, and relaxed around all guys and girls. Don't act awkward or seem uncomfortable. Be outgoing and talk to new people and make new friends often., Respect all adults and peers (children too). Say ""yes ma'am"" and ""yes sir"" to adults (only adults) but only when the time is appropriate so they don't think of it as a mockery. Let adults (and anyone) know that you respect them. When you disagree, be respectful and polite about it., Don't act flighty and/or ditsy. Be confident and use intelligent words (But don't overdo it). Don't think that guys are going to come after you, you have to be patient, but if that one guy is checking you out, make sure he is a good person and has good status so you don't get into trouble.

, You have to feel like you are a pretty and outstanding girl, because you are. By doing this, guys will start to feel it too.

, If you go around school ignoring anyone and looking unapproachable, people won't go up to you, and it is a turnoff for guys. You have to look like you are having a good time all the time, but when it is time to bring out your mature and serious time, bring it out. This will make guys think you are fun but controlled.

, You do not have to dress all glamorous and flashy to get attention. You can dress casually, like wearing regular jeans with a cute top. Or you can create your own personal style that will make you stand out, just make sure that your clothes fit and accentuate your curves. Make sure that they won't require adjusting all the time (straps, stretchy material slipping up, etc.), that will make you look fidgety and uncomfortable.

, If you feel out of place doing these steps, you don't have to do them, but if you want to give it a try go ahead. You need to believe if changing yourself, if you are totally opposite from this, it might not work, don't try it. It might take you a while to get these steps down, especially step one, but keep on trying if you want to go for it.

, Being a confident plus sized individual doesn't mean that you can't get a guys/girls attention. Just because a girl is jealous and tries to bring you down doesn't mean you should let her/him

Get out there!,
Be conscientious, social, and friendly.,
Spend time with people you admire.,
Be open to new experiences.,
Avoid anyone who looks down on others.",How to Find Your Ideal Partner1," There are plenty of other ways to meet new people. One of the best ways to do so is by participating in social activities you’re interested in anyway. For instance, start hitting that open mic night you’ve been tempted to check out. Weekly events are great, because you’ll start to recognize people, and vice versa. Even better: find a participatory social activity!


Join a co-ed sports team. Don’t worry about competitiveness, co-ed leagues are usually causal and fun-oriented. If you meet someone you’d like to get to know better, see if they want to grab a beverage after a game. If your nervous to ask them out, mention that everyone should go out together.
Start volunteering somewhere. There are organizations of all sorts that are always looking for volunteers. Pick an organization you’re impressed by that focuses on providing services or advocating for something you believe in. Not only will likely meet people with similar perspectives, people find compassion and selflessness attractive.
When you’re invited to any sort of social gathering, go!;
, People tend to pursue romance with those who are similar to themselves, but also different in certain key ways.Know that people tend to find conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness attractive.Relax. Be aware of your neurotic tendencies. We all have them. Learn not to externalize your stress and nervousness. This is important for your own peace of mind, and will also increase your attractiveness., Pay attention to what types of character traits you respect and the types of personalities you enjoy interacting with. Plus, hanging out with people you admire provides the chance to meet other people that you are likely to share interests or social circles with. Be sure to introduce yourself warmly to people you don’t know at social functions. Even if you are not romantically interested, this will build your social skills and send a message to others that you are confident and approachable.


Approach everyone you meet as though you’re thrilled to have the chance.
Actively listen to people when you first meet them, and enjoy the opportunity to learn about different types of people. There are more of us than we realize, and there’s plenty to learn from one another!
Maintain friendships with the people that particularly impress you.

, Know that curiosity and willingness to experience new things are a key component of our individual psychologies. Look for a partner that shares your level of adventure in pursuing new types of experiences.

, Superiority complexes prevent people from being able to contribute equally to mutually fulfilling relationships. If someone believes they’re a “better catch” than their partner, they will likely put less effort into maintaining the relationship. Don’t ever involve yourself with anyone who doesn’t believe you deserve them."

, At least hang out with the people he hangs out with. If he prefers to hang out by himself sometimes catch up and ask him questions, like ""what are you interests?"" simple things that will get him to notice you.

, Guys don't go for shy girls, because they know they are hard to meddle with. Remember to be always out there! Pop out! Like a pretty pony! Make others laugh, look cool, even be silly near your friends, all these things can pull attention. If he's serious, then be smart and act cool.

, Don't try to get into drama with him for attention, guys don't like that. Agree with him as much as you can, if he asks for your opinion, a yes or no question, nod and smile. There's no need to talk, that's the better way!

Look for a significant other or a best friend in new places or in places that tend to attract the kind of people who you are looking to meet or whose interests align with your own. For instance, if you're hoping to meet someone who enjoys the outdoors, join a hiking club.


If you have had bad luck with meeting others in bars or clubs, stay away from making connections in those places in particular.
You can also consider online dating. Avoid sites that have stigmas for being hookup apps, like Tinder. Try something that is taken a bit more seriously.;
, Once you begin this process, look for those who are cooperative, stable, honest, kind and secure. You will find that having a relationship with someone with those qualities will be much easier and more blissful. Stay away from those who are hotheaded, mean, or self-centered., Sometimes, when you are in a relationship or building a friendship, you might have a tendency to be overly modest or to downplay yourself. However, in doing so, you decrease your own value. Though you should stray away from bragging, you should still be sure to be honest about your positive traits and accomplishments, particularly if asked.Never dumb yourself down or pretend not to know something.
Share your recent accomplishments with your loved ones and celebrate when they achieve milestones, as well.

, As you are entering into a phase of newness with a friend or partner, you should always know your goals before beginning even the most initial levels of the relationship. If you are looking for marriage, you should accept that and make it known fairly early. If you are interested in a serious relationship, you should also make that known. Be honest with yourself and be honest with others.You don’t need to tell someone on the first date that you want to get married; but they should know that you are not dating for fun or to be casual.
You might say something like, “I’ve done the whole dating thing for a while and it’s fun but I’m looking for something more now. I’m dating to marry.” They will respect your honesty and you can avoid wasting time on those who are not looking to be serious.
If you are looking for a very close friend, communicate that, as well. This will help you avoid any confusion about your intentions.

, Perhaps you have met someone who you are developing strong feelings for. That’s great! However, do not forsake your better judgement based on your feelings alone. When you have made a truly good match, both your heart and your head will often align. You will not have to second guess it, change yourself, or compromise your core values. If you find yourself having to do that, then perhaps you should continue your search for love.Consider writing a pros and cons list and weighing both. In a relationship, the pros should always outweigh the cons.
If the list goes very clearly one way, try not to second guess over overthink it. For instance, if there are two or three items on the pro side and 15 on the con side, don't question whether or not you are being fair or if you should give the person a chance — move on.

, A person who is truly into you will not make you second guess that nor will they play games or play hard to get. If someone is not calling or texting you back, then chalk it up as a loss and move forward with your life. Only make an investment in someone who is working to also make an investment in you., In any relationship, you should set clear boundaries with your partner. Perhaps you find it okay to crack jokes on one another but not okay to name call. Or perhaps you don’t mind if your partner goes out on the town without you as long as they don’t accept drinks or dances from others. Whatever your limits are, you should communicate them to your partner openly and honestly.Recognize that boundaries are typically not something you can compromise on, as these are typically your limits.
If your partner cannot respect your boundaries, and your boundaries are reasonable, consider ending the relationship.
In a friendship, your friend might expect that you keep anything they tell you between the two of you.

, One of the biggest mistakes people make is investing too much of their life into their relationship. In order for true love to grow, you should always maintain some healthy distance and a healthy life outside of your partnership. Your partner will love and appreciate you more if they do not feel that they are the sole source of your happiness.Continue to maintain strong friendships and devote yourself to your work.
Explore some hobbies apart from your partner.

, In order to build a healthy relationship and develop unconditional love with your partner, you should ensure that you do your part in effective communication. When discussing any issues in your relationship, use “i” statements, rather than “you” statements, which can come off as accusatory. Don’t use your phone when they are talking or indulge in other distractions; give them your full attention.Be honest with one another and avoid lying.
Try to discuss issues as they happen and avoid going to bed upset. Do give one another some time to cool down, however.
Don’t interrupt or talk over your partner. Allow them space to speak.

Listen to hear, not to respond.

, Often in a relationship, compromise will be necessary. Recognize that any relationship is a process of social exchange, of constant give and take. Though you will be doing a lot of giving, you should still feel that you are happy and equal in the relationship and having your needs met. Talk about your issues and make negotiations and concessions where you can, still holding fast to your core values.For instance, perhaps you always go to a certain restaurant on Saturdays but your partner wants to try something new. A compromise would be for you to take turns picking the restaurant you go to on Saturdays or to go out separately or with friends.

, In order to receive unconditional love, you should also show this same level of love and kindness to your partner. Show love to them daily and do random acts of love and kindness for them often. You will find that deep and resounding love is a dual effort and that often, the more you put in, the more you will get out.Help them with a project they are working on or bring them lunch randomly one day.

, True love should be built on trust. If you do not have trust in your relationship, you cannot hope to have a dynamic that is healthy and secure. Trust and believe in your partner unless they give you a reason not to. Don’t snoop in their belongings or go on their phone without permission.If you have a question for your partner about something, ask them openly and directly.
Remember that love and trust go hand in hand.

, Unconditional love from another person will be hard to come by if you don’t love yourself first. Work on developing self love for yourself and you will find that unconditional love will flow naturally from that.Practice self care. Spend time on your hobbies. Take time out of your schedule every day for yourself.
If you struggle to prioritize your needs, consider finding a counselor to help you build your own unconditional love for yourself.

, In order to truly receive the love that you want, you must make sure to be your authentic self with your partner. Don’t mute or limit yourself in anyway; express your emotions and your thoughts in ways that are constructive and healthy. Continue to spend time with family and friends and do all the other things that you enjoy., Unconditional love thrives when the two partners in the relationship feel that they can be completely and totally themselves. Do not try to change your partner in any drastic way.Accept them as they are.


Allow your partner to be themselves. Tell them how their behavior makes you feel, but don’t try to control them. If they are listening to you, they will likely make the change themselves.

, Sometimes, you might feel the tendency to shut down emotionally when your partner tries to show you love and affection. You may feel that the relationship is moving too fast or that you are fearful of the future. However, in order to receive a deeper level of love from your partner, you must not shun them. Accept and return their love and affection.Don’t turn away their affection or acts of kindness. Instead, focus on showing them how much you appreciate them.

, At the end of the day, though love is truly wonderful, remember that you need more than that to have a successful relationship with someone. Even if the love that you feel for them and that they feel for you are unconditional, know that a relationship does in fact have core conditions. For instance, you should always expect fidelity and respect in your union. If those are absent, then love is not enough."

Flirt with him.,
Start the conversation.,
Ask him on a date.,
Be yourself.,
Keep your cool when he is around.,
Continue to have your own interests and life when you date.,
Use your list.,
Do not give up.,
Get to know him well.,
Have realistic expectations.",How to Get the Man of Your Dreams1," Flirting is a good way to get a man's attention and to let him know that you are interested. Making eye contact for several seconds, smiling, giving compliments, leaning forward when talking, and mimicking his body language are all ways.People flirt in different ways. Whatever method you use, be the most fun version of yourself and project confidence.Always face him when you talk to him and avoid crossing your arms or legs. If he says something funny, lightly touch his arm or his knee when you laugh.;
, You may be nervous when you meet a new man or come across someone that you are really attracted to. Think of some questions you can ask to start the conversation. If you have some questions ready, you will appear more confident. Try to ask open-ended questions that get the conversation going. Try asking him:What is your favorite book?
What do you like to do in your free time?
What is the best vacation you have ever been on?
If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money?
If you had a dinner party, what three guests (dead or alive) would you invite?

, You do not have to wait for a man to ask you out. There is nothing wrong with being proactive and going after a man you are interested in. Avoid saying, ""Do you want to hang out?"" It is better to be clear that you are interested and suggest a specific activity instead.


You can keep the date light and casual and ask him, ""Hey do you want to grab coffee one day?"" or ""Do you want to check out this new exhibit on Saturday?""
Ask him what he did this past weekend and suggest you do some activity that is similar. This way your date is based on something that the both of you are interested in.If you chicken out, you can drop a really strong hint. Try saying, ""Have you heard about this new restaurant? I can't wait to check it out. I heard the ___ is amazing.""If you do not feel comfortable asking him out on a solo date, invite him out with you and your friends. If you go this route, make sure you flirt and give him extra attention.

, Do not compromise yourself when you are dating. You should never have to change your beliefs, goals, or values for a man.If the man does not accept you for who you are, he is not the man of your dreams. Be honest about who you are and communicate your wants and needs.


The goal is to find a man who loves you for the person that you are. If you change yourself to get a man to like you, you will not be happy in the end.
Men like a partner who is confident. The little quirks that you may not feel great about are the same things a man may find unique and attractive.

, It is not uncommon to be shy or nervous around a man that you are interested in. Try not to over think things. Keep every date and interaction with the guy in perspective.Remind yourself that it is only a date or a conversation, not a life or death situation.
If you can control where you interact with the guy, choose an environment where you are comfortable. Choose a restaurant that you know or a coffee shop that you like.
Be prepared with interesting things you can talk about. Have a funny story or a few current events that you can bring up.

, It can be easy to get so focused on dating that you neglect other aspects of your life. This is especially hard if you have met a man that you really like and love spending time with. Never lose sight of the things that make you the person you are.


Write down some short and long term goals that have nothing to do with a man. Is there a career move you want to take or a place you would like to visit?
Spend time away from your phone. It is easy to be connected to people with your phone all of the time. If you are dating someone, do not text or chat with them constantly. Time apart is healthy for both you and the man you are dating.
Continue to make time for your friends. If you have plans with someone, tell your date that you have plans with a friend and suggest another time to get together.

, As you meet men, evaluate them to see if they have the qualities that you desire. If you notice a deal breaker, stop dating the person and move on. You do not want to waste your time on someone who you will not be happy with.


Keep in mind the difference between your wants and needs. You may be able to compromise on a want. For example, a person may live and hour and a half away, but you initially wanted to date someone who lives close to you. You may be willing to compromise on this issue if the man has a lot of other good qualities.
Your list may evolve as you are dating. You may find that the things you thought were important were not or you may be open to something.
As you date, you will learn more about yourself and your likes and your dislikes.

, It takes time to meet the man of your dreams. Every man you meet or go on a date with will not be a good match. Be patient and try not to get frustrated. Know that there is a good man out there for you. You never know when you will meet him.It is natural to become disappointed when you meet someone that is not for you. Just think of that person as a stepping stone to the man of your dreams.
Remember that you are not a failure. Finding a mate is not an easy task.

, You will not know if he is the man of your dreams until you truly get to know him and see if you two are compatible. Take the time to meet his family, friends, and coworkers. Pay attention to see if his words and his actions match. See if your values match.It takes time to get to know someone. Spend time with him in different settings and scenarios to see different sides of his personality. You may not initially recognize that he is the man of your dreams.

, No one is perfect. Even though he is your dream man, there may still be things about him that you find annoying.You have to accept him for the man he is today. If you find yourself focusing more on his potential and the man he could become, he may not be the best fit for you.


Do not compare your relationship or dating life to what you see in television and movies. These often create unrealistic depictions of love and relationships.Also be open-minded. The man of your dreams may come in a slightly different package than you imagined.

Understand how to read body language.,
Examine the other person’s body positioning.,
Observe their physical responses to you.",How to Find out if Someone Loves You1," Humans communicate a lot without saying a word, and body language is a significant part of that communication. Most body language connected to physical and romantic attraction give off two basic signals: “I’m available” and “I’m interested.” Here are some signals that your special someone is really into you:Smiling (especially smiles that involve the muscles near the eyes as well as those around the mouth)
Maintaining eye contact
“Intimate” eye gazing (moving their gaze from your eyes to your lips or other erotic areas)Relaxed, uncrossed legs and arms
Leaning in toward you
Tilting the head while listening or talking;
, How a person holds themselves around you can indicate how comfortable they are with you, as well as how much they want to impress you.


When men want to impress someone or appear more powerful, they take up more space physically. If he’s sitting his with legs spread far apart or standing with his shoulders held back and squared, he probably wants to look impressive to you.
When a man or woman’s legs and feet are turned towards you, it’s a good sign that they’re comfortable and happy with the interaction and don’t want to go anywhere.If their torso is turned towards you but their legs are turned away, they may not be feeling comfortable or happy with how things are going.
When people are comfortable with someone, they are more physically open to that person. For example, your significant other might frequently sit or stand with the front of their body turned towards you if s/he likes you, whereas if you’re at a party and see someone you don’t like, you’ll subconsciously turn away from them., When humans find someone attractive, their bodies automatically display that attraction through a variety of physical responses. Knowing what to look for can help you understand how attractive your significant other thinks you are.


Flushed cheeks suggest sexual excitement. (In fact, this is why some women wear blush.) Flushing may also occur on the neck and chest during arousal. However, some people may also flush when they’re feeling shy or uncomfortable, so this shouldn’t be your only cue.Lips become redder and plumper when someone’s aroused. If your significant other licks their lips when they’re around you, they may be subconsciously (or even consciously) signaling you that they’re interested in a kiss.People tend to touch their face, hair, or body when they’re in the presence of a person they’re attracted to. Twirling hair, flicking the tongue, or someone touching their face or neck with their fingertips are all signs of attraction."
"
Cooperate more than compromise.,
Forget the phrase “ideal type”.,
Know what really matters to you.,
Weigh the importance of having similar worldviews.,
Do more than digi-date.,
Be patient.",How to Find Your Ideal Partner2," Leave it to the intellectuals that study romance to coin a painfully unromantic phrase like “functional harmony”.Translating their findings into operable advice: Look for compatibility, not compromise. While compromise is always necessary in any type of relationship, it cannot be the basis of a deeply gratifying romantic partnership.


Too many compromises, even in a respectful and affectionate relationship, will leave you or your partner wondering about other romantic endeavors. Demand more than attraction and compromise from your relationships, and you’ll wind up happier.

, Realize that the strength and enjoyment derived from your relationships with other human beings has little to do with their most apparent traits, especially physical traits. Don’t waste time searching for an ideal partner. Search for another person with whom you can share an ideal relationship.


Do not let popular conceptions of ideal romantic partners effect the assumptions you make about who will be your ideal partner. Recognize that your assessment of a potential partner is unique to who you are.There’s beauty in this: your ideal relationship is the product of what you and your partner alone determine.

, While shared interests and mutual attraction might get the ball rolling, what will lead to a stable, fulfilling relationship? Research indicates that our determination of potential romantic partners, and even our desire for a particular person, depends less on surface-level characteristics the more time we spend with them.The more you get to know someone, the more the deeper stuff matters. Pay attention to these characteristics to get an idea of whether you and someone you’re interested in might make an ideal partnership:


Sense of humor. More than just an important part of your first date, a potential partner’s sense of humor can say a lot about the type of person they are. If you tend to be amused by the same sort of wit, or simply laugh at similar scenarios, take this is a very good sign.
Financial stability. Not a fun topic, but it matters immensely in long term partnerships. Look for someone who handles their finances similar to the way you do – or even better, so long as you’re willing to step up your financial maturity as well.
Spirituality. This is an incredibly meaningful aspect of many peoples’ identity. Some people view religious practice as an essential aspect of their lives. Some prefer to let science and reason entirely dictate their understanding of the world. Be aware of someone’s spirituality, especially if it is an important part of their lifestyle or worldview.

, Our feelings about the world around us – even about existence itself – matter immensely to our personalities and behavior. Understanding reality in similar ways can predict strong relationships as well. Recognize that psychological similarity – literally thinking like one another – makes for happy, healthy relationships.People who have comparably positive outlooks regarding immeasurable concepts (such as whether or not they consider themselves lucky) tend to gravitate towards one another and end up in fulfilling romantic partnerships. That can’t be all luck.

, Dating apps are a great way to meet people. In fact, 5% of Americans currently in marriages or long-term relationships met online.Just don’t expect a cute profile photo and a witty blurb to translate into romantic bliss. It has happened, and will again, but do not let online dating experiences dictate your feelings about yourself or the type of relationship you’re looking for.

, The next hand you shake may fit perfectly in your palm, the next stranger sitting beside you on a train might make your day with a polite compliment, and the human that’s been looking for exactly the sort of ideal relationship you want to be a part of might accidentally lock their bike to yours tomorrow. Be patient, but be excited!

Think (and talk) about what you want.,
Grow independently to grow together.,
Appreciate the love your partner shares with you.,
Allow yourself to love completely.",How to Find Your Ideal Partner3," Decide if you’d prefer to be in an explicitly dating-oriented relationship, as opposed to a long term, deeply-committed relationship. Your ideal partner for each of these scenarios will slightly differ.


If you’re seeing someone, talk with your partner about the type of relationship you each want. This may lead to productive growth between you, or important conversations about different perspectives that you should both be aware of.

, Continue to pursue activities that interest you independently when you’re seeing someone. Pursue activities together in which you each have independent interests. Allow one another the freedom to pursue personal interests. Counter-intuitively, this will diminish the potentially detrimental effects of inevitable differences between your individual identities.


If you’re both working towards bettering your own happiness, and support one another in doing so, you’ll likely enjoy a happy relationship together.
Vocalize the fact that you’re glad that you’re both comfortable with having separate interests.
Enjoy one another’s self-contentment. Let the relationship you share together validate who each of you are as individuals. A romantic relationship will provide a shared sense of satisfaction if it empowers both of you to be even happier because you’re together.

, An ideal partnership will only last if you can easily relate to one another, and continue to be comfortable together. Recognize the value of spending time with those who seems to grasp and appreciate your approach to everyday life. This sort of natural compatibility supersedes any specific features that you may overinflate – either positively or negatively – in a relationship that lacks this unspoken admiration for one another’s way of living.Tell your partner that you’re immeasurably happy to be a part of their life, and that you’re equally thrilled that they’re a part of yours.

, This is harder (and much less cheesy) than it sounds. Profound romantic connection is an incredibly exciting experience. It requires physical attraction, intellectual admiration, and an often inexplicable contentment in one another’s presence.Be fully conscious of the way you feel while you’re developing a healthy, mutually-fulfilling romantic bond. There are few experiences in life that compare to sharing a partnership that empowers and enables two people to love each other completely. This will be most evident in unexpected moments of nonsensical joy. Enjoy them!

Leave a little mystery when you dress.,
Wear red.,
Amplify your pheromones with the right scent.,
Relax your movements.,
Make eye contact.,
Repeat after him.,
Utilize the power of touch.,
Challenge him.,
Give him an opportunity to approach you.,
Compliment him.You can compliment something about his appearance or you can wait until the conversation progresses and you're able to compliment something about his personality.,
Keep it light and keep it brief.,
Demonstrate ""open"" body language.",How to Get a Man's Attention," Your clothes should highlight your best features without putting everything on display. Showing just a hint of your feminine charm can tease him into imagining more.


Revealing clothes are not necessarily the sexiest option. Instead, focus on playing up your best features. . The shape and material of the clothing should work with your natural curves, drawing attention to all the right places.
Showing a little skin can also be effective, but the key idea is to leave more to the imagination than what you show. Pick out one revealing garment and balance it out with clothes that offer more coverage. For instance, wear a low-cut blouse with a knee-length or longer skirt. If you wear a blouse with a low back, make sure that your chest and legs are covered. When you opt for a mini skirt, keep your bust behind a blouse with a full neckline.;
, Studies suggest that the color red can make women look more attractive to men more than any other color can.


Some theories suggest that red is a naturally stimulating color. Others suggest that the link between the color red and sexuality is a learned behavior. Either way, multiple studies have suggested that red definitely has a positive effect when it comes to getting a man's attention.As with most things, less is more. Instead of dressing in bright red from head to toe, mix a little red into your outfit. Wear a red dress with black shoes or red shoes with a black dress, but avoid wearing a red dress with a red shoe.

, A little perfume can go a long way, especially when you choose the right scent. Scent can trigger attraction on an instinctual level.


Certain fragrances are believed to be more sensual than others. Traditionally, these scents include sandalwood, rose, ylang ylang, jasmine, and patchouli.Use a small dab or spray of perfume and only apply it to your pulse points. These points are located at your wrists, behind your ears, in the bend of your elbow, behind your knees, and on the inside of your ankles.

, Slow, smooth movements can make you appear more confident, more feminine, and more sensual. When you know he's looking in your direction, put a little extra effort into looking a little more graceful.


Mind your posture and keep your back straight. Doing this demonstrates an appealing level of confidence while subtly flattering your chest.
If you're at a club, party, or similar event, consider dancing at a time you know he can watch. Dancing can be a very sensual action. It also conveys confidence and a fun-loving nature.
Try not to look jumpy or intimidated, even if you actually feel really nervous. You don't need to sit in the same spot the entire time, but maintain a relatively fixed position to demonstrate a calm, relaxed, and confident attitude., Once your eyes do meet his, you also need to show him a smile. Eye contact lets a man know that you're interested in him, but the smile is what lets him know that your interest is a positive one.


To maximize the effect further, start by making a few sidelong glances in his direction.
After a couple of these, look at him directly.
As soon as he looks back, though, lower your eyes and show a coy, embarrassed smile.
Slowly drag your eyes back up to his after a few moments. Continue to smile.
Break eye contact and look away completely for a few minutes. Repeat the process again, as needed, to convey your interest.

, Mimic his body language. When he sips from his drink, sip from yours. If he tilts his head, tilt yours, too.


Your behavior can relate to his without directly repeating it. For example, if he gets another drink and your glass is still full, hold up your glass in a quick ""cheers"" pose before taking a sip. Doing so acknowledges his action and clues him into the fact that you're paying attention.

, When women are interested in a man, they naturally begin to play with their hair and touch themselves in other similar ways. You can use these types of actions to indirectly convey your interest to a man.


Play with your hair. Twirl in between your fingers or run your fingers through it in an absent-minded manner.
Run your fingers over your neck and shoulders.
Wet or nibble on your lips, but try not to be obvious about it.

, If the man you have your eye on still hasn't made a move, take a step back and give him the chance to chase after you. After making your interest obvious for a few minutes, stop and act like your interest is declining. Let a few more minutes pass by before turning his way again.

, Don't look busy. If a man thinks that you're waiting for someone or preoccupied by something else, he's less likely to look your way.


In fact, it can be a good idea to look bored—when you're not looking at him, of course. Play around with a pen or glass. Keep your attention off your phone and out of a book. Look around idly and without focusing on much of anything.
Some men might need a little more encouragement. Give him the opportunity to talk to you by positioning yourself closer and standing alone. Walk by him on your way to the restroom or bar. You can even lightly bump shoulders with him and apologize with a coy grin.

, Either way, honest flattery can make him feel good about himself and about the person offering it.


Make sure that the compliments you offer are sincere.
If you have a hard time verbalizing a convincing compliment, you can compliment him indirectly. A good way to do this is by laughing at his jokes.
An even simpler way to compliment a man is to pay attention to what he says. Reply back with responses that make sense. Every so often, return to something he mentioned earlier in the conversation just to show that you found it interesting enough to remember.

, Avoid topics that seem heavy, dull, or depressing. Stick with fairly lighthearted subjects, especially those that allow your comments to be easily summarized.


A first meeting is not the time to tell him your life story, your past relationship woes, or your deepest fears. It's also not the right time to complain about work or your childhood.You can, however, mention your dreams or share humorous, short tales from your past or present. Choose topics that will leave you both in a good mood. Limit any stories you have to under a minute. If he wants to know more, he can ask.
This does not, however, mean that you should try to act dumb. On the contrary, be as clever as the conversation allows. You don't need to be a brain surgeon, but you'll hold is attention much better if you can keep up with what he's saying instead of pretending to be oblivious.

, Nonverbal communication is just as important as verbal communication. Situate yourself so that you appear open to the man's advances. If he thinks that you're shrinking back from him, his attention is likely to waver.


Face him directly and occasionally lean forward in his direction.
Keep your hands unclenched and your arms open. Avoid crossing your arms during the conversation.
Find an excuse to touch him. You can ""accidentally"" touch his hand in the middle of the conversation or casually touch his shoulder when he makes an interesting remark.

Visit places where men you are interested in may be.,
Tell your family and friends you are looking.,
Try online dating.,
Use multiple methods.",How to Get the Man of Your Dreams2," You cannot sit at home and expect to meet the man of your dreams. Going places where men are will help you increase your chances of meeting someone. Think about the values and qualities that are important to you and go places where you are likely to meet those type of men.If you want a man that cares about the community, go volunteer for a charity organization.
If you want a man that is an animal lover, visit a dog park or animal shelter.
If you are interested in a man of a certain religion, visit a church, mosque, or temple that is in line with your beliefs.
If you are into art, visit art galleries and art shows.
If you have a specific man in mind, go places where you know he likes to hang out.

, Tell people that you are single and are trying to meet someone. Let them know the kind of man that you are looking for. Ask them if they know of any single men that might be a good fit for you. Your friends know you well and can help you find a good mate.If your friends know of someone, ask them to introduce you to the person in a group setting. A group dinner or a group activity can help you get a feel for the person.
If you are feeling bold, have your friends set you up on a blind date.
If you have a specific person in mind, find out if he is single and ask for an introduction.

, Online dating is great way to meet people that you may never come across in your every day life. Choose a dating site that fits your needs. For example, if you are Jewish and you want to meet other Jewish people, you could try jDate. If you are gay, try a dating site that caters to your community.Be honest on your dating profile and use up-to-date pictures.
Be specific when you are looking through profiles. If you are looking for men in a certain age range or geographical area, filter your search to these criteria.
Don't be afraid to send a message to the guy first.

, The more you put yourself out there, the more likely you are to meet the type of man you are looking for. Do not rely on a single method to meet someone. You can online date and try to meet people in person at the same time.


Also vary the places that you visit. For example, do not go to your favorite hangout every Friday night where everyone already knows you. Try somewhere new instead. This may introduce you to people you have not seen before.
You should also spend time with different groups of people. Hanging out with different people can showcase different parts of your personality. For example, you are probably different with your coworkers than you are with your best friends."

List the traits you desire in a partner.,
Identify your deal breakers.,
Think about your past relationships.",How to Get the Man of Your Dreams3," Before you can get the man of your dreams, you need to know what you are looking for. Take some time and write down the qualities that you are looking for. These qualities can include character traits, education level, occupation, values, physical traits, etc.Go through your list and separate your wants from your needs. For example, you may want a man that is 6'2"" that is kind and has a good sense of humor. Being kind and having a good sense of humor are more of a need. While having a very tall man is something you want, but is not a trait that will keep you from having a successful relationship.
You can also talk with your friends and family that know you well. They can help you identify essential qualities that your potential partner should have.
This list may change and evolve over time. Continue to revise the list based on where you are in life.

, Knowing your deal breakers will help you weed out men who are not quite what you are looking for. Think of the things that you absolutely cannot deal with and are not willing to compromise on. Deal breakers are different for each person. By understanding yourself and the type of man you want, you will be able to know your limits. Ask yourself some questions to help you decide.What things are you immediately turned off by?
How do you spend your time and money? If you are frugal and like to save a lot of money, a man who is a frivolous spender may be a deal breaker.
What behaviors (e.g. lying, bad hygiene, laziness) are not acceptable for you to engage in? These may also be unacceptable for your man.
What qualities do you value the most in your friends and family members? Exhibiting the opposite of these qualities may be a deal breaker for you. For example, if you value a laid back personality, someone who is extremely uptight may not work for you.

, Your past relationships can provide great insight and prepare you for your next relationship. Past relationships include both your romantic relationships and familial relationships. You may carry patterns and behaviors from these relationships into your new relationships. These behaviors can be both good and bad. Write down the good things that you would like to have going forward and the things that you want to leave behind.


Think about how you handle conflict and problem solve in your relationships.
How do you express anger?
How did you deal with unmet expectations within a relationship?

Assess what you bring to the table.,
Identify areas that need improvement.,
Work on your shortcomings.,
Decide if you are ready for a relationship.,
Take pride in your appearance.",How to Get the Man of Your Dreams4," In addition to knowing what you want, list the qualities that a man may find attractive about you. Are you funny? Are you confident? Do you have a beautiful smile? Are you supportive? Recognize your strengths and know that you have something to offer.Knowing your strengths will also help you project confidence. This is key as men are attracted to confidence.

, Everyone has strengths and areas that need improvement. No one is perfect and both you and your potential partner will have shortcomings. Are you impatient? Do you have trouble compromising? Are you selfish?This can be a difficult list to create, but be honest with yourself.
If you feel comfortable, you can ask people that you have dated in the past about some of your shortcomings. They can offer some valuable feedback.

, You do not need to have everything together before you get with the man of your dreams, but you should be taking steps to improve yourself. There are many different methods to improve yourself such as reading self-help books, working with a therapist, taking a class, or setting goals and working towards them.Use whatever methods that will help you become the person that you want to be.
Also consider the areas that will help you attract the kind of man that you want. For example, if you want a man that is super fit and healthy, you may need to step up your healthy eating and exercise to be more attractive to him.
Remember that personal improvement is something you do for yourself not a man. Think of getting your dream man as an added bonus.

, Take time to examine your life and see if you are truly ready to meet the man of your dreams and be in a relationship. Are you still hurt or bitter about a past relationship? Do you have time to invest in the relationship? Are you willing to make room in your life for this man?If you are not ready, a relationship with the man of your dreams may not work out.
Before you can start with someone new, you must resolve all of your past relationship issues. You will not be able to start something new if you are not over your past.

, Men are visual creatures and your physical attractiveness will catch their attention at first.Your looks will not keep a man around, but can help you attract men. Think of your appearance as one tool in your it.


Everyone is not a supermodel or a beauty queen, but everyone possesses beauty.
Take good care of yourself by eating well and exercising. Wear clothes that make you look and feel attractive. Take care of your skin, teeth, and nails. Wear makeup that enhances your best features.

Consider how well you know other people in their life.",How to Find out if Someone Loves You2," Physical affection helps individuals feel loved, appreciated, and understood. But intimacy can be demonstrated through more than just sex. Frequent displays of physical affection, such as cuddling on the couch, a morning hug, or resting a hand on your leg at the movies, are good signs that your significant other feels very close to you.A study by Brigham Young University psychologists suggests there are 7 basic types of physical affection (separate from sexual intercourse): backrubs/massages, caressing/stroking, cuddling/holding, hugging, holding hands, kissing on the mouth, and kissing on the face.Couples who engaged in these acts frequently rated themselves as resolving conflicts more quickly and easily and feeling more satisfied in their relationships.

, If you’re like most people and have very busy lives, the two of you probably can’t spend every moment together. However, if your significant other actively arranges for you to spend time together, whether it’s an elaborate weekend getaway or grabbing a quick workday lunch together, it’s a good bet they enjoy investing time and energy into your relationship -- a sure sign of love., A person who loves you will try to make your life easier when they can. These helpful gestures don’t have to be huge; offering to run to the drugstore for you when you’re sick may not seem super romantic, but it shows a level of care and attachment that indicates your significant other really cares about you.

, Compromise is a necessity for long-lasting love. If the other person is willing to give up on the idea of being ”right” sometimes, they probably care about maintaining their relationship with you more than they care about their ego.The other person offering to do things that they really don’t enjoy is a particularly good sign that they’re crazy about you. If your significant other really hates parties but is willing to go to your office Christmas party with you because they know it will make you happy, it’s a pretty good bet they truly love you.

, Research shows that individuals who rate highly on feeling “in love” with another person usually want to know where that person is and what they’re doing, not out of a lack of trust but because they’re interested in the other person’s life. People in love also spend significant amounts of time thinking about the person they’re in love with when they’re apart.If your significant other routinely checks in throughout the day to ask you what’s up or what you’re doing, it’s a good sign that they feel attached to you.


There’s a difference between feeling attached and being controlling. If your significant other demands to know where you are at all times, refuses to let you go places without him/her, or expresses distrust of your friends, these may be warning signs of a larger relationship issue., If your significant other is in love with you, they will probably want you to be involved with the other people who are important to them. Meeting your significant other's family and hanging out with their friends are excellent signs that your relationship is more than casual.The flip-side of this is how well they know your friends and family. if they seem interested in meeting the people closest to you, they’re probably in it for the long haul.

Think about how much of themselves they reveal.,
Reminisce about your past experiences together.,
Notice whether the person talks about your future together.,
Determine whether you feel that your views are respected.,
See whether they ask you about your life.,
Notice how often they express positive thoughts about you.,
Tell them you love them.",How to Find out if Someone Loves You3," Vulnerability can be terrifying, but it’s crucial to any kind of meaningful connection.If your significant other is honest and direct with you about their ideas, hopes, and needs, they trust and value you enough to accept being vulnerable with you.


Quantity is less important than quality. Some people are naturally more shy and reserved than others. However, if your significant other shares with you ideas or thoughts that are deeply personal and important to them, this is a sign that they want you to know the “real” them.

, Research has shown that couples who spend time reminiscing about the good times they’ve enjoyed together have stronger ties than those who don’t.If your significant other routinely brings up happy memories of times they spent with you, it’s a good sign that you and the experiences you’ve shared together are important and positive to them.

, One great sign that your significant other is totally in love with you is that they talk about your future together as though it’s a given. Perhaps they suggest a great vacation destination for the two of you to check out next year, or maybe they bring up things such as wondering what your children would look like. Talking like this means that the other person thinks of you together and expects to be around for awhile.


They may not immediately jump to talking about your plans for a wedding or children. Nevertheless, even making small plans for the two of you together suggests that the other person likes the idea of you being a couple and wants things to stay that way.

, Opposites may very well attract, but it’s still possible -- and important -- for partners to hold very different views and still respect each other.If you feel like your significant other expresses respect and understanding for your beliefs, even if they disagree with them, it’s a good sign that your significant other values you -- just as you are.Because miscommunications are bound to occur in relationships, your significant other may truly love you and still end up belittling your beliefs at times. However, this should be a rare mistake, not something that occurs every day. When you express that your feelings were hurt, your significant other should apologize and make an effort to avoid that behavior in the future.

, Someone who loves you will be interested in your life, your ideas, and even little stuff like how your day went. Whether it’s checking in with you to ask how that big meeting went or asking what your big life goals are, if your significant other routinely asks you about you, they’re probably head-over-heels for you.

, An excellent sign of whether the other person is really in love with you is how often they focus on your good qualities rather than the bad ones (and we’ve all got a few). If your significant other frequently talks about how attractive they think you are, how much they like your sense of humor, or how interesting they think your ideas are, it’s a good sign for the future. On the other hand, if you feel frequently blamed, criticized, or shamed by your significant other, there are probably issues in your relationship that need to be resolved -- even if the other person says they love you., This may seem obvious, but it can be scary to be the one to take the first plunge. However, if the other person really cares about you, they’ll appreciate your honesty even if they don’t feel the same way. You can get a good sense of how someone feels about you by observing how someone treats you and talks with you, but until you step up and declare how you really feel, you won’t have the chance to hear whether they return your love.


Be confident! Research shows that both men and women are more considered attractive when they’re confident and comfortable with themselves.Be yourself, be honest, and you may just find the love of your life.
Be direct. Research has shown that people, especially men, prefer direct approaches to hedging around what you want to say in relationships.If you try to drop a lot of hints but never say “I love you,” you may not signal the other person that it’s safe for them to say they love you.

Before you can expect someone else to accept you, though, you must know what “self” you are projecting. You might start by writing down the answers to these questions. Your answers will help paint a picture of the “you” you are offering to your potential partner.


What are your best qualities?
What do you like to do with your time?
What do you love about yourself?
What would you like to work on?
What makes you feel uncomfortable?;
, Whether you are an introvert or an extrovert, a hilarious crowd pleaser or a very kind friend, be confident about what you have to offer someone else. When it comes to finding love, there is no right personality type, no special trait that will get you ahead. Contrary to what you might see in romantic comedies and sitcoms, everyone has a shot at love - not just the most popular or conventionally attractive among us. So know what you have, and own it.

, Part of knowing yourself is knowing your relationship needs. Writing down what you consider to be the most important traits of your potential partner is a good way to figure out what you actually mean when you say you’re looking for love.


Try not to be too specific with this list of traits. For instance, instead of saying “six feet tall, brown hair, dark eyes,” focus on personality traits that matter to you. Do you want someone who’s honest to a fault? Someone who shares your passion for books?
It may also be helpful to write down a list of definite “no’s.” For example, you might not want a partner who travels six months out of the year, or someone who doesn’t get along with your family.
Remember that the point here is not to craft a projection of your future partner; you’re just sketching out the basic qualities you’d enjoy having in a partner so you can understand your own needs better. Chances are, the person you end up loving will only have a few of the qualities on your list.

, One of the best ways to do this is to start by making friends. It is always said that making friends is the surest way to finding love, and that’s because it’s true; it’s a great way to build a mutual relationship based on caring and trust. When you’re making friends, keep these tips in mind:


Don’t be judgmental. This is probably the most important rule when it comes to the beginnings of friendship and love. If you can’t get past someone’s dorky haircut, you’ll never know how well you would have gotten along with that person. The attraction doesn’t always have to be there the first time you meet someone.
Be generous with your time. Making friends requires a bit of commitment. If you’re serious about finding love, get serious about spending time with people. Accept invitations to parties, sporting events, and concerts. If you aren’t much of a joiner, ask a few people out for lunch or coffee. The point is to create a lot of situations that give you the chance to get to know people - and it’s hard to do that from home.

, This doesn’t mean you need to shout to the rooftops that you’re on a quest for love, but take measures to make sure people know you’re available and willing to take things further if the opportunity arises.


Consider your appearance. When you’re looking for love, dress like the best version of yourself. Don’t force yourself into a style or look that makes you feel uncomfortable. Instead, project your confidence and uniqueness with clean, well-styled clothes and a pleasant expression on your face. The addition of a little perfume or cologne also helps to send out the right kind of signal.
Be an attentive and encouraging listener. If you find someone interesting, ask a lot of questions. Next time you see that person, follow up by recalling something he or she said and mentioning it at the beginning of the conversation. Show people you care about them.
Be honest and sincere. In other words, be yourself. Willingness to present yourself to the world as you are is an act of courage, and that’s attractive.

, Consider online dating, for example. Using an online dating network is a great way to find out who is available in your area. However, don’t fall into the trap of being too picky, or judging everyone by their profile picture. If you want to find love, you’ll have to give people a chance - the same chance you’d want them to give you.


Joining a singles group at your religious center or school can help you circulate with other people who share your mindset.
Bars and clubs are popular places to look for love, but if you want to find a longer-term relationship, you might find it easier to get to know people in places that facilitate conversation.

, When you've found someone who interests you and you’re ready to move from the “friend” stage to something deeper, try asking the person you’re interested in out on a date.


Try going with the classic date night: ask someone out to dinner. This will probably flatter your date and facilitate great conversation.
Don’t put too much pressure on the format of the date - just focus on having a good time. Joke around and make your date feel good - the goal is to have fun!
Think about whether you’d like to keep seeing this person. Does he or she seem to meet your most important needs? Is there a mutual attraction? If so, make plans to do something else together. If things keep going well, your relationship may take a deeper turn from here.

, Try to be in tune with what the other person wants.


Don’t be too pushy. Remember that everyone is dealing with insecurities and personal issues, and sometimes signals just get mixed. Try not to take things too personally at this early stage.
Texting and other forms of messaging may be the simplest ways to communicate, but you’re less likely to give each other the wrong impression in person, or even over the phone. Move things along with face to face interaction.

, At a certain point in the quest for love, it’s time to take a risk and lay yourself open to the person you care about. Tell her or him what you’re feeling. It may make you a little uncomfortable, but the only way to know whether this relationship is turning into love is to find out if the feeling is mutual.


If the person is interested in continuing the relationship with you, you may be on your way to finding love. Love is built on affection, trust, attraction, mutual regard - and it all starts with people agreeing that they both want to pursue it. You'll know you've attained it when you find you care about your partner on a deep, unselfish level, and that you probably always will.
If there’s a lack of interest on the other side, it’s important to know when to drop it and move on. Unrequited love isn’t what you set out to find.

, If a relationship you felt was leading to love doesn’t work out, you may feel hurt for a very long time. It’s important to eventually try again. When you do connect with someone special, it will be worth the heartache you experienced on the journey.

However, there are other ways to say, ""I love you,"" simply by switching up the language you use. For example, instead of saying the three words, “I love you,” you could say other meaningful things like, “I’m really happy you’re in my life,” or “I feel lucky that I have you,” or “I love you for being you.These different expressions offer some variety by giving specifics as to why you love your partner, and give a breath of fresh air in expressing those three little words.;
, Sharing your feelings to your partner about the positive impact they have on your life is a clear way of showing the love and value you have for your partner. For instance, if your partner makes spending time with your family easier, let them know that they make that interaction easier for you. If you have a bad day at work, and the moment you see your partner you instantly feel a wave of relief, let them know that just seeing them immediately puts you in a better mood.


If your loved one makes your life better or easier, communicating their influence on making your life richer, lets them know they are wanted, valued, and loved.

, Being vulnerable means expressing your thoughts and feelings wholeheartedly, without reserve. With that expression, comes the possibility of being criticized, hurt, rejected, etc. by your loved one. The important thing to remember is if you love someone, you opening up and wholeheartedly sharing yourself, expresses to your partner that them knowing the real you is worth the risk of you getting hurt. It is you making a self-sacrifice of security, for a deeper connection with them.


Since sacrificing anything is not easy, being vulnerable with the one you love shows your commitment to the relationship.

, Wanting advice from your partner communicates that you respect their opinion. It means you look to them for a sort of guidance, and it strengthens their understanding of their role in your life.which is a step in making your relationship stronger.


It doesn't have to be something serious, although it can be. Just letting your partner know that you are interested in their opinion, and want to know how they would approach something allows them to see the respect you have for them.

, If your partner is obviously nervous, upset, worried, or concerned about something, ask them to vent and share their feelings to you. Let your partner know that you want them to be able to let their guard down and spill what is on their mind. Sometimes, people just need have a rant about what is bothering them. Let your partner know that you are there to listen to what they have to say.


It shows your loved one that they can just let loose about how they are feeling, and you are there to be their outlet and listener.
While they’re expressing their feelings to you, make sure you are completely there and in the moment. This means refraining from looking at your phone or any other kind of distraction and being focused on what your partner is saying. Be attentive to how they’re feeling when telling you what is bothering them, and give thoughtful feedback.
If you find yourself at a loss for words, a strong and meaningful hug can always show you're there for your loved one., Sharing your secrets is a small way of telling someone you love that they have your trust. People don't share their secrets with just anyone, so trusting someone with your intimate feelings and thoughts is a true sign of a caring, loving relationship.


Sharing secrets creates an inner circle of just you two, reinforcing a greater bond between you and your partner.

, Being honest with the one you love could sometimes difficult, especially if you are trying to not hurt their feelings. However, speaking the truth, even when it hurts, increases your ability to level and find connection with your partner.It shows that you rather be truthful and real, rather than phony and comforting.


It's a sign of respect to your partner that you are honest with how you feel, while taking into consideration that it might not be the most comfortable option.
Just remember to be gentle with truth. The truth may be hard to hear, but it doesn't have to come off mean.

, As your partner’s partner, it's safe to say that it's your responsibility — as well as in the best interest of the relationship — to show your love, encourage, and help your partner achieve their dreams and goals in life. By providing a supportive environment, you stimulate your partner to be the best version of themselves and go after what they want.


You can encourage your partner by saying things like, ""I believe that you can do this,"" ""You're a hard worker, and that hard work is going to get recognized,"" or ""All of your efforts are going to pay off soon.""
Supporting your partner, and pushing for their success shows your love in words of reinforcement.

, Sometimes writing an old school love letter is a romantic way to show your feelings. Writing a letter can also help articulate feelings and emotions you've been having, by letting your stream of consciousness do the ""talking"". Think about what you want to accomplish with this letter. What do you want your loved one to know? Begin with saying why you’re writing them a letter. For example, you can say something like, “I was thinking about you, and how much I enjoy being around you…” or “Being around you is always so much fun, and I wanted to let you know…”Mention stories and memories that bring back good feelings. Just remember to write what you love about them, how they make you feel, and why you're happy to be with them.
Writing a letter by hand is your best bet to show that what you have to say is meaningful, because it takes more effort that typing up a note or text message. Also, your personal handwriting shows through which gives a nice touch of genuineness.

, Often, not enough credit is given for being able to focus, and really listen to someone when they speak, and then give an attentive, meaningful reply.When you really listen to someone, you are focused on only that person, giving them your full and undivided attention.


Although it’s a simple act, listening is a very powerful act of caring that shows you are there to help your partner through whatever they are dealing with.
Listening to your partner reinforces the idea that you two are a team together, and you are there when your partner needs help.

, Anything you can do to ease the burden of responsibilities weighing down on your loved one will speak volumes as to how much you care for them and love them.


Doing things like running out to get breakfast before they wake up, filling up the gas in their car, or washing their dishes in the sink, are all small ways to show your loved one you are always thinking about them.

, Being considerate means thinking about the feelings of your partner in everything that you do. Decisions you make about certain things should be made with your partner in mind.


For example, if you're going camping, bring extra sleeping mats for your partner, because you know they have a difficult time sleeping on hard surfaces. Or, if you're going on a picnic, pack some extras of your partner's favorite snack as a surprise.

, Everyone has busy lives that we sometimes get wrapped up in, but making an effort to share quality time with your loved one is an easy way to reconnect and show your loved one where your priorities stand. Use this time to share with each other, go on a walk, or make dinner together.


It's really not about the amount of time you share together, but the quality of that time. It doesn't have to have a strict schedule, but the fact that you made the effort at all is what really counts., As adults, life can get monotonous and boring at times. To combat this, keep your inner child alive. Incorporate surprises into your life, be spontaneous and try new things.


This might not seem like a direct display of love, but by keeping things fun in your relationship, it shows that you are working to always have an enjoyable time with your loved one. Go on an adventure together that will create memories and stories for times to come.

, Everyone is different with the level of ""touchy-ness"" that they prefer, but small, affectionate touches can communicate your love in a subtler, physical way. Things like holding hands, playful touches on the arm, or putting your head on their shoulder, are small ways to express your feelings of closeness and love.

, Hugs give people a physical sense of security, and can literally make someone feel like they are wrapped in love. Hugs are easy to execute, and are appropriate to do in public, which makes them ideal for telling your partner you love them out in the world.


Hugs using both arms and facing your loved one are the most romantic. Other kinds of hugs (one armed hugs, side hugs), are more casual and don't hold that much meaning.
A good, meaningful hug usually last a little longer. 5-7 seconds is usually a good amount of time to express your feelings in a hug.

, It's no secret that cuddling with your loved one feels good, and just like hugging, this brief break from the stress of your everyday life will communicate your love by taking time to focus solely on your partner, and what you feel for them.

, Giving your partner a massage could be something as simple as rubbing your partner’s back while you two watch a movie, running your fingers through their hair, or having your partner lay back, and place their head in your lap as your massage their shoulders and neck.


Don’t be afraid to show your love with touch. Touching is just another way people can sense love.

Define the woman of your dreams.,
Be aware that whenever you focus on someone being ""a dream"", you are manufacturing something that may not exist.,
Consider your own contribution to this future relationship.,
Begin looking.,
Remember that luck plays a part in finding this person.,
Be polite to the woman and to her friends.,
Be prepared to get to know one another well.,
Focus on getting to know her most.,
Deal constructively with disagreement.,
Keep things real.",How to Find the Woman of Your Dreams," You might be used to saying ""I want to find the woman of my dreams"" but you need to know what this means for you, such as what her personality is, what she likes/dislikes or even looks like.


Think of key personality traits you consider important in a lifelong partner. Loyalty, generosity, fun-loving, outgoing, focused, and so forth. Which of your own personality traits do you want matched?
Think of the values you'd like this person to hold. Do you want her to have similar values to your own? Or, are you okay with her having quite different ones from you?
Consider your faith or lack of it. Does your ideal woman need to be of the same faith? Also consider family values––what are yours and in what way must hers match those?
What interests would you like this person to have? Does she have to have the same interests as you? Or would you prefer she had completely different interests, or a mixture of both? Is it enough that she's willing to learn about your interests?
Be frank with yourself about appearance. How important a factor is this? Might it be holding you back from finding someone with an amazing personality?
Be a devil's advocate. What sort of things do you not want in your ideal partner? What would you be willing and not willing to compromise about?;
, It is very hard for a person to measure up to an ideal or a creation of perfection in the mind. Having a dream notion of another human being can cause you to be blind to their faults initially, only to leave you extremely disappointed later when these become apparent because the dream is shattered. A realistic approach is to accept that no person is perfect and that it's important to recognize and understand the flawed sides of a person as much as seeing all the things you wish to see.


Realize that any person you date is a mixture of amazing traits and flaws. You are no different either.
You'll never find a woman to date if you expect her to be 100 percent perfect. No such person exists.
Learn to overlook imperfections that don't have a major impact on the relationship. If there are things that will have a major impact, don't be blind to them and realize early on that they could be deal breakers.
Looking for perfection may mean that you are too picky and won't ever find the woman who meets your expectations.
Realize that it takes time to get to know the real person underneath. If you have shallow ideals, you may never really get to know the amazing qualities of the woman unless you're prepared to take the time to get to know her.

, Are you likely to be the ideal man of her dreams? Do you take good care of your health and appearance? Are you interesting? To attract a person, be attractive yourself. Most importantly, you need to understand yourself well, knowing your own identity and values. If you don't know these things, you will have a hard time defining boundaries in your relationship and you may fail to connect well, be afraid of commitment or not notice when you over-rely on the other person to define you.


What are your values and beliefs? Do you have these sorted out for yourself?
Do you know what your life's goals are and what matters to you?
Are you aware of your flaws? What are you doing to address them or manage around them?
Do you have an issue with perfection? If you consider yourself to be perfect, another person will find it hard to meet that, ever. Be willing to compromise and to see your flaws.
Are you truly ready for a long-term relationship yet? You need to know this in order to be serious about your pursuit.

, Where do you find the woman of your dreams? This will depend on the kind of person you're looking for and your own interests. You'll be best off staying open to meeting a woman of your dreams anywhere you might be, so be aware at all times. That said, some of the things you can do to help you find this special person include looking where the possibilities are increased. Some examples include:


Look among your friends. Do they know of people who might be compatible with you? Ask them to keep an eye for someone with whom you might click.
Visit places where you like doing things. If you're sporty and you're looking for a woman who is also sporty, spend time doing that sport and keeping your eyes open. Join a club, take up a sport or become involved in triathlons, etc. if you're not already so involved.
Use online dating resources. There are many options here and you'll easily find matches to your criteria.
Go to social events. Mingle at parties, drinks events, dinner parties and even family events such as weddings and birthdays. You never know who you may bump into and the fun feeling of such occasions can help show people in their happiest light.
Join a hobby or activity class, club or event. For example, if you like dancing, join a dancing class or club.
Your daily commute. Maybe she sits next to you on the train or bus? Strike up a pleasant conversation if you keep seeing the same woman and feel you have a connection.

, You could be walking down the street, doing your grocery shopping or waiting in a queue to pay a bill when you suddenly get a notion that you've found the one. No matter how much you plan and act, sometimes when finding love it's that lucky moment of crossing paths and realizing instantaneously that this is someone you'd like to get to know better.

, You won't win any hearts by being gruff, rude or unpleasant to her or to her friends. Show her respect and treat her friends kindly. They will play a role in judging you and telling her what they think, so be sure it's going to be mostly good things they have to say.

, Don't make an instant judgment as to whether or not this person is the woman of your dreams. It will take time to learn more about her, to get to know her personality and preferences, to find out just how compatible the two of you are. This means being realistic about setting aside the time to do this and not rushing the relationship or your judgment.


Make regular time for each other. Do fun things together to ensure that you enjoy one another's company.
Talk about values, beliefs and things you both care about. These are important aspects for both of you.

, If it's all about you, she'll begin to feel that she's an appendage and not being treated as an individual. Take care not to fill the conversation space with everything you care about rather than allowing her plenty of space to share her thoughts too.


Find out all that you can about what she likes and dislikes. In turn, share your own likes and dislikes too. This can be an area of deal-breaking, so be aware of this at all times.
If you start talking about things that bore her to tears or bother her, tuck this information away for later reflection. Is this a problem for you or is it something you can live with?

, How the two of you cope with not agreeing with one another, having an argument or not seeing eye-to-eye will determine future conflict resolution. This is a valuable part of getting to know one another when determining if this is your dream woman.


Does she handle conflict well? Does she argue fairly to stand by her point without dismissing you?
Do you feel that you can work things out amicably when you don't agree with one another?
Can you see yourself spending a lifetime with this person, able to resolve disagreements in an acceptable way?

, Be real yourself and be genuine in how you interact with this woman. You can't expect to build strong foundations for a lifetime with the woman of your dreams if everything you've represented to her has been a fantasy. It'll all come tumbling down in the most painful way if you try to be something you're not. Instead, be real and let her get to know the person you really are. That way, you'll be absolutely certain that she's the woman of your dreams, because she connects with your true self.

Building up confidence.,
Let your body language speak for itself.,
Write a letter.,
Keep it light.,
Tell your crush your feelings in person.,
Respond appropriately.",How to Express Your Feelings to the One You Love2," Just be yourself when you want to interact with your crush. You don't want to build your relationship off of lies and pretending to be someone you're not, so let your personality shine through. Sometimes, when you stuck about things to talk about, ask your crush about themselves or give them a compliment. You can say something like, ""What sports do you like to play?"" or ""You did really good on your presentation today.""


The easiest subjects to talk about with your crush are things you have in common, like classes, places you've traveled, or favorite restaurants. Talking about things you have in common will lighten the mood and help you relax.

, Touching anybody is a sign of closeness. So, a subtle way to express to your crush that you like them is to break the touch barrier. Light touches are the best way to go to get your message across without coming off too strong.


For example, if you’re talking with your crush or passing by them, you can give them a light touch on the upper arm. If you’re sitting next to your crush, you can casually let your feet or knees touch every once and smile to show your feelings.
Just a little bit physical attention will let your crush know that you like them. Touching you crush lightly just once or twice during a conversation is sufficient enough to let your crush know how you're feeling.

, It can sometimes be hard to verbalize your feelings to someone you like, so writing a love letter is an easy way to express how you feel without having to do it in person. Just like in the previous method, begin your letter by stating your inspiration for writing the letter.


For instance, you can begin with, ""I've really enjoyed getting to know you better over these past couple of months..."" or ""I just wanted to let you know that over this past year, you have become one of my best friends...”
In our day and age of technology, typing out a text message or Facebook message is easy. Writing a letter by hand is more sincere and requires a bit more effort. Because of the added effort, your gesture is that much more appealing to your crush.

, You letter can start off casual, and you can write about a few inside jokes that the two of you have together or fun times that you've experienced together. From there, you can dive right in, and explain the reason for the letter, telling your crush you have feelings for them. You can say something like, ""I just wanted to tell you that I like you, and I really like hanging out with you.""


Keep it short and sweet. You don't want to go too much into how much you like your crush or why, before you have your answer as to how they feel about you.

, Pick a place that's stress-free where it would be appropriate to talk alone, make eye contact, and simply tell your crush how you feel. You can make some small talk, but after a while jump right in and tell them how you feel. You can give a compliment or two while your telling your crush how you feel. For example, ""I really like you. Nobody makes me laugh like you do.""


After you tell your crush how you feel, give them time to react and process what you've said. Don't immediate ask them how they feel or what they think.
You don't want to come off too intense. Give your crush some time to react and respond, and try not to put the pressure on them.

, Once you say how you feel, your crush will either say that they share your feelings, or want to just stay friends. If your crush shares your feelings don't be afraid to your excitement. It's okay to be silly and giddy after you and your crush tell each other how you feel. If your crush just wants to be friends, be mature and say something like, ""Okay, I just wanted to let you know."" It will hurt, but you always want to leave a good impression. Although you will be upset, try to act like it wasn't a big deal, and wait until you have some privacy to be sad about it.


Once you know your crush likes you back, you can ask your crush on a casual date by offering to go see a movie together, or catch a baseball game. This will offer up some time for the both of you to get to know each other better.
If your crush doesn't share your feelings, at least you had the confidence to take a chance. There are plenty of other opportunities to find someone right for you.

Avoid “players.” A player is good at playing the game, yet ultimately he or she can hurt you.,
Meet new people.,
Be open to possibilities.",How to Figure Out the Type of Person You Should Date," Do you want a casual date, a fling, or a long-term relationship? Knowing what you want from the start can help you narrow down potential partners more effectively and steer the relationship in the direction you want. If you’re not sure what you want, be honest with yourself in saying that, and be honest with any potential dates you have.


By knowing what kind of relationship you want, you can better understand the types of people available and what they are looking for as well.;
, Sometimes it’s not about finding a “type”, it’s about finding a good fit. Find someone who is interested in you, asks questions about your life, and with whom you have a mutual curiosity about. If you go to a sports bar and your date’s more focused on the game than on you, this can set the tone for any future time you have together.For example, be with someone who asks questions and seems interested in your answers. If someone only seems interested in talking about himself or herself, reconsider if you want to see this person again.

, If you have strong religious, political, social, or spiritual values, you may want to find someone who shares these values with you. Your goal should never be to change anyone, so if you find that you are unable to cope with various differences, think about them from the onset.Define your values by writing them down. What do you value in your own life, and what values would you like to be shared in your date? How important are these values for you?


For example, if you value exploring different spiritual traditions, you may want a partner who also shares this value, and you may be put-off by someone who is very religious or not interested in spirituality. Then, you can know who to single in on when you’re ready to date.

, Think about how you want a potential date to fit into your current (or ideal) lifestyle. For example, if you like going to fancy restaurants, you may not want to date someone who is stingy or overly concerned with money. Likewise, if you love hiking, camping, and kayaking on the weekends, don’t date someone who despises the outdoors. If you enjoy your time off, you may not be compatible with someone who is a workaholic.Find someone who can appreciate and perhaps even participate in your lifestyle.


For example, if you have a dog, you may want someone who likes dogs. Trying to convert someone to like your dog when he or she doesn’t like dogs to begin with may be a frustrating and heartbreaking endeavor., While some people define socially acceptable age limits for dating, it’s up to you to decide how old or young you feel comfortable dating.If you feel strongly about age differences, you may want to narrow down your potential daters to a certain age range that makes you feel comfortable. To some, age is just a number, while to others, it can make a huge difference in whether or not it’s worth dating.


When considering dating age, make sure you factor in maturity. Some younger dates may, in fact, be more mature than older dates.

, Some people avoid dealing with themselves by escaping through drugs, alcohol, tv, food, video games, etc. Don’t spend your effort avoiding yourself and instead, embrace who you are. Spend time alone without any distractions. Reflect on how you view yourself or what kind of inner dialog you have with yourself. When you find that you're comparing yourself to others, realize that you’re fine just the way you are.If you struggle with comparing yourself to others or not feeling “good enough,” say to yourself, “Where I am at is okay.” You can also say, “My best is different than someone else’s best, and that is okay.”

, Everyone has flaws and weaknesses, so don't allow yours to hold you back. Sometimes things you consider to be a flaw will be things that make you unique or interesting, such as imperfections in your appearance. Other issues that you have with yourself might stem from old wounds in your past that you can work to overcome. Either way, you are worthy of love, so don't hold yourself back from it.

When you find yourself thinking of a flaw or weakness, write a few positive affirmations that remind you that it won't hold you back.
For example, a person who is worried about a scar might write, ""My scar is part of who I am and tells a story about my journey,"" ""My scar is beautiful because it allowed me to survive and keep living,"" and ""My scar is more apparent to me; others won't notice my scar as much because they are more focused on what they like about me.""

, Some people lose themselves when they start to date someone new and are unsure of their own preferences. It’s important to know yourself and your preferences before you include someone new into your life. If you want to share interests with someone else, know your interests first.If you don’t know your likes and interests, start doing some exploration. Ask yourself if there’s something you’ve always wanted to do. Try activities you’ve never tried before, like traveling or painting. Find out what ignites you.
Develop your preferences by trying new things and having different experiences. Explore different cuisines, figure out if you like to take risks, and see how it feels to try something that makes you scared. Do something outside of your comfort zone and see how it feels.

, Hobbies connect you with something you enjoy doing and unleash the potential for expressing creativity.You can also connect with potential dates through engaging in a hobby. Ask yourself whether you want to practice your hobbies on your own or whether you’d prefer to do them with a date.


If you want to start a hobby but don’t know what to do, consider picking up an instrument, engaging in a sport like skiing, starting a collection, or making something by hand.
For more information, check out How to Find a Hobby.

, Don't try so hard to find the right person to date because it will be counterproductive. The right person will be most interested in you if you show the qualities that they are attracted to, so focus on being what you want to attract. When you are at your best, you'll attract someone who is right for you.

Write down the qualities about yourself that you'd like your partner to have, as well.
Go out and have fun without a significant other. This will remind you that you can be happy alone, and it will show others that you are a stable, thriving potential partner.

, Before you start dating, it’s important to have friends of your own. It can be easy to get wrapped up in dating and meeting new people, but make sure you have friends that you can count on as a regular part of your life. Otherwise, you may find yourself only meeting new people on dates and not having other people to spend time with. Friends help balance your relationships and provide emotional support and fun.Having friends means you put less pressure on someone you’re dating to be everything for you.
If you don’t have a social network, call up old friends to reconnect. Connect with people with similar interests as you. For example, if you’re vegan, you may want to have vegan friends or if you enjoy biking you may want friends who bike with you. You can also check out How to Make Friends.

, Abuse can be physical, verbal, emotional, psychological, financial, and sexual, and sometimes people may show early warning signs of being an abuser. If someone blames you for things early on, appears entitled, holds onto resentment, or has a high sense of superiority, these can be red flags for potential abuse.The problem is, most abusers can hide their behaviors and you may only notice abusive tendencies once you’re attached. Watch closely for the following warning signs and take them seriously when they emerge:


They try to rush you into a relationship faster than you are ready for or used to.
They appear ""too good to be true.""
They appear to be your perfect match and/or have no flaws.
They always blame others, including you, for anything negative that happens, and they don't take responsibility for their actions.
They constantly criticize you, put you down, or try to control how you look or what you wear.
They try to limit your access to your family and friends.

, Perhaps you refuse to date someone who eats meat, likes a particular sports team, or is really messy. Know what things you are absolutely sure you cannot and will not budge on and narrow potential dates out with these things.


For example, if you had a bad previous experience on a date or in a relationship, learn from your mistakes and vow never to make the same mistake again. If you dated a moocher before, don’t do it again.
Even when you make non-negotiables, be prepared for them to change. For example, if you feel certain you cannot date someone under or over a certain height, you may actually find someone wonderful who doesn’t quite fit that criteria. Be prepared to change items without feeling bad or guilty. Just don’t compromise your values.

, Look out for warning signs of a player, such as someone who is overly bold, comes on very strong emotionally, orchestrates overly romantic dates, has many acquaintances but few friends, and is a thrill seeker.These can be indications that you’re with a player, not a genuine man or woman. While players make you feel good, the feelings quickly dwindle and may leave you feeling empty much sooner than you anticipate.


Remember that players play the “game” and are quite good at it. Don’t get swept up by a man or woman who plays the game well.

, One of the best ways to know what works for you and what does not is meeting lots of people. Learn from each interaction and expand your knowledge of people and the world.Be willing to go on lots of dates and explore what traits attract you. You’ll likely meet people who interest you and also people who disgust you. Keep in mind that by meeting certain people, you gain a clearer understanding of what kind of person you want to date and what traits you’d like to avoid.


For example, you may realize that you want to date someone with kids, or you want to date someone without kids. It’s important to figure these things out early.

, There’s a difference between knowing what you want and being picky versus being biased, callous, or shallow. It’s not fair to say that “all men are jerks” or “all women are high maintenance.” If you’ve been burned before, let it go and wait until you’re ready to move forward once again.You may feel strongly about not dating certain people, but be ready to critically think about that boundary.


It’s good to know what you want to avoid, but also be willing to look at why those things matter. If you avoid dating people from a certain city, ask yourself if you’re limiting yourself due to a certain bias or bad experience.

Become content with your relationship as it stands.",How to Fall Out of Love with Your Best Friend," Be civil and thoughtful in how you go about this. You don't want to completely reject the healthy relationship that you've established between each other, but you need to take care of your feelings. Don't make active efforts to see them on a daily basis.


There are countless ways to set up safe and respectful boundaries between you and this person.If you do see this person, be open without giving them all of your attention. Protect yourself without isolating them.
Prepare some reasonable excuses why you can't see this person. You might feel like you are deceiving your friend, especially if you have an honest history. Just know that you are doing this only because you need time to get over him or her.Monetary related issues are nearly always understandable, especially if it's in relation to having to work longer hours. If you work longer hours, then you're more tired, and exhaustion should always be a viable excuse.;
, Before creating an extreme distance, you want to make sure that you really are in love with this person. There's an immense amount of pressure riding on this situation, as you're running the risk of permanently damaging a friendship.


When you're in love, the central dopamine levels in your brain will ramp up, giving you an intense attention and focus on the person that you're falling for.Your love object will be occupying a great deal of your daily thoughts, so it may feel like you are obsessing over them.
It's unlikely, if you're really in love with this person, that you're thinking about anyone else. Your thoughts will all be overly positive, as you overlook your love object's negative traits when you've fallen for them.
If you feel any or all of these things, you may actually be in love with your best friend.
You must make sure that you aren't feeling this way because you're lonely and have a strong platonic bond with this person. You run the risk, when considering your love for your best friend, of misinterpreting the caring relationship between you for romantic love.Make sure that you aren't reaching out to this person because you want a romantic relationship, and they seem like a good fit.

, There's nothing worse, after going through a trying emotional circumstance like a rejection, than pushing your feelings away and hiding from them. Even worse is tricking yourself into believing that you aren't allowed to feel those emotions.If you judge your emotions, or tell yourself that you aren't allowed to feel them, then you're hiding from the realness of your pain.
Even though it's immensely difficult to cope with heartbreak, you will become stronger in the process. You will also spend less time wallowing if you accept your emotions and try to focus on the present.

, If you allow this rejection to completely shatter your well-being, you stand no chance of getting over your heartbreak. Even though it requires a little extra effort, you have to make active strides in improving your self-worth.Remember that your rejection does not rest entirely on your character. Your best friend might be coping with some massive issues with their own identity. This person may be afraid to commit themselves to you because of fear and insecurity.
Being alone will help you grow, and even though it feels like an insurmountable pain, you'll be stronger as a result.
Try to see this as an opportunity to improve upon yourself, or take time to work on your own goals. Rejection has the potential to fuel your drive as a human being, as you can use these bad feelings to inform your forward momentum.If you fall back into a self-deprecating spiral, you won't be able to move beyond your pain. Remembering that rejection is inevitable will make this particular rejection seem less significant.

, While it may seem counterproductive, you actually don't want to block this person out of your brain entirely. When you attempt to push all thoughts of this person away from you, you'll no doubt return to thinking of them when you don't want to. This actually makes it much tougher to get over them.


Known as the ""White Bear Effect,"" your active attempts to not think about a white bear will undoubtedly make a white bear pop into your mind.This is the case with all addictions and obsessions.
When your love object enters your mind, you must acknowledge their existence, despite the pain. You don't need to panic, and you certainly don't need to take it as a sign that you'll never get over them.

, When you've been rejected by your love interest, you'll immediately feel a great amount of self-hatred and insecurity. You've put it all on the line, and you will probably feel like you've failed in some way.Becoming confident in yourself again is crucial in overcoming the hardship.


You need to learn how to reconnect with your emotions in the present, rather than thinking about the mistakes of your past. Meditation helps in centering your brain toward the now.
A simple cross-legged meditation is a good place to start. Hold your spine tall and bring your hands to the center of your heart. Keep your palms held together, with the thumbs and the pinkies aligned. Bring your focus to the tip of your nose and breathe.
When you release your fear and anxiety about the past, you'll be able to use the energy you've gained in moving forward with strength.

, It's crucial, in overcoming heartbreak, that you lean on those around you. Remember how necessary these friendships are to your well-being, and how well you've been treated by these individuals in the past.If you have great friends, then you have friends that you can be yourself around.


Depending on how tumultuous your romantic feelings toward your best friend have been, you may have felt distant from your other friendships for quite some time. Because you can't pine over this person anymore, you can focus your energy on healthier relationships in your life.

, In the aftermath of a deep heartbreak, you are wrapped in a large number of varying emotions. These can range from anxiety, anger, and deep sorrow, among others. Keep in mind, however, that while these feelings exist, they are not absolute fact.Coined by Tibetan Buddhist teacher Tsoknyi Rinpoche, the phrase ""real but not true,"" is important to keep in mind when processing these emotions. You can validate that you are feeling a certain way without giving absolute power to the emotions.

, While it may take a bit of extra effort on your part, it's not a bad idea to try dating another person, even if you're still recovering.You should not attempt to replace your broken heart. It's not a bad idea, however, to spend time with someone in a casual romantic setting.


Don't inundate your date with your sad story. They shouldn't have to be burdened with what you're going through.
Even if nothing comes of your date, you can definitely find comfort in your connection with another person.
If anything, setting up a profile on OKCupid or another dating site will provide you with some positive reinforcement from strangers.It's not going to solve your problems, but any positive word from those around you will help you heal.

, While this is a necessary step for any heartbreak, it's especially important when your love object holds a dear place in your heart as a longtime friend.Any malice sent toward this person will only exacerbate your problems.


It may seem unproductive, especially when this person has very recently broken your heart, but extending love toward this person will actually help you get over them. It can add to your peace of mind and stability, and you'll eliminate a lot of potential cynicism.
This does not mean that you should extend this love to this person in a tangible way. Don't give them attention through the internet or send a text. You can, however, wish them positive feelings when by yourself.

, While it's the worst case scenario in this sort of situation, there's a possibility that the confusion of the situation might have driven you two apart forever.More than likely, you will be the person who can't move beyond the weight of the situation, as your feelings have proven to be unrequited.


If you've taken the proper time to be alone and get yourself back on track, then you can decide whether or not you feel ready to be friends again.
Don't be hard on yourself if you're having trouble moving on. It may require far more time than you initially anticipated.
With more time apart, new feelings for others may enter your brain. This may or may not help you get over your former love object.

, It's a lot easier to manage your friendship if you're not spending a lot of one-on-one time with your best friend. It's still important to maintain boundaries with this person, even if it's difficult.Your impulse might be to continue doing all the same activities that you did when you were best friends. For the time being, you'll want to avoid anything too intimate or private.


Figure out what sort of relationship you might have with this person. You may not be able to spend time alone watching television, but perhaps you can still chat over a beer or cup of coffee.

, Remember, if your friend is happy, you should be too. This is where being mature comes in. You love your friend, and you want him or her to be happy, whatever the decision may be.


Be sure that you're actively pushing through the awkwardness. Figure out your new boundaries as friends.
You'll both have to change your expectations and assess what you're allowed to do, so this should start with acceptance of your present situation.

If someone shares your interests, you will be more likely to be compatible. To find someone who is compatible with you, do things that you enjoy and consider making a profile on an online dating site.


For example, if you are passionate about animals, volunteer your time at a local animal shelter. If you love running, join a local running club. Find something that allows you to do what you love and interact with people who share your passion.
You can also try meeting someone through an online dating site. These sites can help you to determine if the person shares your interests before you meet them, which may make it easier for you to connect with the person.;
, To indicate your interest in someone, you will need to demonstrate your interest through your facial expressions, body language, and comments. Using things like body language, eye contact, and flirtatious comments can help to show the other person that you are interested in them. If you are a novice at flirting, keep it simple to start. Some simple ways that you can flirt include:



Smiling. Smiling is an easy way to flirt and it can also make you seem more attractive.Making Eye Contact. Keep good eye contact is another simple way to indicate your interest to your date. Research has shown that prolonged eye contact can increase feelings of attraction between two people.Mirroring Body Position. Stand or sit in a way that mirrors your date. For example, if your date is leaning in towards you with one arm on the table, you could do the same., Research has shown that putting yourself into a thrilling situation can increase feelings of attraction between two people.Make sure that you plan some exciting dates when you are first getting to know someone to increase feelings of attraction. Go to see an action movie together, spend a day at an amusement park, or go bungee jumping.

, When you are first getting to know someone, it is important to avoid sharing too much about yourself too soon. Some people share too much of themselves in the early stages of a relationship because they want to seem honest and forthright. But sharing too much too soon can be overwhelming for the other person and also makes you less mysterious.For example, you should avoid discussing topics like your ex, family conflicts, or your personal finances.

, It is important to find out if you are compatible with the other person in order to fall in love, so ask questions to get that information. The questions that you ask should not be invasive or too personal. They should be friendly and fund to discuss. For example, some questions you might ask on a first date include:Are you passionate about anything? If so, what?
Do you have any favorite movies or TV shows?
Are you more of a morning person or a night person?
What sort of vacations do you like to take?

, Before you make the decision to go out looking for love, take some time to consider whether or not you are really ready. There are many reasons why you may not be ready to fall in love, but some of the most common ones include:


Recently got out of a relationship. If you have recently gotten out of a relationship and you are still working through feelings of loss, then looking for love might not be a good idea just yet. If you are not fully over your old relationship, then you may have a hard time entering into a new one. Give yourself more time if you need it.
Not sure who you are or what you want. Knowing who you are and what you want out of life is essential to a healthy log-term relationship. If you are still not sure what you want your life to look like 5, 10, or 20 years from now, then you may want to take some time to figure that out. Spend some time getting to know yourself before you go looking for love.You are dealing with depression or another serious mental health condition. If you are looking at falling in love as a way to overcome feelings of loneliness and depression, you may want to reconsider. When falling in love does not work out, it can cause feelings of emotional stress and depression.Therefore, you may not be able to handle a potential letdown if you are already depressed. If you think you are depressed or dealing with some other type of mental health problem, talk to a therapist and get yourself well.

, Physical attraction is not everything, but it is important that you look and feel your best in order to attract someone. Make sure that you are taking care of your basic needs, such as diet, exercise, sleep, and grooming, before you go looking for love.Visit a salon or barber shop for a haircut if you haven’t had one in a while.
Buy yourself some new clothes if yours are worn or outdated.
Work on getting healthy by improving your diet and exercising more.
Make sure that you are giving yourself enough time to rest and relax each day.

, It is common for people to become so wrapped up in a new relationship that they stop doing things that matter to them. But not making enough time for you and your interests can be bad for you and bad for your new relationship. Remember to make enough time for you and your interests no matter how much you want to skip them to extra spend time with your new love interest., It is important to make your intentions known to the other person if you want to continue seeing the person. If you are enjoying spending time with the person, let them know. You don’t need to declare long-term intentions in the early stages of a relationship, but you need to say that you enjoy spending time with the person and that you’d like to keep seeing them.Try saying, “I’ve had a great time on our last few dates and I’d like to keep seeing you if that is something you are interested in.”

, If you are not enjoying your time with someone or you just don’t think you are a good fit, don’t prolong the inevitable. Tell the person how you feel and move on. Breaking up with someone is not easy, but it is better than continuing a relationship that you are not enjoying.


Make sure that you do not make the mistake of breaking up via text, email, or social media. It might seem easier for you, but it will be more upsetting for the person on the other end.If you need to break up with someone, try arranging to meet with the person at a neutral spot like a park or a café. Try saying something like, “I’m sorry but I just don’t think it is working between us, so I don’t think we should go out anymore.” Be compassionate if the person responds with tears or frustration, but don’t change your mind out of pity.Don’t waste your time on someone who does not feel the same way about you as you do about them. If the other person indicates that they are not interested in continuing to see you, don’t try to chase them or change their mind. It is important to find someone who will return your feelings and treat you how you deserve to be treated.

, At some point after you have been dating someone for a while, you will need to decide to make a commitment to each other. This commitment may come in the form of a label such as boyfriend or girlfriend or you may be so in love that getting engaged is the next step. Whatever the next step is for you, it is important to talk about it and make sure that you are both on the same page.


Try saying something along the lines of, “I don’t want to pressure you, but I like being with you. I would like to continue our relationship and I know that someday I want to be married/have kids/etc. What do you think?”, In order to ensure a lasting love, you need to be trustworthy and be able to trust your partner in return. Building trust require you and your partner to be vulnerable with each other, be understanding, keep promises, and keep the lines of communication open. Each time that you trust your partner to take care of something for your or to keep his or her word, you are providing a chance for your partner to follow through and earn more trust from you.For example, if your partner is responsible for paying the electric bill each month, don’t constantly remind him or her to do so. Trust that the bill will get paid. If it does, then you will have a deeper bond between you.

, Spending too much time together can cause problems in a relationship. If you spend every waking moment with your partner, then you may not appreciate the time that you have together as much. Make sure to plan activities apart and retain your independence as you continue your relationship.Try setting aside a night or day each week where you both do something on your own or with friends.

, Although it is important to have some time apart from your partner now and then, time together is also very important. Make sure that you set aside time each day to catch up, perhaps over your morning coffee, over dinner, or during an evening walk.You should also make time to do things together like you did in the early days of your courtship. For example, you can plan a movie night, a hiking trip, or a visit to a local museum.

, To maintain the spark in a relationship, find ways to surprise each other. You can do something as simple as bringing home some flowers or preparing a special dinner for your partner. Or, you can do something more elaborate like arranging a surprise birthday party or planning a dream vacation for the two of you. Look for ways to surprise your partner that will help him/her to feel special., Love may fade in a relationship if one or both partners do not feel appreciated. Make sure that you tell your partner what you appreciate about him or her on a regular basis. Be specific and make sure that the things you mention are about your partner, not about you. If you appreciate your partner on a regular basis, it is more likely that you will also be appreciated in return.For example, you might tell your partner that you appreciate what a good listener he is or that you appreciate the way that she always has something positive to say when you get home from work.

, Having shared traditions is a great way to strengthen a bond between two people or among families.You and your partner can create some traditions that will strengthen your bond as your relationship continues to develop.


For example, you might start a tradition of revisiting the restaurant you went to on your first date on the anniversary of your first date each year. Or you might start a special holiday tradition, such as having a horror movie marathon on Halloween while you hand out candy to trick-or-treaters.

, As your relationship progresses, you can build a deeper bond by sharing things with your partner that you haven’t yet told them. Tell your partner about your fears, hopes, and dreams for the future and ask about theirs.Be considerate of the things your partner shares with you, even if they seem unlikely or do not appeal to you.

, In every relationship, conflicts will arise and you will need to find ways to work through them so that you both feel satisfied. One of the best things you can do to deal with conflicts is to know when you are at fault (or at least a little at fault) and own up to it. Taking responsibility for your role in the conflicts that arise in your relationship will help to make conflicts easier to resolve.For example, if you and your partner often argue about money, be the first to say how you have contributed to your financial problems and invite your partner to identify some ways he or she has contributed as well. Identifying your shared shortcomings provides an opportunity for you and your partner to come up with ways to resolve the issues that you are both having regarding money, rather than blaming each other for causing the problem.

Try not to idealize your partner.,
Be yourself.",How to Fall in Love Again," The parts of your brain that deal with falling in love are the same parts that handle physical pain and even addiction.Falling in love can feel wonderful, but it can also cause serious emotional and even physical distress when you experience the loss of that love. Time can help you recover, but it’s not a process you can rush.;
, It can be hard to believe that you deserve to be loved, especially if you have experienced relationships that focused on criticizing your imperfections rather than accepting you as a person. However, everyone is worthy of being loved, and you can help develop that sense of worthiness by practicing loving yourself. Learning to practice self-compassion can help you increase your feelings of self-worth.Self-compassion involves three basic elements: self-kindness (accepting yourself as a flawed but worthwhile human being), common humanity (understanding that all humans make mistakes), and mindfulness (recognizing and accepting experiences without judging them).
If you catch yourself making generalizing statements such as “I’ll never find someone who loves me” or “Nobody wants me,” try to find evidence that challenges these statements, such as “I haven’t found a romantic relationship yet, but I do have friends who like to be around me” or “My value does not depend on whether others want me. I am worthy of love because I am human.” Psychologists have demonstrated that challenging these self-negating beliefs can actually change how you feel about yourself., Practicing mindfulness is a core element of self-compassion, and it can also help you during times of stress or anxiety. One of the most damaging things about experiencing the loss of a relationship is playing the “what if” game with yourself: “What if I’d said something different?” “What if I’d been taller/shorter/funnier?” Dwelling on all of the possible ways things could have turned out differently will prevent you from being able to move on and find new happiness. Meditation, which focuses on being present in the moment, can help you get over obsessing about the past., It’s very important to understand your core identity -- your hopes, your goals, your values -- before committing to a relationship with someone else. Knowing who you are, what you want, and what you value will help you determine what things you can compromise on and what are genuine deal-breakers. Understanding yourself will also help you avoid looking for a relationship to “fulfill” things for you that you can only fulfill yourself.Many things about a person can and do change, but we usually all have some core values that tend to remain constant throughout our lives, such as ambition, honesty, consistency, flexibility, or vulnerability. These beliefs guide our behavior, choices, and actions. Understanding what these are for you will help you find someone who shares them.Other important things about yourself to consider could be whether or not you feel the desire to have children, how you approach earning and managing money, your decision-making processes, and your need to find a partner who shares your religious beliefs., Many people want the same basic things out of a romantic relationship: love, support, companionship.However, how these desires manifest themselves vary between people. Take some time to explore your emotional needs and priorities and how your ideal partner could fulfill those. Figure out what is essential, and what you could comfortably compromise on.


Keep your expectations realistic. It’s quite appropriate and healthy to desire a partner who respects and supports you; without those behaviors, you can’t have a healthy relationship. However, it’s not healthy to need a partner to make you feel “whole” or “worthwhile.” Those are needs you can only meet for yourself.
It’s common to have a list of “must-haves” for a partner, but therapists say that the most important “must-have” in a romantic relationship is someone who shares your core values. For example, if you value emotional openness and the other person doesn’t, it will be very difficult for you to maintain a fulfilling relationship., In order to help you understand what type of person will make you happy in a romantic relationship, consider the other relationships you have, such as those with friends and family, that you feel satisfied by. What feelings do you experience in those relationships, and why? How do those people relate to you and express their feelings for you?Also consider the types of friends you tend to have. While most of us have friends with very different personalities, in many cases they will still possess core traits that allow us to form fulfilling relationships with them. For example, if you notice that most of your close friends are extroverts, you may want to look for a partner who is extroverted. If you tend to have very openly affectionate friends, a partner who is less emotionally demonstrative might not satisfy your needs.

, While it’s tempting to try to never think of an ex again after a break-up, research has demonstrated that people who reflect on their recent break-ups actually recover more quickly and easily than those who don’t engage in this reflection.Expressing your feelings, whether to a therapist, a friend or to yourself in a journal, can help you recover from the emotional damage of a break-up and reinforce your positive sense of self.


Reflection can also help you pinpoint any unhealthy or unproductive behaviors that occurred in your last relationship; often, those same behaviors will come back to haunt your new relationship unless you take action to change yourself and how you search for romance.

, This term was coined by psychologist Robert Firestone to describe a phenomenon that happens all too often in new relationships: Because of defensive behaviors established due to past hurts, the individuals within a couple abandon their individual identities and interests to merge into a single unit, in the hopes that it will completely fulfill and protect them.This causes issues because it doesn’t allow either partner to live as a unique individual within a healthy couple relationship. It fosters dependency, possessiveness, and putting the other person into a set “role” rather than accepting the challenges that come with real adult relationships.Signs of a “fantasy bond”-based relationship include:

Difficulty in expressing interests or ideas other than those you share with your partner
Relying on everyday routines for intimacy rather than emotional closeness
Overusing “we” statements, speaking for the other person
Defining yourself as a “role” (wife, mother, breadwinner, father) rather than developing personal goals and interests
Discomfort in pursuing any activities or interests on your own, without your partner (or discomfort if your partner does these things)



, Particularly if you’ve been hurt in love before, it may be hard for you to feel comfortable opening up about your real interests and feelings. However, if you want to develop a healthy, happy romantic relationship, meaningful communication is essential.Talk about your ideas, goals, and interests. The ability to share what’s most important to you with another person is one of the highlights of romantic relationships.
Avoid mind-reading. Especially if you feel like you know someone well, it can be tempting to “read between the lines” when they say something, particularly if that something has upset you. For example, if your significant other forgot an important date for you, a mind-reading response would be: “You forgot this because you don’t really care what’s important to me.” If you find yourself or your significant other saying things like “If you really loved me you would….” take a step back.Ask the other person what happened; don’t make assumptions.

, Research psychologist Dr. Arthur Aron has famously developed a list of 36 questions that foster interpersonal intimacy, such as “If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why?”These work because good questions do more than ask about surface-level interests; they invite discussion about the other person’s hopes, dreams, goals, and values., When you’re experiencing the first heady rush of falling in love, it can be easy to idealize the other person as “the one,” the only person who knows you, fulfills you, or could possibly understand you. The problem with this is that nobody can live up to that ideal, and when you finally come to that realization, you may end up overreacting to discovering your partner’s flaws.While you don’t want to dwell on or overly criticize your partner’s flaws, acknowledging them is healthy. All humans have flaws and make mistakes; being honest about this will help you accept the other person for who they are, rather than an idea of what you want them to be.

, If your significant other really loves you, s/he will accept you for who you are, flaws and all. S/he should also accept that you have interests of your own that give meaning to your life, and should not attempt to keep you from enjoying healthy pursuits. Being yourself in a romantic relationship not only gives you the freedom to be happy and fulfilled, it allows the other person to express themselves and experience that freedom too.Particularly if you’ve experienced abusive or traumatic relationships in the past, it can be easy to feel as though you need to change yourself to make yourself “lovable” to the other person. However, while we all make small changes (keeping the house neater, showing up on time, etc.) to accommodate the other person’s needs, you should not feel as though you need to “settle” for someone who mistreats you or makes you feel as though you need to change something fundamental about yourself to make them happy.If you feel afraid to express your true feelings, or if you worry about acting as you normally would around your partner, you may not be in a relationship that’s healthy for you.

Cuddle with them.,
Give them a simple gift.",How to Express Your Love With That Special Someone," By saying these words, you are giving them access to your heart. Don't go saying it if you don't mean it. ONLY say it if you mean it or it WILL hurt their feelings.;
, Break the touch barrier and hug them straight out and cuddle with them. If they really love you, they will hug back. Just don't force them to do what they don't want to do. ;)

, By doing this, you will tell them that you are interested but not quite ready for the big boy/girl stuff yet. Don't start making out with him or her until you've really got down the pecking part but if he or she does first, don't back away which is telling them that you aren't interested. Slowly kiss back.

, You may do so by slowly moving towards them. Wrap your arms around him or her. Slowly open your mouth and explore his or her mouth. Don't worry if the kiss isn't 100% perfect. None are...it depends if you concentrate hard enough.

Think of her specific, unique qualities that you love.,
Choose a quiet, safe, and generally happy time to talk.,
Keep it simple and honest.,
Just put the words out there.,
Once you're done talking, sit back and listen, no matter what the response.,
If you can't see each other in person, expressing your feelings through a phone call or letter.",How to Express Love to a Girl1," Telling someone you love her doesn't happen every day, and very few people will ever become such an important object of your affection. To genuinely express your love from the heart, think about the things that make this woman special. They can be little memories you share, a quirk she has you can't get enough of, or skills and a personality that still amazes you.


You may bring these things up when you talk, you may not. What is important is that you understand why you feel in love. It is much easier to express something, after all, if you understand it.;
, You simply want somewhere you can comfortably express your feelings and listen to her response. After a date, on a walk, or simply a quiet moment alone are all good places to talk, but don't stress too much over the location. The words, not the place, are far more important and exciting. That said, there are some not-so-great times to say ""I love you"" the first time:After sex
While drunk or intoxicated
Online or over the phone (unless you cannot see each other in person)
During or after a fight or argument

, While movies may tell you you have to be special or original with your message, you don't. Spending all your time planning or waiting for a perfect moment grossly misses the point of your relationship. You are in love — so just keep it simple and let her know. It will be more than enough, guaranteed.


This isn't to say there is no time for romance and spectacle in your relationship. But expressing your love for someone is a big emotional development — you don't need bells and whistles.
How happy she makes you, good memories you've shared, your hopes and feelings — this is more than enough ""material"" to work with without feeling like you must write a poem or plan an event., Take a deep breath and count to three. When you finish, tell yourself you're just going to blurt out ""I love you."" This is all it takes — three seconds of courage for a potential lifetime of happiness. Don't get caught up in an intro, perfect wording, or anything fancy. Just tell her, ""I love you.""


""I'm in love with you.""
""These last months have been some of the best in my life, and I've been so lucky to meet you. I love you.""
""I've had something on my chest for a while, and it feels good to let it out. I love you.""
Pull her in close for a hug or kiss and, before breaking the embrace, whisper, ""I love you.""

, Think of it this way — you are telling someone you feel one of the most powerful emotions you've ever felt, and you've been dealing with this feeling for a few days or weeks. She is hearing this for the first time, and she may need some time to process her feelings. You can't control how she is going to respond, nor should you try. Instead, listen to her response and let her lead the conversation.It takes an immense amount of courage to tell someone you love them. Be proud of yourself.

, Don't feel like you must wait to be reunited with someone to express your love — if you feel it, let it out. That said, it's hard to understand from a short letter or text message what a quick ""I love you"" means (is it a joke, serious, semi-serious?!) so don't leave any doubt. Take the time to express your feelings in a way that leaves no doubt in your beloved's mind.


Let her know that you'd rather talk to her in person, but couldn't keep your feelings secret any longer.
Elaborate on why you've suddenly started feeling this way, and can't keep it in any more. Give her the feeling and backstory.
Say that you don't need a response or answer immediately, just that you needed to get this off your chest."

Understand your partner’s needs.,

Show affection.,
Spend some alone time together.,
Express gratitude.,
Be kind.,
Share joy.,
Give five times more positive interactions than negative interactions.,
Communicate understanding and empathy despite conflict.,
Express forgiveness.,
Express love regularly.",How to Express Love," You may express love through gifts when your partner receives love through touch. Recognizing that the way you give love may not be the way that your partner receives love can be eye-opening. Yet, knowing the ways your partner feels loved helps you express love in ways that your partner can appreciate. Try different methods, and see what generates the most positive response. Some research has examined five “love languages,” or ways to relate to your partner, express love, and receive love:Words of affirmation: compliments, stating your positive feelings, saying “I love you.”
Quality time: giving your undivided attention to your partner.
Gifts: physical symbols of love such as flowers, jewelry, tools.
Acts of service: walking the dog, cleaning the kitchen.
Physical touch: having sex, holding hands, giving affection.;
, Tell your partner that you love her. Tell your partner when you find her attractive. Your partner cannot read your mind, so express yourself in words when you find yourself admiring your partner. Express the value you see in your partner and remember, it never gets old!You may feel more comfortable writing out your feelings than saying them out loud, so write cards or letters to your partner.
Leave notes for your partner to show you think about her and care for her.

, Affection communicates love in a way that words cannot. When with your partner, be affectionate and express your love through touch. Touch his hair, hold his hand, and put your arm around him. Physical touch can create intimacy and show your partner that you want to be physically close with him.Recognize that some people prefer more affection than others. Talk with your partner about what he appreciates, how he likes to be touched, and whether touch is appropriate in public.

, Life can get busy with work, kids, pets, in-laws, friends, etc. Make sure you set aside some time to spend alone with your partner. Find a sitter for the kids, and clear a night to spend together. Focus on your partner and discuss things that are meaningful to both of you; avoid talking about “To-do’s”, kids, or money. Make a date night and enjoy doing something together.You don’t always have to make date nights romantic; have fun! Do something goofy or choose an activity that you can laugh at and enjoy together.

, Show your partner you care by acknowledging the things that she does that you appreciate. Express gratitude for the things your partner does (such as picking up the kids, buying the dog food) and express gratitude for the qualities you admire that your partner possesses (such as loving, caring, generous).Express your gratitude through words or through a note.
You can give gifts that express gratitude, such as flowers or a beautiful meal or something special that you choose.

, Kindness is the best predictor of stability and long-term satisfaction in relationships. Being kind shows your partner that you are invested in showing love in the relationship. Those who see kindness as a muscle that must be exercised tend to experience more positive interactions than those who see kindness as a fixed trait.If your partner expresses a need and you are tired, distracted, or overwhelmed, don’t neglect your partner. Turn toward your partner and connect.
Kindness is important during fights, too. Treat your partner with kindness, and recognize when you have not been kind to your partner and repair the damage.

, Celebrate your partner’s good news. Be there for your partner when things are difficult, but especially be there when your partner experiences positive news. Partners who celebrate good news together have better long-term stability.Show that you support your partner and share in his joy. Give your partner your full attention when he shares news.


Engage wholeheartedly with your partner. Ask questions and show your enthusiasm.

, Research shows that for every negative interaction, five positive interactions must occur to repair the damage and restore the relationship. If negative interactions are not counter-acted, they can accumulate and cause couples to grow apart.Show that you are listening and understanding your partner.
Reach out with affection.
Use a common connector, like humor.

, Even if you and your partner are disagreeing, show that you are listening. Show empathy for your partner’s point of view by affirming what is said and affirming the feelings your partner is communicating. Remind yourself (and your partner) that you admire him despite there being conflict., It’s okay to admit that you don’t always act kind or understanding in your relationship. Recognize when you’ve let your partner down or made a mistake. Express the mistake to your partner, and ask for forgiveness. Likewise, be quick to forgive your partner when she messes up. Forgiveness allows couples to acknowledge their shortcomings and approach the relationship through growth. Don’t linger on things that have been hurtful; move on., For important relationships, especially with your spouse or other family members, be sure to demonstrate your love often, continually expressing your caring for them in a myriad of ways, especially in the language that they understand best. It is widely believed that ""it's the thought that counts,"" but the thought counts only when the gift of love is actually given. Concealed love benefits no one.

Say ""I love you"" when you feel in love, not because you think you ""must"" say it.,
Use other words to express your love without always saying ""I love you."",
Let her know how much you appreciate her help and support.,
Offer your forgiveness and withhold your blame.,
Be open and honest during arguments instead of hiding or sheltering concerns.,
Make her a part of your plans and future.",How to Express Love to a Girl2," Some people can comfortably say ""I love you"" multiple times a day. Others are more reserved, feeling like over-saying it might lessen its power and beauty. Wherever you fall, there is a good way to make sure your expressions of love only come when you really mean them.If expressing your love feels like a burden on you, then you need to re-examine how you actually feel about her. Are your issues with the word ""love"" or the emotion of love?

, You don't have to be a broken record to express your love regularly. Telling her that you're grateful for her presence, that you're excited just being around her, that you adore her, or any other synonyms for love will get the point across without making your words seem rote or unthoughtful. Try:


""I am better because of you.""
""I cannot stop thinking about you.""
""You drive me crazy on a daily basis, and I love it.""
Use cutesy terms she likes, like darling, honey, doll, etc., Acknowledge the little things she does for you and let her know how cool it is. Tell her that her spaghetti sauce is especially good on the days that it is, and remind her how important her support has been when you're going through tough times. A great way to express your love is to show that you're paying attention and appreciative, making her a big part of your thoughts. Good times include:


After taking care of you or chipping in during a tough time.
When you've felt stressed and are worried you've taken it out on her.
Occasionally remembering regular chores or help. If she packs your lunch every morning before work for you, be sure to thank her for it.

, A loving couple is a team, getting through life's challenges together, not alone. When you hold a mistake over someone's head after she has apologized, however, or you keep a grudge going because you fault her for hard times, you're breaking up the bond. Love is easily expressed in forgiveness, as it shows that your bond is deeper than one issue or mistake. Blaming someone for a problem turns things into a me vs. you scenario.Forgiveness can take time, and that is okay. The point is that you express your love through your willingness to look past honest mistakes, loving the person in her entirety, flaws and all.

, Even loving couples fight, and that is okay. What is more important is how you fight. There will always be issues and differences, but loving couples know that getting things out in the open is more important than burying feelings for a later day. In it's own way, this is an expression of love to a girl — the trust that you can be honest her, and that you can trust her to do the same.


There is no such thing as doing something to ""prove your love."" Love isn't a loan or scientific idea — it doesn't need to be proven., People that you love are naturally part of your future. When you close your eyes, she is there by your side, and letting her know this is a great way to express your love without saying the words. This doesn't mean you map out every detail from marriage to kids — it just means you let her know you're excited to keep her in your life.


""If we could retire together right now, where would you want to go with me?""
Talk about your career and living plans, dreaming, scheming, and planning together even if nothing comes of it.

Find time once a day to tell or show her your love.,
Show physical affection, and talk about each other's needs.,
Do little favors for her, especially unexpected ones.,
Use date nights and little occasions to celebrate your love.,
Give her space and free time to be herself.",How to Express Love to a Girl3," If you make an effort to show your love once a day, whether with a good-night ""I love you"" or by simply putting his toothpaste on her brush for her, you'll keep the relationship strong for a long time. If you're worried about showing your affection, just think about finding one time a day where you can. Even an extra-long, passionate kiss is a great way to slow down time with her for a half-second. , Some people don't mind cuddling up any chance they get. Others prefer to save intimate moments for intimate times. Communication effectively is best way to show affection and express your love in a way everyone is comfortable with. That said, you should feel comfortable expressing your love in public in some capacity:


Hugging and/or kissing goodbye
Holding hands
Light joshing around, flirty pushing and shoving
Telling her you love her around your friends or strangers., Complete one of her chores for her or scramble eggs for breakfast in bed on Sunday. When you show her that you're thinking of her when it's not a special occasion, she'll know that you love her without having to hear it.


This is especially important when she is stressed out. What can you take off her plate to make her life a little easier?
Don't do these favors to get anything in return — just do them to make her a little happier and show your love.

, Take time and effort to splash some color into your life. This doesn't mean blowing your whole paycheck on her; it means setting aside time each week or day for couple time. When you set aside your schedule to be with her and spend some blissful hours together, the message is clear — you love her, and you're willing to express it.


A date night can be take-out and a movie or a fancy restaurant. Maybe you'd rather go camping, in the backyard or a national park. Perhaps you just want to go to a museum and wander for a few hours. The time and thought is the important part.
Though you can't do it every time, surprises are a great way to express your love on a special day.

Remember important dates and events — attention to your relationship on these days makes a big impact. Unfortunately, so does forgetting them., Trusting and allowing her to have fun on her own is key to a strong, healthy relationship. Just because you love her doesn't mean you need to become her shadow. If you really love her, you can happily set her free, counting down the minutes until she comes back.When you are apart, it's okay to want to talk or text. Just don't ""hover"" over her every action or moment. Let her have fun and you'll have good stories to share when you're reunited.
When you know you're in love, you don't have to be jealous. She'll come back.

When in doubt, ask.",How to Determine if the One You Love Loves You," How does the other person respond? They might:


Look back longingly into your eyes, refusing to let go of your eyes. Definitely a good sign. He/She loves you hopelessly.
Avert eyes quickly, blushing or suddenly sweating. This is another good sign. He/She is at least interested in you, but doesn't want you to know.
Look at you quickly, seemingly uninterested, and then look at you as if you are someone's little sister/brother. A bad sign. He/She probably doesn't think of you in the way you think of her/him.
Not look at you at all. This is a tough sign to read. It could mean she doesn't notice you; it could mean he or she's good at keeping things under wraps.;
, Humans talk a lot, but often our body language says a lot more about us than our words do. We smile and laugh for people we like; we scowl and stay silent for people we don't. Try making a joke. It doesn't have to be a very good joke, even. How does the person respond? Do they:


Laugh at a bad joke because they can't help smiling around you? That's a good sign. You can do no wrong in his/her eyes.
Politely force out a laugh but look uncomfortable? This is a tough one to read. They may be uncomfortable because they like you, or they may be uncomfortable because they're decent and they don't want you to feel bad.
Not laugh at all and look at you coldly. That's a bad sign. She or he isn't interested in you enough to try at a social gathering.

, A lot like joking around, smiling at someone will usually produce a response. If the person likes you, they are certain to smile back. If the person doesn't like you, they're more likely to not smile back. Consider these things when ""reading into"" a smile:


A person could simply be caught off guard by your smile. They would love to smile back at you, but yours was so unexpected that they didn't know how to react.
A person may choose not to smile even if they like you. Pretty much, they are convinced that you don't like them, and so they don't want to show you their feelings because they don't want to deal with the rejection.

, See if she/he fidgets around, which a sign of nervousness. Other signs of nervousness could include:



Guys:

Stammering his words, saying ""uhh"" repeatedly.
Visibly sweating or perspiring from the face, neck, or armpits.
Showing off in front of his friends.



Girls:

Playing with her hair: twirling, braiding, etc.
Blushing.
Giggling.
Not saying very much but still staying in the conversation.



, You can test the person you love in various ways, but perhaps the most effective test is the jealousy test. Mention another guy or girl in a casual way. (""Stacy looked really good today. Her hair is a lot better curly than it is straight."") If the person you love stiffens up, goes white, disagrees, or badmouths the person you talked about, it most likely means they are jealous.

, If this person stays close to you throughout the night, and talks with you a lot, this is probably a sign they're interested.

, Sit down the person during lunch. Call the person out of the blue. Track them down between classes. Catch them when they don't expect you to be there and see how they react.


Do they seem happy to see you, flustered, awkward, disheveled, or tense? These are all good signs. There's a spark, it seems.
Do they seem uninterested, condescending, not bothered, or too busy to acknowledge you? There are all bad signs. S/he may be having a bad day, but chances are s/he doesn't like you.

, Ask him/her to slow dance with you; if they say ""yes,"" that's a good sign. If, the rest of the time you're dancing, s/he looks away from you, talks to another person, or can't wait to dance with someone else, then they probably aren't interested.

, Look inside yourself. Often, the answer to the question ""does s/he love me?"" lies inside of you. Ask yourself how you feel after talking with the person. Do you:


Feel exhilarated, good about yourself, and powerful after talking to your love? All that good will probably means there's something between you. Try to explore it!
Feel embarrassed, lifeless, or sad after talking to your love? Although it could just be a case of the blues (are you normally so hard on yourself?) there's a good chance s/he doesn't like you in the way that you had hoped. The good news is there are plenty of fish in the sea.

, If all else fails, and you need to know the other person's feelings, you may have to come right out and ask. Be prepared for the worst but expect the best. Remember, too, that the only way to know if someone loves you is if they accept you for who you are. Nothing more and nothing less. No one is perfect but true love accepts imperfections with perfections.


Go up to the person and say: ""Sorry if this is a little out of the blue. I can't help wondering if there's something, some spark, between us. Because I like you. And if you like me back, I think we should take a shot at it.""

Or maybe go for something a little less bold: ""Hey, this is kind of random, but do you think there's something between us? I think I like you. Actually, I don't think, I know.""

Or try something a little more coy and ask them out on a date. Remember that you don't have to call it a date if you don't want; the other person probably understands that it's a date: ""Hey, so my friend flaked on me for a movie this weekend and I have an extra ticket. Would you want to go with me?""

Find a ripe piece of soft fruit, such as a plum, apricot, or mango.,
Bite a small, mouth-sized hole in the fruit.

Use this as the mouth that you'll practice kissing with.

Use your tongue by gently pushing it into the flesh of the fruit.",How to Practice Kissing2," These fruits are soft and taste good.

Find someone you wouldn't mind kissing.,
Ask someone casually or just go for it.,
Make sure your lips are locked and loaded.,
Make sure your breath smells good.,
Move closer to your partner.,
Make and maintain eye contact until you kiss.,
Kiss at a slight angle.,
Make the first kiss last.,
Start kissing your partner's upper and lower lip.,
Save the french kiss for later.",How to Practice Kissing3," If you want your first kiss to be special, then try picking the person you think would make it the most special. If you're worried that your kissing technique isn't all that great yet, then maybe choose someone you'd be less embarrassed about. (And stop worrying! Kissing is fun once you get the hang of it.)


There's nothing like kissing a real, breathing human being. A person will respond to your lips like a hand or a fruit can't.
Kissing comes naturally to humans. That's why we do it! Practicing kissing before you actually kiss is like practicing riding a bike on a seesaw. It doesn't really prepare you for the real deal. You get good at riding a bike by riding a bike, just like you get good at kissing by kissing another person.

, If you're a girl, you might just be able to go up to a guy and ask him if he wants to kiss. (Or you can develop a friendship with him and if it blossoms into something stronger, kiss him when you're close.) If you're a guy, your job is going to be a bit harder. Look for a good opportunity to kiss someone:


Kiss someone you think is attracted to you. It's hard to know sometimes, but if you know that someone does or doesn't like you, use that information accordingly.
Work up to a kiss. Work up to a kiss first by flirting. Touch the person's shoulder gently when you're talking to them; compliment an aspect of their eyes; or stare longingly into their eyes.
Be physically close to the person. It'll be awkward if you're five feet away when you move in for a kiss. Get close to the person. Maybe even put your arm around their waist if all the signals you're getting say ""yes!""

, You want your lips to be supple, soft, and smooth before you kiss. Balm your lips regularly before you kiss so that they're free of dry, flaky skin that can distract from the moment. Remember not to:

Apply lip-gloss before you kiss. Lip-gloss can be sticky, glittery, and sweet. You don't want the sticky, your partner doesn't need the glittery, and you don't need the sweet. Your lips are sweet enough!
Apply lipstick before you kiss. Lipstick may look smashing, but it's usually for older women. It can smudge when you kiss, leaving your kissing partner marked.

, If you have the luxury of brushing your teeth right before the kiss, take advantage of it. If not, take a breath mint. Avoid onions, garlic, and other strong-tasting foods right before you kiss.

, Send the signal for your partner to get ready for the kiss by getting really close. Almost uncomfortably close. If your partner moves back, s/he isn't ready for a kiss. If your partner stays where s/he is or moves even closer, you know you're doing something right.

, This one is important. Fix the other person's gaze with your eyes. The eyes are very powerful, and they can communicate a lot of things that we can't with our voice.

When you move in for the kiss, turn your eyes to the person's mouth. You want your mouth to land on the other person's mouth, so you need your eyes if you don't want to botch the landing.
Once your lips are interlocked, close your eyes. We don't know why, but it's kinda creepy to have someone staring at you while you kiss them. It's better just to close your eyes altogether.

, If you try to kiss your partner straight on, your noses are going to get in the way and keep you from actually meeting lips. Instead, tilt your head either to the left or the right slightly so that your noses don't disturb the action your lips want!


If you're sitting next to a person, the side your sitting on should dictate which way you tilt your head:
If you're sitting to the left of someone, it's best to tilt your head to the left.
If you're sitting to the right of someone, it's best to tilt your head to the right.



, The first time you kiss, keep your lips locked for a couple seconds, unless the other person opens their lips and starts kissing quicker. If you let the first kiss last, you'll get rid of some butterflies and set the stage for the next couple of kisses.

, Not at the same time, of course. Start by taking your lips and softly kiss your partner's lower lip a few times. Then, move to their upper lip.


Be gentle. Your partner will appreciate it, even if your heart is beating through your chest. Plus, it will make the kiss more sensual.
Be responsive. Responsive just means respond to what the other person is doing. A kiss is like a dance: you have to move based on how your partner moves.
Go for slow instead of fast. A bad kisser will try to rush the kiss, kissing at about a thousand lips per second. Slow it down, savor every last touch of the lips, and remember to keep your eyes closed!

, Not everyone is ready to start more intimate types of kissing at the same time. If you force a french kiss, you will probably embarrass yourself, and this could ruin your date, and the moment.

Relationships between opposites can sometimes devolve into dysfunctional relationships.For example, if you're the quiet type don't assume you need a partner who is loud. You may never get the chance to speak-up. Rather, search for someone who is relatively like-minded. This way you can both grow together.;
, Try to find someone that you can share your deeper beliefs with. If you are religious and your partner is an atheist, you are likely to face some problems down the road.

You are likely to be more compatible with someone who has the same basic moral values as you.Think about what you want out of your relationship. Do you want to start a family? Where do you want to live? If you want to travel, and you find yourself attracted to someone who wants to settle down, take a step back. While the two of you may get along, you may not be able to build a life together.Sharing priorities in life is a good indicator of being able to share a life together., Odds are there isn't just one person in the world for each of us. Keep an open mind and don't hold out for the ""perfect"" mate.

It may actually be damaging to think of finding your ""one"" soulmate. There is no such thing as a perfect relationship. There is bound to be conflict. Don't take conflict as a sign that you haven't met ""the one.""In searching for ""the one"" we often look for someone who ""completes"" us. Don't expect to find a partner that will satisfy all of your needs. Rather, look for a partner that will encourage you to grow and try new things., Attraction is a good thing in a relationship, but being friends is what will enable you to sustain it.

Find someone whose company you enjoy. You should look forward to spending time with that person. You may find someone attractive, but if you don't like spending time with them, the relationship may not last long.You and your partner should be able to engage in activities that will bring you together. If you both like music, go to concerts. If you both like being outdoors, go camping., In your search for love, don't settle for someone that won't make you happy. Don't think you can change them or make them better. You can't change people.

If you're not happy with someone, it's likely they aren't entirely happy with you. Don't lead them on. Keep looking.Consider your past relationships and any patterns you may have. Think about what worked and didn't work. Try not to limit yourself to the type of people you have dated in the past., The more time you spend with someone the better you get to know them. If you think you've found your soulmate, keep dating. See how that person grows and how they influence you to grow.

It is better to take your time when dealing with a potential life partner. Your relationship will be stronger and better because of it.Don't limit your choices with meaningless restrictions. Try not to pick a partner based on the type of job they have, or their age. While it's okay to have preferences, be open minded in your search for love., The language you use with your partner is important. Open, honest communication is key. Make sure you are both able to have a balanced conversation where each person feels listened to.

When you talk to your partner it should be kind and loving. Even in times of stress or conflict, the language between potential soulmates is calm. Each of you understands and supports the other., You may feel as if you've known your partner for years even if you've only just started dating. If you feel drawn to a person and you want to make them a priority in your life, don't fight it

It's important to be enthusiastic about your partner. If they respond with the same enthusiasm, you're on the right track., Part of being in a relationship is watching the other person grow. Encourage your partner to succeed in their new endeavors.

Be enthusiastic about their choices to take up a new hobby, or make a career change.

It's part of life. How you handle these situations is the test of whether you two are soulmates.

Loyalty is key. You need to know that your partner will be by your side even in the worst of times., Your soulmate will not only stick by your side, but will actively support you in hard times. They will help be encouraging and aware of your vulnerabilities.

Be ready to compromise with your partner. Having a soulmate doesn't mean you have found someone exactly like you. In the case of conflict, you may both tackle problems differently. The goal then, is to do it together and be supportive of one another., In the event that you or your partner have hurt one another, learn to forgive. Rather than holding the incident over your partner's head, forgive them and move past it.

If your partner continues to hurt you, and you wish to remain in the relationship and work things out, hold them accountable for their actions. Working through your problems can make for a stronger, more satisfying relationship.Admit when you're wrong. In the event that you are the one that makes a mistake, own up to it. Any strong relationship requires honesty to thrive. If you and your partner can work things out, you have the basis of a solid bond., While a relationship can't be built on sex and attraction, it is still an important component. Sexual interest and romance are signs of a healthy long-term relationship.

A soulmate will look past the imperfections of his or her mate. They will always see their partners as beautiful., Finding your soulmate is not about finding the perfect person. It is about finding someone you can work with. Ultimately, it is up to you to build your relationship with your soulmate. You both will have to put in time and effort to make it last.

A long-term relationship is something you choose to be in. You are not obligated to be with your partner, you should want to be with them. You must have a positive view of your relationship."

Define love by thinking of what it means to you.,
Look at how the ancient Greeks broke down love into four categories.,
Be aware of moments when you feel love towards anyone or anything.

,
Think of the reasons why you love this person.,
Think about whether you'd feel the same way if the other person's looks were to change.,
Capture your feelings in metaphor, poetry or song.,
Define love like a psychologist: Break love into three components.,
Ask yourself if love is forever.",How to Define Love," If you want, be bold and write down the feelings and thoughts you have about love. The dictionary defines love in several ways in which we use the word. For example, love is:


A strong positive emotion of; affection or pleasure; e.g, ""His joy for her affection for him""
Any object of warm affection or devotion or liking: ""The theater was her first love"". ""I love French food"".
Beloved: a beloved person; used as a term of endearment.
A deep feeling of sexual desire and attraction; e.g., ""She was his first love"" or ""She loves her husband.""
A score of zero in tennis or squash: ""It was 40-love!""
Sexual love: sexual intercourse between two people. e.g. ""They made love."" ""He hadn't had any love in months"".;
, Think of which category of love you feel for the people you are close to.



Agape is unconditional love. It is love by ""choice"" even if you are not pleased. A good example is ""God loves us with our faults"".

Philia is charity or brotherly love, guided by our likes or our healthy or unhealthy needs and desires. This is why Philadelphia is called the ""City of Brotherly Love"".

Storge is the word for family love and the physical show of ""affection"", the need for physical touch. Sometimes it's the love between exceptional friends (the movie Grumpy Old Men for example).

Eros is the physical ""sexual"" desire, intercourse. It is the root word of erotic, and eroticism.

,, Is it truly love you feel or just a connection that can easily be dissolved? If there is something to gain, you might be drawn to that, and your desire for that is confused with love.

, Is it just attraction?

, ""Love is like...""

,



Passion underlies physical desire, sexual behavior, and arousal. This is the physical side.

Intimacy is the emotional aspect: closeness, connectedness, and warmth of friendship.

Commitment is the conscious decision to stick together for the long haul: are you willing to take that step?

, No matter how much time passes by, or what obstacles become present in the path of true and pure love, love will endure. This may be far from reality, but many find it a comforting fantasy.


Although this may be a much more joyous belief to have of love, there are also those situations where love does fail. This can be easily said to have been due to false love of mistaken identity between persons (if lovers are star crossed and are meant to find each other).
Love can cause war; in the cases of love of religion and the love of money; war can cause people to steal and murder, it can lead to suicide and shatter marriage and family life, it can spread disease and give birth to evil.
Also in some philosophical terms nothing lasts forever, not love either. Nothing has ever lasted forever since the dawn of time, nor shall anyone ever know if anything will. This is a paradox since we pledge love for eternity, although eternity cannot by definition have a conclusion. Also if the human mind were somehow able to last eons, human nature dictates that anger, boredom, and/or irritation will end any relationship given enough time.

Only say this if you plan to follow up on your words. Romantic love usually implies a certain level of care and involvement with a person., If you are unsure, then test the waters with words that don't carry so much weight. Say, ""I really like you,"" or ""You make me feel so happy."" ""I love you,"" can be a heavy phrase – but it is not the only way to show someone that you care.


Say that you love something about the person. Try, ""I love the way you dance,"" or ""I love the way you think.""
Gauge how the person responds to the less-serious confessions. If he/she is receptive to your words, and says that he/she likes you a lot too, then there's a higher chance that your confession of love will be well-received.

, Consider that life is short, and that love is a perfectly valid feeling. If you love someone, there will always be a chance that they do not love you back, or that they will fall out of love with you down the line. However, this is a thing that is inside you, and it is a thing that you cannot ignore. Sometimes, the only way is forward, even if you are afraid., Try for a quiet place where the two of you can be alone. Take him/her to a restaurant, or to a garden, or to a sweeping outdoor scene when the sun is setting. Make sure that he/she feels safe and comfortable here.


The particular place will depend on who you're confessing your love to. Choose a place that is special to both of you.

, Confessing your love can be a big deal for both people involved, and it's important to make it special. You can plan it out, or you can wait for an organically intimate moment. The moment might be sweepingly dramatic, or it might be wonderfully simple. Say it when you feel truly inspired.


This might happen during a beautiful sunset after a perfect day together, or when ""your song"" comes on during a big school dance, or when you're both laughing together, happy simply to be with one another.
Watch romantic scenes in movies and shows for inspiration. Analyze the scenes when the protagonist confesses his or her love. Understand the mood that you want to strike.

, You can make a dramatic public confession, if you feel that it's appropriate. Remember, however, that the person you love may not appreciate the unexpected attention. This is especially important if you aren't sure how he/she will react. If you are alone together, then you give the person the space to respond more comfortably.

, Arrange to meet the person, if you don't already have a date to meet up. Ultimately, in the moment, you will need to let things take their course. However, you can certainly set the scene so that your confession is romantic and timely. Make sure that you won't be rushed, and that you know what you are going to say.


You can also write your confession into a letter, if you cannot be with the one you love. This method can still be very intimate, even if it is a little more abstract., Don't confess your love when someone is distracted with something else, or worried about something, or preparing to leave. The words will be more powerful if you're gazing into each other's eyes. If you're already having a special moment together, then you can probably proceed. Sometimes, admittedly, there will be no ""right time."" Get his/her attention by saying, ""I need to tell you something important.""

, When the time feels right, lock eyes with the one you love. Eye contact signals that you are sincere. It also gives you an immediate indication of how she feels about what you're saying, and it should make the two of you feel more connected.

, It's as simple as that. If you truly love this person, then you don't need to justify it or add any frills. If you feel so inclined, however, it never hurts to wax poetic and qualify your love a bit. Above all, be honest and authentic. Only say as much as you feel impelled to say.


Consider explaining the story of how you came to love this person. Say something true, and honest, and sweet. Make it unique, and make them feel special.
Say it casually or earnestly, depending on your comfort level. Make sure that this person knows you're serious.

, If your love says ""I love you"" back: get excited. This is a special time. Ride the wave of loving emotion and take the experience to an even more magical level. No matter what happens, this is a moment in your life that you will remember for years to come.

, Give the object your affections time to process what you've said. In some cases, he/she might confess love right back. On the other hand, if your confession is a surprise, he or she might need to think about it. Listen and be respectful. Don't make any assumptions.


If the person doesn't return your feelings, then that's okay. You may be hurt, but do not be angry. Accept it.

, No matter how your love responds, proud of yourself for telling him/her how you feel. It takes a lot of courage to tell someone that you love them, and mean it. Whatever happens: now they know.

, Bad breath and poor oral health in general can ruin the mood, especially if you can smell your own bad breath during practice sessions.

, Dry, flaky lips can be a turn-off, and feel rough against your partner’s mouth. Drink plenty of water, and apply lip balm as needed to keep your lips soft and sensual.

, This prevents your nose from bumping into that of your partner’s while French kissing.

, This may be your hand, pillow, an ice cream cone, lollipop, or piece of fruit.


Using your hand: Curl your left hand loosely to form the letter “O.” The “O” represents your partner’s lips and mouth.
Using fruit: Bite into a ripe, firm fruit such as a peach or plum. This creates a small hole that resembles a person’s mouth.

Let him know how much you liked it.",How to Make Out with Your Boyfriend and Have Him Love It," Seriously. You won't be in the mood if you're in the parking lot of a Wendy's. Go down to a dark basement with only the glow of the television lighting your bodies or find a hidden cove in a park, where the thought of getting caught gets you in the mood even more. Even the back of a car will do in a pinch. Really, go wherever you need to go to to feel like making out will do the trick.


You should both also be feeling comfortable. No stress, nowhere to go, and ready to hook up.;
, To make your boyfriend love making out with you even more, soften your lips with balm, or just lick them. You can even do this fifteen minutes before you start to make out, so he is more excited and pays more attention to your lips. Just don't lay on the gloss too thick or he'll taste it when he's kissing you.


If you're putting on thick or scented lip gloss, do it at least an hour or two before you plan to make out.

, Let your boyfriend know that you're in the mood. Be playful, but bring him closer to you. Tease him by lightly pushing him, squeezing his shoulder, making cute jokes, or just by playing with your hair and making him want you even more. You can't just transition from hanging out to kissing -- you'll need to flirt a bit to get him in the mood first.


Compliment your man a little while you're flirting. Let him know he looks good.

, Let him know that he doesn't have all of the control. He'll be wowed that you took the initiative instead of waiting for him to make the first move. This will be a huge relief to most guys, who like to take a break from trying to take control of a situation. Grab him, give him a cute smile, and pull him closer until you've locked eyes and are touching bodies.


Maintain eye contact as you pull him closer to you -- along with control.

, Don't give it up too easily. Move in almost all the way and then let him meet you the last 10% of the go around. Pausing the action for just a second will make him stop, take stock of how excited he is, and want you even more. Then, wait for him to pull you closer and start with a soft, gentle kiss without getting too sloppy. As you get more comfortable, use a little tongue, until you're full-on French kissing.


Don't jam your tongue into his mouth right away. At first, move just the tip of your tongue into his mouth, until you've both moved your tongues into each other's mouths and are gently moving them in a circular motion, or with one on top of the other.

, Once you really start kissing, you should move your hands around your man's body. Touch his shoulders, his chest, his waist, his neck, his arms, and any part of his body above the belt. And hey, as you get more comfortable, there's nothing wrong with putting your hands near his groin area to turn him on -- if you have a more intimate relationship.


The important thing is to always be giving his body attention with your hands. You don't have to be frantic about it. Slowly explore his body with your hands as you move closer to him.
Just remember: if all you and your boyfriend have done is kiss and you're not comfortable with doing more, then you don't have to run your hands all over his body or let him touch you everywhere. This may make him think that you're ready for something more.

, If you're feeling adventurous and are comfortable enough with each other, then gently bite your boyfriend or suck on his lips. Remember to bite him very gently at first, and then gradually bite a little harder -- nothing will kill the mood faster than making your man bleed from the lip.


Not every guy likes this move, so don't be discouraged if it turns out that this doesn't work for your man. But if he loves it, then he'll really love it.

, Words are not overrated. Whispering in your boyfriend's ear in the middle of a makeout session will give him a pleasant tingling sensation near his ear and neck, and feeling your hot breath on his ear will make him want you even more. Besides, whispering is just plain sexy -- as long as you know what to say.


Keep it simple. Just say something like, ""I want you,"" ""You're such a good kisser,"" or ""You're so sexy"" will do the trick.
If he does something that drives you wild, you can say, ""I love it when you...""

, It's important to mix things up and not to just kiss, kiss, kiss on the lips. After you've kissed for a few minutes, make your way down to your boyfriend's earlobes and neck. Gently kiss his ears and neck, and if he responds well, you can nibble on them a bit too. If you can master biting just enough to leave a sensation, then your boyfriend will go wild if you can really nibble on his ears and neck.


You can also kiss his neck and lick it a tiny bit, and then blow on it to make your man shiver.

, The head is one of the most sensitive parts of the man's body, so don't ignore it. Run your hands through your boyfriend's hair, gently caress his strands, and continue to play with his hair as you're kissing or when you're taking breaks. Locking eyes while you play with his hair works great, too. Just gently caress his strands as you sift through them with your hands.


Basically, you should always find something to do with your hands instead of keeping them on your lap, so if you need a break from exploring his body, touch his hair, and vice versa.

, Guys love it when you take control and straddle them in the middle of a makeout session. Before you do this, you should make sure that things are already hot and heavy, and that you're touching each other and sitting in a comfortable place, like a couch, or standing near a chair, so that you can comfortably straddle him without breaking up the action too much.Straddle him while you're kissing and put your arms around his neck.
This is not recommended for a first makeout -- you should definitely be comfortable with your boyfriend before you try this!

, If you and your boyfriend are really comfortable with each other, then don't be afraid to suck on his finger while you lock eyes, just for a second or two. This innuendo will be all you need to really turn your boyfriend on, and to show that you're having fun and comfortable enough with yourself to try something new and a little kinky.Don't overdo this move. Just once per makeout session will suffice.

, Whatever you're doing, just remember to mix it up from time to time. Don't keep straddling your boyfriend, kissing his neck, whispering in his ear, or doing whatever it is you like to do. You'll need to switch things up, from the position of your body, to the style of your kisses. You can kiss him just on the lips, French kiss him, kiss him while gently nibbling his lip, kiss other parts of his body, or do all of the above, as long as you keep things fresh.


Don't get stuck just French kissing without moving your arms or changing positions. That can get old fast.

, Don't be afraid to smile afterwards and show him that you enjoyed the make-out session. Gently kiss him on the lips, stroke his hair, or just tell him how much you like him afterwards, so he feels confident and knows that you really like hooking up with him. You don't have to be too modest, or pretend the makeout didn't happen. In fact, it's hot to acknowledge it.


Give him a playful smile and say, ""That was fun.""

It isn't very likely that one of you will get stuck.Modern braces tend to be less obtrusive than the ones in classic movies where two hapless teens get stuck together.However, a stray wire or bracket could poke your partner, which could kill the mood.;
, Most orthodontists will give you some of this after attaching your braces. It’s good for keeping your braces from cutting the inside of your mouth while you’re getting used to them. Wax will also keep the wires from your braces from poking out, reducing the chance of them getting caught on your partner's braces or face., He or she might not have kissed anyone with braces before. Explain that he or she will need to tell you if your braces are poking him/her. Tell your partner s/he probably shouldn’t touch your braces with the tongue or lips -- this can get really painful. Even though this can be embarrassing to talk about, it’s better to do it before it happens.

, Be gentle. Try lots of small kisses at first so that you get used to kissing someone with your braces in and s/he gets used to kissing someone with braces. If it’s going well, keep going and try for longer kisses. Figure out what you like best and do it.You might want to avoid too much tongue when making out, as getting it caught on your braces will not be fun.
Focus on using your lips to caress your partner. Ask him or her to do so as well.Keep your kissing soft and gentle to avoid getting tangled.

, You might be tempted to go for a passionate love-bite or two in your usual make-out sessions, but it's a good idea to avoid that with braces. You could end up cutting your partner's skin with your braces.


Keep your braces away from areas with hair, which might get snagged., Making out isn’t just about kissing -- it’s about getting close to another person. Don’t do anything that you’re not comfortable with, but if you’re already kissing someone, chances are s/he won’t mind if you stroke his/her hair, cheek, or shoulder.

, When you snuggle or cuddle with someone you like, your body releases a chemical called oxytocin, which helps you feel connected to that person.Bump your make-out sessions up a notch by cuddling with your partner as you make out. It's a pain-free way to make things sweeter.

, Making out isn't just about lip contact. Tell your sweetie how you feel about him or her. Offer a compliment on his great new t-shirt or her beautiful eyes. Express your feelings for your partner with your words as well as your kisses, and you can't go wrong., If you and your partner like each other, braces are not going to be a big deal. If you’re both relaxed, chances are you won’t have problems.If you’re too stressed out, you might bump teeth or harm you or your partner. Take a deep breath and just have fun!


If you're feeling nervous, try telling yourself something positive, like ""Lots of people make out and don't get their braces caught. I'll be okay.""

, Even though you might worry that you and your partner might get stuck together if you both have braces, it almost never happens. If by some crazy chance it does, stay calm and untangle yourselves. Figure out where the braces are linked and unhook them. You’ll probably both need a trip to the orthodontist afterward.Try laughing about the incident instead of letting it frustrate you. Sure, it's embarrassing in the moment, but it'll be a funny story later.

, Your orthodontist will have warned you about eating hard foods and the possibilities for breaking your braces. This means that your partner can’t be pressing too hard against your braces, either.Avoid bumping your teeth together. You could crack your braces or cut your partner., There’s nothing less romantic than food or plaque on your teeth when you’re going to make out with someone. Work slowly and carefully to make sure that your teeth and mouth are sparkling clean, whether you have braces or not!, In addition to brushing, daily flossing will help keep your mouth clean and ready for kissing. Use an orthodontic floss threader to help you get the floss under and around your braces. You may also want to use a water flosser, like a WaterPik, to help flush debris away., Use a mouthwash that contains fluoride twice a day after you brush and floss. Mouthwash can get into the nooks and crannies around your braces and help flush out any leftover debris. Fluoride-containing mouthwash can also help protect against cavities."

View ""random girls"" as humans, not as lips to make out with.,
Avoid looking for girls who are drunk or high.,
Understand the difference between flirting and sexually harassing someone.,
Know that everyone has boundaries.",How to Make Out with a Random Girl1," While you may just be looking for a fling or a one night stand, it's important to remember that the girls you're looking at are people, too. Just because a girl is flirting with you doesn't mean she doesn't have a right to say no to whatever you want to do with her.;
, A good majority of the people are drunk, especially in the night, and this is one of the reasons that makes kissing and hookups easier. However, it's common sense to not to go for girls that are too drunk or high, since she has trouble making decisions in this state.


If she isn't sober, she may:

Not walk properly.
Mumble or slur her words to the point where she's hard to understand.
Sit quietly at the side of the sidewalk or bar, or even be asleep.


Although it may be easier to get a girl who's under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it's not only short-sighted and shows a lack of character, but also illegal. A girl who is under the influence is unable to give consent to making out or anything further, and engaging in sexual activities with anyone under the influence is legally considered rape or sexual assault.
This doesn't mean you can't approach any girl who's under the influence for any reason; just don't approach her with sexual intent, which includes actions such as kissing or making out. You can talk to girls under the influence, as long as you don't take advantage of them being under the influence.

, Flirting is fun, playful, and you can usually tell that the girl is comfortable because she'll be laughing and smiling. However, harassment is continuing to advance on her sexually when she's getting more and more uncomfortable with you. Hints could be like pulling away when you try to touch, not playing along with your sexual humor, not talking much, looking away, making negative facial expressions, and so forth. If that's the case, leave her alone and approach other girls.


Not everything is a sign that she's totally uncomfortable with you - for example, when she's not comfortable with your physical escalation but is still talking to you. These hints indicate that you should tread slowly and carefully.

, Different people have different personalities, social conditioning and sexual boundaries. Some people are more open about meeting new people and some may not be. Don't take it personally when they reject you or don't show interest.


Avoid getting angry when the girl sets boundaries; you don't want to take the phrase ""bad with rejection"" to serious extremes. Nobody has the right to force anyone else into doing something they don't want to do.

Compliment genuinely. Saying something like ""Nice boobs!"" or ""Great butt!"" can creep girls out. Use common sense and tread slowly, and then calibrate on the basis of response from the girls. It also slowly gets you in a social mood.

, Remember, it's not the words but the intention behind the words that consists of more than 80% of the communication. Your prime intention should be to have fun; the rest is all secondary. However, use common sense before going to extremes and saying something extremely vulgar or sexual.


You don't have to say things that don't resonate with your personality or intention. If you did, the words will not be backed by intentions. It helps a lot to say something that you genuinely find it fun or sexual from a non-needy and fun mindset.

,



Be assertive. It's very important that you are assertive and lead the conversation. Women are subconsciously very attracted to guys who can lead.

, Emotions are accentuated by details; the more the details, the higher the intensity of the emotions. Have you noticed that your emotional concentration becomes higher, congruent to the topic you are trying to comprehend or explain, when you explain or listen things in detail? It's descriptive psychology. Talking about sad things makes you more sad, talking about happy things makes you more happy in the same way talking about sexual things accentuates related emotions.

, This is gold if you know how to do it properly. During the interaction, touch and hold her. You can't expect to make out with her when you haven't even touched her. There are many ways to do it; try whichever you find easier to do.


Touch her hands. Say something like, ""Let me see your hands. I want to compare the sizes of our hands"".
Hug her. A good way to know if she is comfortable with you is to hug her first. If she pushes you off or doesn't hug you back, though, she's probably not comfortable.
Try kissing her. If she is comfortable with hugging, try going for a kiss on her cheek, and if she's comfortable with that, then a peck on the lips. If she backs up or starts talking the second you get close to her face, she's not comfortable with a kiss.

, This can be very inducing and effective to make out with her.

, If she is responding well and having a fun conversation, then try to go for the make-out - just pull her closer and go for it. Only do this if you're sure she's comfortable with being kissed, though - just about any girl who got kissed by a random guy would feel uncomfortable if she didn't know he was going to kiss her.

, Sometimes, making out can get hot and heavy and lead to something further. It's important to take steps to make sure you two are protected and both comfortable with sexual acts.


Read the subtle hints to know if she wants to hook up. Asking her crudely (such as ""Wanna bang?"") is going to make her feel like a slut because of societal conditioning. Practice reading subtle hints to know if she's ready or not. However, don't take these hints as signs of consent; always ask her directly if she wants to have sex.

If she says no, respect it. Continuing with the absence of consent is legally considered rape.



Protect both of you against STDs, and her against pregnancy.

Treat them well.,
Get into that exhilarated mode.,
Go out with wing-men.",How to Make Out with a Random Girl3," Women are normal human beings who make mistakes, use the bathroom, have sweaty genitalia, have all kinds of irrational fears and go through the same mental hurdles. Don't put them on a pedestal, or they will most likely walk all over you.


Don't treat them badly, either, like some ""bad"" boys do. Treat them right and with respect.

, Ever felt so exhilarated from the inside that you don't care what anyone thinks of you? Ask yourself what gets you into that mode. Getting into that mode will increase your chances to succeed, since when you are in that mode, a shift in your consciousness happens and you don't perceive things as good or bad, just fun. In fact, when you are in that mode rejections make you go even deeper into exhilaration. Below are few things you can try to get into that mode and see what works best for you.


Machine gunning. Approach and talk to bunch of people in a small amount of time. Doesn't matter who; it doesn't have to be girls, just talk to random people.
Pushups. Do push-ups right where you are, busy streets, malls, public places.
Lie down on the sidewalk.
Dance in the middle of street or in front or random people.
Don't just approach all the attractive girls, but approach everyone. It could be guys, bartenders, old people. It's yielding to approach everyone, as it not only keeps you in a social mood but also catalyze the transition from unsocial mood to approaching attractive girls.

, Having some friends is not only attractive to girls, but also helps a lot to keep you in a social mood, which is essential when it comes to attracting girls.

, A good and friendly introduction gets you off on the right foot.

, You might start with small talk, or you can ask the stranger how to get to your destination. That's the easiest way to get a stranger to talk to you, without him/her being overly suspicious or uncomfortable.

, That's the easiest way to attract someone; if they seem open to chatting more, keep the conversation going.

, That's not very hard and awkward after the compliment is given. Just stay in tune with their cues for whether they want to talk to you or not; if they seem into the conversation, continue, but if they're trying to end the conversation, move away from you, or using very closed body language, give up and move on. You can't win them all.

, Honestly, many people aren't going to be too keen to kiss somebody they just met. But if the setting is right and they're showing you with their interactions and body language that they're into it, you might be in luck. See if they're showing signs of physical interest, like touching you or leaning in to you.
, When you feel ready, close in for a kiss. That is when the stranger supposedly feels very comfortable and you do too. It's hard to decide when this happens.
, You are in a world with your partner, remember, not yourself. Read their cues, and respond to them; if they start to pull away, break the kiss.

, Again, read their cues to see if this is appropriate and consensual. Lick the lips of your partner when you want to add tongue. If you've read the other WikiHow articles on how to French Kiss, you'll know that you need to show signs of tentative tongue touching. Remember, this could be your last time seeing that person.

, A big part of sharing a good kiss is knowing when to end it, to stop things from getting awkward and keep enjoyment high for both of you. When the time comes, pull back your head slowly, keep eye contact, and smile. See if you can segue into more conversation (or dancing, or cuddling, or whatever else strikes both your fancies).


Making out with a stranger is unlikely to indicate a long-term relationship - so, read the signs, and keep kissing as long as you're both happy to. When it's time to come up for air - or even part ways - do so.

Leave your partner wanting more.",How to Make out in a Movie Theatre," If you want to have the best make out session in the movies, then you should pick a movie that will make you and your kissing partner get that loving feeling. Now, you may kind of both already know that you're just going in there for some lip action, not to see the latest Oscar nominee give a breathtaking performance. You should pick something romantic, or something boring and nondescript, so you have lots of time to kiss without missing out. Just avoid anything too gory, scary, or important. You probably don't want to get caught making out during a movie about hate crimes or civil rights.


Any summer blockbuster, romantic comedy, or action flick is perfect for making out. You don't want your kissing partner to turn you away, saying, ""Hang on, I want to see what happens.""
You should also be careful not to pick a new movie on the day it comes out, or the theaters will be packed. Try to pick something that has been out in theaters for a while, or something you've never even heard of. This will make it more likely for you to get some privacy.
Additionally, if you're old enough, go see a Rated R or PG-13 movie. You want to minimize the amount of small kids in the audience or it'll be a real buzz kill.;
, Do you want a large popcorn with extra butter — or a long make out session with extra lovin'? Maybe you can get some M&Ms and save them for later, or a large soda to quench your thirst, but you should avoid going all out when it comes to concessions, or they'll get in the way of trying to make out. You don't want to kiss or caress your partner's face if your fingers are covered in nacho cheese or popcorn butter.


If you really can't do without your popcorn, maybe go back for it at half-time, after you've had some time to kiss.

, Though it can be hard to get true privacy in a public place, you can definitely try to sit somewhere more private so you don't get angry stares and so you don't get reprimanded by Grandma. Find two seats that are in the back so people don't see your smooching silhouettes instead of what Denzel Washington is doing. Beyond that, try to sit toward the wall, in a row without any people in it, or which isn't surrounded by people. This will make you feel less shy about making a move.


If you know the theatre won't be packed, try to come in a little late, so you can stake out a private spot without having a family of 8 sit down behind you at the last minute.

, It'll be awkward to try to lock lips before you even really start touching each other. Guys can casually drape their arms over the seat at the start of the movie and then ease the arm over their girl's shoulder as the movie progresses. You can also move close enough that your outer feet or arms are touching, so you can break the touch barrier a bit. If you're in one of those fancy theaters with a movable arm rest, move it up so you'll be sitting even closer to your kissing partner.


Another thing is that movie theaters are always cold. Guys can ask their girls if they're cold, and when they say they are, it's an excuse to cuddle up even closer together.

, Once you've moved closer together, you can start to touch each other a bit. You can hold hands, making sure to caress the fingers from time to time instead of letting your hands sit there like limp fish. You can also gently touch each other's knees or arms as you take it to an even more intimate level.


Just remember to give it some time. You don't have to hold hands the second the movie starts. Make it feel natural instead of rushing into it — unless you feel like the most natural thing to do is to start making out right away.

, Though it can be hard to make eye contact when you're both supposed to be looking ahead, intently watching the movie, it'll also be pretty hard to kiss without actually looking at each other. After you've been touching each other for a while, or even if you're making jokes to each other about the movie, you can slowly turn toward each other and make eye contact. This will let your kissing partner know that you're interested in more than just the movie.


Lock eyes for a second, and look away. Alternately, you can let your eyes linger and let your partner know that it's time for the kissing to begin.

, Now it's time to angle your heads and move closer to each other until your lips almost touch. You can put your arms on your partner's hips, hands, or even his or her face to complete the gesture. If this feels like too much, you can just start with a simple kiss and then use your hands once you turn up the heat. Continue to look into your partner's eyes and get ready for more.


Just keep in mind that, if you and your date haven't really made out yet, the movie theatre may not be the best place to start. Trying to make out with someone you haven't kissed yet in the theatre can catch the person off guard, and it can be a little uncomfortable to get to know someone's kissing style for the first time when you're in the dark.

, Just press your lips together gently and softly, and enjoy the sensation of your partner's lips on yours. You can move one lip above your partner's and the other in between his or her lips, so your lips fit in together instead of being directly on top of one another. You can just linger here for a few seconds without expecting anything more. Don't pucker your lips too much, but relax and enjoy this sweet, simple sensation.

, This is what you've been waiting for all along — and we're not talking about crazy fight sequence in the middle of The Avengers. Once you lock lips, the sky is the limit. Gently slip your tongue into your date's mouth and begin French kissing. At first, take it slowly instead of jamming your tongue into your date's mouth. Once your tongues are in each other's mouths, gently explore the territory.

, You don't have to totally grope your date, but using your hands while you're making out can kick things up a notch. Caress the sides of your partner's face while you're kissing, touch your date's shoulders or arms, and just keep your hands active to keep things interesting. You don't have to go overboard — there's also something to be said for a simple sensual kiss that doesn't require a lot of arm movements.


You can also place a hand on your partner's thigh or caress his or her knee.
Try stroking the side of your date's neck once you're kissing.
Using your hands and exploring your partner's body (in PG areas) can help enhance your make out session, but don't take it too far. You are in public after all, and you don't want to get escorted out of the theatre after your make out session gets X rated.

, You don't have to make out for thirty minutes or for the duration of the movie without stopping. In fact, you'll probably enjoy kissing a lot more if you take breaks and come up for air from time to time. You can slowly pull away from your partner and take a few breaths and make eye contact before you move back in for a kiss. You can also just move away a bit and return your focus to the movie until your next make out session begins. This will build anticipation as you eagerly await the next time you'll kiss.


You can even smile and stroke your date's hair when you take little breaks.

, As the credits roll and you pull away from your partner-in-kissing-crime, you should smile, stroke your date's face, and let him or her know how much you liked it. You can even make a joke about how great the movie was, or say that you wouldn't mind seeing it again to pick up on some of the more subtle scenes. You can also really heat things up next time by making out somewhere a bit more private. But until then, you can eagerly anticipate the next time you head to the big screen.


Squeeze your date's hand as you leave the theatre. Walk fast so the other patrons don't recognize you! And get ready to plan your next sexy trip to the Cineplex.

Opt out of movie theaters or group dates, and instead shoot for secluded situations like a quiet movie night at home, an outdoor picnic, or an otherwise deserted space.


Resist the urge to cut the lights completely. You might think that total darkness will ease your nerves and hide any slip-ups. For a first-timer, though, it'll actually make things a lot more difficult — you can't see where you're going, and you'll want to be able to gauge your partner's reaction. Save the full darkness for later sessions when you know each other better.
If you're alone in a bedroom or a basement, you can dim the lights a bit without being too obvious about it.
Set the mood, if you like. If you know that someone you like will be coming over solo later and that there's a good chance you'll be making out later, then you can make sure your room is neat and tidy, that there's no chance a parent or roommate will interrupt, and that everything smells nice and is conducive to making out.;
, If you sense a make-out coming on, put some effort into looking and smelling your best. It'll boost your confidence, and make you irresistible. You don't have to be too thorough about this or it'll make you more nervous, but if you feel and look your best, you'll have a better chance of having a great make-out session. Here's a quick checklist to go over:


Do a quick clean-up. Even if you don't have time for a full-on shower, you can still do small things like wiping your nose, brushing your teeth, and splashing water on any areas that are starting to smell a little ripe. Reapply deodorant while you're at it.
Add a subtle scent. For guys, apply one or two sprays of cologne around your throat and chest. (Don't go overboard, since strong scents are almost unbearable at close quarters.) For girls, use a few sprays of perfume or apply a scented body lotion to your neck, chest, arms, and legs.
Freshen up your mouth. Cover your bases by chewing gum or breath mints right before making out -- if you can be subtle about it. If you don't have anything on-hand, swish some water around your mouth and spit it out. While you're at it, fight off chapped lips with lip balm or chapstick. If you're on a date before you think you'll make out, try to avoid eating any overly-pungent foods.
Touch up your makeup (girls). Take a quick second to make sure you don't have smudgy mascara or uneven foundation. Avoid too much lipstick or gloss, or your kissing partner will taste it.

, If you're already comfortable kissing someone regularly, move it into making out simply by continuing the kisses and trying some of the techniques in Part Two. If you haven't kissed this person much before, though, initiating a make-out session might take some extra maneuvering. Here are some ways to let the other person know you're interested:


Find excuses to get close. Putting your body as near as possible to the other person's is a pretty strong hint. Sit close if you're on a couch or in a car, or hold hands and stand with your body completely against theirs. Make it extra obvious by staring deep into his or her eyes.
Reveal slightly more skin. If you're wearing a cardigan or jacket, take it off casually. You could also undo the top button of your shirt, roll up your sleeves, or pull up your hair, so that your neck and chest are more exposed. Voluntarily showing more skin signals that you're comfortable around the other person, and you're willing to be more exposed around him or her.
Get handsy. Before you start kissing, make your intentions clear by using your hands to start closer contact. Hold hands, offer a shoulder or foot rub, play with the other person's hair, or lightly trace your fingers over the face or throat.

, Is he or she incredibly eager to start kissing and pretty experienced when it comes to locking lips? Or is this his or her first time too, and he or she is acting even more nervous than you feel? If your partner is really ready to take it to the next level, relax and let him or her take the lead. But if you see that you're the one who is doing more of the hinting, touching, and talking, take a deep breath and muster up all of the confidence you have.


Fake it until you make it. If you act like you know what you're doing, your partner will be convinced that you're at the top of your game.

, Slowly bring your face toward the other person's, maintaining eye contact until you're a few inches away. Then close your eyes, and start a kiss. If he or she seems interested, you're probably clear to move onto making out; if you run into hesitation, though, it might be best to try another time. If it's your very first kiss, then you may be a little nervous, but take a deep breath and let your lips touch your partner's at a slight angle. This will make it easier for you to use your tongues when you're both ready.


Take a deep breath, smile a little, and slowly lean in toward your partner. You don't have to get it right the first time and remember, he or she may be just as nervous as you are!

, Keep things interesting by changing up how you kiss. Don't alternate techniques too often, but do it often enough to shift gears as soon as you feel the other person losing interest. Try playing around with these variables:


Pressure: Alternate between soft, gentle kisses and harder, more insistent ones.
Speed: Slow kisses are a good start to making out, and they're nice for taking a subtle breather in the middle. To convey more passion, though, you can speed up to quicker and deeper lip work.
Tongue: Try French kissing, or gently touching your partner's tongue with your tongue, to heighten the intensity. More than anything else, keep your tongue in motion — don't let it just sit in your partner's mouth like a limp noodle. Make small darting movements, or sweep it around your partner's tongue in smooth, circular motions.

, As you keep going, try kissing your partner in other areas. If it seems like your partner likes being kissed in a certain spot, make a mental note to revisit. Some popular areas include:


Jaw
Earlobes
Throat
Neck
Collarbones
Shoulders
Inside of the wrist, or palms

, Passion deserves a little time and respect and you should never waste the first time! Make sure to keep your hands active and to keep touching your partner's body so you really connect. Here are some special touches you can try:


If your partner is male: Hold onto his head, and slowly and lightly move your hands to the back of his head. Rub your hands through his hair and down his shirt. Grab his biceps if you feel confident and give it a squeeze while kissing him. You can also pull yourself closer to him letting his hands wrap around your back a little more to make it steamy and sexy.
If your partner is female, wrap your arms firmly but gently around her and rub up and down her back (or lower back if she responds happily). If you're comfortable enough with your partner you can hold her by the waist or grab her butt. Give it a try and if she responds in a negative way, stop immediately. If she seems happy about it, you can go on. You can also cup her face between your hands, gently sweeping your thumbs over her cheekbones.

, Don't think that you have to be passionately locking lips or kissing the entire time you're together. It's okay to take a break, laugh together a little bit, get a glass of water, or just make yourself more comfortable. This doesn't mean you should stop and talk about how hard the math homework was, or switch the subject to something else decidedly un-sexy. But if you're starting to feel like you need a breather, don't sweat it. Chances are, so does your partner.


Pull away and smile, run your fingers through the other person's hair (this works great for guys and girls), and keep your hands on the person's body.
You can even take a break by whispering something sexy in your partner's ear. The feel of your hot breath on his or her ear will turn up the heat for sure.

, Remember, he or she may be just as nervous as you are! Your compliments will not only be a confidence booster, but they will probably also encourage more kissing.


If your partner isn’t good at kissing, be patient. Continue to use the techniques that you’ve learned and give your partner time to follow your lead.
If your partner does something you like, encourage him or her by smiling and saying, “I love it when you ___”; to continue reinforcing the better aspects of their kissing, respond to these moments by squeezing them tighter, making a brief “mmm” sound of approval, etc. Unless you are remarkably comfortable with each other, do not criticize your partner’s kissing abilities.

, When you're ready to say goodbye, keep things positive so that it's more likely you'll be kissing again soon. You may be feeling a mixture of emotions, but focus on the ones that make you feel amazing about what just happened. Here are some things to try before you say goodbye for the night:


Let your partner know you had a good time. A simple ""That was awesome"" will probably make him or her feel just as great as a canned, pre-written compliment. Say what you feel and don't worry about sounding too elegant or aloof.
End with one more kiss. Make this one quick, light and gentle, especially if your making out was heavy and intense toward the end.
Kiss her hand. If you've just wrapped up making out with a girl you adore, lock eyes and slowly bring the back of her hand up to your lips for a light kiss just before she leaves. It's an old-world, courtly gesture that most girls find romantic.
Leave your partner wanting more. Tell him or her that you can't wait to hang out again and make it clear that you mean you can't wait to make out again too. The second time will always be even better than the first.

However, relationships that leave one or both parties feeling unsatisfied just can't last. Make time for intimacy to keep the fires burning strong.If you have kids that are a bit older, tell them that you've both had a very long day and you're tired so you're going to go to bed.
If you have younger kids, get them into bed at a fairly early hour.
Avoid only being intimate very sporadically, like when you take trips or set aside a ""date night"" once or twice a year. This is not good for a relationship.;
, Make sure that everyone involved is happy and giving full consent before getting too serious. This is important for both men and women. If your partner is drunk enough to see giant purple mole-rats, you should not be getting intimate. Get a ""yes"", not an ""I guess"".

, Don't expect sex to be like it is in porn and don't expect your partner to look like a supermodel. And especially don't expect yourself to look one way or another. This will make you and them insecure and uncomfortable, reducing pleasure for everyone involved.

, If you want to find out more about what feels good to your partner, do some research. Read romance novels written for that gender or read advice columns online to find out ideas of what feels good and what doesn't.

, We don't mean lose weight or get bigger (insert body part): your partner is with you because they already think you're sexy. When we say be appealing, we mean have good hygiene. Wear decent clothes. That kind of thing. Weight is subjective but very few people are turned on by the smell of week-old sweat.

, Watch how your partner reacts to things. If they respond well to something you do, do more of that! If they seem uncomfortable, stop! Look for the subtle cues they give you, like putting your hand in a certain place. You can even try mimicking the things that they do to you as oftentimes it is their way of asking for something in particular.

, Slow down everything about your intimate relationship. Build up to intimate acts slowly, by embracing the subtle art of The Make Out and other types of foreplay. You should slow down the act itself too! This extends and heightens pleasure for all involved parties.

, You do, of course, also need to get enjoyment from your intimate relationship, but focusing on your partner and making sure that they are satisfied and feeling amazing will go a long way towards improving the relationship and making them want to reciprocate. Go out of your comfort zone.

, We all know the few basic places our partners like to be touched, but don't forget to explore their whole body! People are sensitive in all sorts of places and to all sorts of different degrees. You may find that your partner goes nuts if you kiss them on the back of their knee! You never know!

, Being a great kisser is important and being a bad one can be a real turn-off. Master the art of kissing before trying to master anything else!

, Don't let your intimate relationship become a routine. Avoid using the same positioning or the same location or the same time of day. Making a routine takes away a lot of the romance and enjoyment for everyone. Break out of your mold and switch things up every now and again to keep your romance alive.

, Human sexuality, like most things with humans, is incredibly complex. Everyone is different. And because we are all different, the range for what is actually normal is incredibly large. Never close your mind to anything, because you may be surprised at how much you or your partner enjoy something you never considered before. Try things, and if you enjoy them, keep doing it!

, Really repetitive motions do not work in intimate situations. Her genitals are not an elevator button that you can just push repeatedly and hope to get results. The same can be said of her nipples. Think circular movements and variations in pressure, direction, and motion, and you'll be fine.

, Men get stimulated with sensations on their penis, so you'd think that women would be stimulated by sensations in their vagina, right? Unfortunately, it's not that simple! Most women don't get a whole lot of pleasure from just vaginal stimulation alone. Wikipedia the clitoris.

, When you're dealing with sensitive parts, be gentle unless she specifically asks otherwise. Nibbles and pinches here and there can feel amazing for some women but not all, and you don't want to get smacked.

, Guys, you know you love it when she makes all of those little moaning sounds. It lets you know how much she's enjoying it, right? But did you know that she likes to hear you make sounds too (for the same reasons)? Maybe not so much with the grunting, cause it can get a little cave-manish, but say things like, ""Oh, that feels so good...""

, No, really, turn up the heat. Women have a harder time feeling as much pleasure when they are cold, studies have shown.Get under a toasty warm blanket or crank up the thermostat if she really seems to be having trouble and you've tried everything else.

, Don't use your intimate relationship as a weapon in arguments and don't ever actually promise sex and then not deliver. This is cruel. It would be cruel if he did it to you and it's cruel if you do it to him. This also doesn't work in your favor, since it teaches him to associate sex with negative emotions and disappointment, which will really hurt your relationship long-term.

, The major complaint that guys have about women is the classic ""dead fish"". Get yourself moving when you're being intimate. Guys need less work, but that doesn't mean they need no work. Keep your hands and legs moving, caressing him, when you're together and occasionally take some initiative and take control of the situation. You'll blow his mind.

, Take off all the makeup and go easy on the hairspray. Guys are attracted to your softness and they'll be much more turned on if they can get their fingers through you hair or kiss your cheek without getting a mouthful of powder. Gross! Ramp up the softness even further by shaving and moisturizing. We recommend a long-term Bag Balm regimen.

, Guys watch porn. Almost all of them. And they think about sex a lot. This is just a fact of life. Because they do this, they get ideas, fantasies of things that really turn them on. If you want to make your man a happy man, let him act out some of those fantasies every now and again. Wear a school uniform. Play doctor. Talk to him about what he fantasizes about and then make it a reality. He'll never know what hit him.


Just be sure that whatever fantasies you decide to play out, you're comfortable with what you're doing. Everyone should be happy!
You can be nonjudgmental and still say no to a request. These things are not mutually exclusive.

, Waking up to your soft body and warm kisses can be a great way to surprise your man. You can do this on a weekend morning or be really spontaneous and do it in the middle of the night (when you know you can sleep in in the morning). He'll enjoy the spontaneity and the break from the norm.

, The person to whom you intend to show affection must become your single point of attention. You will be a great lover if they feel they are the only person in the world when they are with you. That is the impression you are trying to make when you begin with focus.

, You must be upbeat when expressing your sentiments to them, whether about them personally, the situation, or the condition of the world at large. Be an uplifting presence that helps them see the better things around them, especially about themselves

, Make sure to listen and see how the other person is responding to your attention at every step--the object here is to find the correct tempo that the other person is capable of hearing, seeing and fully feeling your expressions of affection. This is about them, not about you having a stage and acting out--you are always seeking to understand their experience of you so you can again make it even better.

, You must express optimistic sentiments with a passion that is infectious to them. Bring them a wave of positive emotions to carry them towards pleasures in themselves and the world around them and they will be yours forever.

, Life is way too hard and complicated. We often get totally sucked in to our problems and forget to see all the wonderful things in the world. But that's what our partner is there for: to remind us of the good things by making us laugh and helping us find the humor in tough situations. Be that person for your lover.

, If you really love the one you're with, and you watch them closely enough, you'll come to realize that they have certain habits and ticks that you will come to adore. Most people only see these things after a long time in their relationships, but if you get a head start now, you will start acting more loving with your partner and feeling closer to him or her.

, One should learn to compromise. Being a lover means sharing. It's only fair that you do because love is about sharing, and growing. Treat others how you want to be treated.

Learn about safe sex.,
Understand your rights.,
Recognize gender role stereotypes.,
Understand the power of choice.,
Learn to love and accept your body.,
Accept your sexual desires as normal.,
Own your gender identity and sexual orientation.,
Dismiss the critics.,
Maintain the power.,
Form your own beliefs on empowerment.,
Talk to your partners about your desires.",How to Be Sexually Empowered," In order to be sexually empowered, it is important to understand the potential consequences of sex and how to protect yourself from them. The more knowledgeable you are about sex, the better equipped you will be to make the right decisions for yourself.


There are a wide variety of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that you may be exposed to when you choose to have sex with someone. Using a condom can help protect you from transmitting an STI.Pregnancy is also a potential consequence of heterosexual sex. There are a variety of ways to prevent pregnancy, so choose the method that works best for you. Barrier methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps provide protection during each sexual encounter, while hormonal birth control methods such as pills, shots, patches, and implants prevent pregnancy for longer periods of time.;
, By law, you have the right to consent to each and every sexual experience you have. If anyone ever violates this right and forces you to have sex without your consent, this is considered rape.Don’t feel like you have to do anything you don’t feel comfortable doing, no matter how badly your partner wants it. Being sexually empowered means you make the decisions that suit you best.
The law protects you from more than just unwanted sex. If anyone ever touches you in any way that you are uncomfortable with, you have the right to say no and to report the incident to the police if the person does not listen. You should also report any incidents of verbal harassment.
If you are raped or sexually assaulted, understand that it is never your fault. No matter what you were wearing or how you were acting, you were not asking to be assaulted.

, Gender role stereotypes are beliefs that a community holds on the way individuals of a specific gender should look or act. These beliefs are often untrue and can be very damaging to individuals who do not conform to the stereotypes. Most people are introduced to these beliefs at a very young age, so it's important to step back and challenge everything you think you know about gender roles.These stereotypes often reinforce the beliefs that people should only be attracted to member of the opposite sex, or that men should hold the power in a heterosexual relationship.
It is important to recognize the double-standards that exist in gender stereotypes and to form your own opinions about them. For example, men who have multiple sexual partners are often encouraged by their peers, while women who have multiple sexual partners are often chastised for being promiscuous.
Individuals who do not fit within the confines of traditional gender stereotypes often feel ostracized and misunderstood. If this is the case for you, seek out support from like-minded friends and loved ones, or from a support group. There are a variety of support groups and hotlines for members of the LGBTQ community, for example.

, You don't necessarily need to be sexually active in order to be sexually empowered. While everyone finds empowerment in different ways, the most important thing is that you decide what you will do with your own body. If you choose not to have sex, that is your choice and you should not let anyone persuade you to do anything you don't want to do.

, Many men and women feel shame about their bodies, and some haven’t seen every part of their bodies. In order to be sexually empowered, you have to see and love your body.


To improve your body image, try looking at yourself naked in a mirror. Smile at yourself and give yourself compliments. Remind yourself of all of the wonderful things our body is capable of. The more you do this, the more comfortable it will become for you., It’s completely natural to have sexual feelings and you should embrace that. If it wasn’t for sex we wouldn’t be here! If you feel any guilt or shame about your sexual desires, realize that there is no reason at all for anyone to make you feel that way.


Just because something is stigmatized by society, does not mean there is anything wrong with it. For example, many people, especially women, are taught that masturbation is wrong or sinful, which can cause them to become confused and hold negative feelings towards sex and their own bodies. The reality is that most women do masturbate and it is perfectly normal.If you are having sexual desires that would involve harming others in any way, you should not embrace these. A therapist can help you understand where these desires are coming from and help you find more appropriate outlets for them.

, Individuals often face discrimination for failing to conform to gender stereotypes or for not being heterosexual. While it is certainly not an easy thing to do, fighting back against this discrimination and being proud of who you are is essential to becoming sexually empowered.Do not let others tell you what your role should be in a relationship or who you should be attracted to. These decisions are entirely up to you.

, Many cultures, religions, and individuals stigmatize people who do not conform to the norms of that community. If your community is unaccepting of you, you will face a lot of challenges in your journey to be sexually empowered. Eventually you will need to decide whether you will conform to the norms or ignore everyone who does not accept you for who you are.Always think about your safety first. If you ever feel endangered in any way, call the police. You have the right to be safe and to express yourself!
It is up to you whether you want to share details of your sexual orientation, gender identity, and lifestyle with your family. Many people feel the need to do so in order to be their true selves, but for others, the consequences are not worth it. It's important to consider your own comfort level when deciding who to come out to.
If you know that some people in your life are likely to be more accepting than others, consider coming out to them first. They can offer you the support you need and help guide you as you talk with more and more people.
For some people, leaving the unaccepting community is the best option. Even if you do not completely cut ties with the community, you may be able to find a supportive group of like-minded people outside of the community. Look online for support groups, hotlines, or even chat rooms that are dedicated to supporting people like you.

, In order for any sexual act to be empowering for you, it needs to be your choice. If someone else is forcing you to do something, it will objectify you, not empower you.If you feel pressured by an individual or by society as a whole to perform a sexual act, you no longer have the power. The choice needs to be entirely un-coerced in order to be empowering.
Remember that you always have the right to stop consenting to something as soon as it becomes uncomfortable for you.

, Everyone has different beliefs on sexual empowerment. What some people find sexually empowering, others may find objectifying. Because of these varying opinions, it is important to take some time to consider what you personally find sexually empowering.You should always base your decisions about sex on your own opinions on empowerment. Just because you want to be sexually empowered does not mean you need to have multiple sexual partners; it merely means that you can choose to have multiple sexual partners if you wish without feeling bad about it. If this doesn't feel right for your body, then it will not be empowering to you.
In addition to deciding about your sexual preferences, you will need to decide how much you want to display your body. Some women find it empowering to pose in sexually suggestive poses or dance in suggestive ways, for example. Other women may not find these things empowering at all.

, When you find yourself in a sexual relationship, communicate with your partner about your sexual desires and preferences. If you both understand what the other wants, you're more likely to have a satisfying sexual experience.Don't be shy about telling your partner if you don't like something.
Remember that your pleasure is just as important as your partner's and one should not be prioritized above the other.
Don't make demands or intimidate your partner in any way. He or she deserves to be sexually empowered as well, and your sexual empowerment should not come at the expense of your partner's.

Express admiration for your partner's appearance.,
Say ""I love you"" - after physical intimacy.,
Make your partner feel special around other people.,
Spend time together each day just talking.,
Listen to your partner as much as you can.,
Express your feelings in writing.",How to Be the Most Romantic Boyfriend1," While this may seem unimportant or even superficial to some, nearly everyone has insecurities about their appearance. Hearing from our partner that we are attractive to them can give a big boost to confidence - and romance.Mention how nice they look before they leave for work.
Look into their eyes and tell them how beautiful they are.;
, Studies suggest that a post-sex declaration of love is more meaningful to those looking for a long-term commitment. The logic is that by that point the confession is more likely to be sincere, rather than prompted by ulterior motives., When you're in the company of friends or family, don't abandon your partner. Instead, make sure you communicate verbally and physically with them. Hold hands, check in with eye contact, and include your partner in conversation. This helps to confirm that your partner is special not only when the two of you are alone, but when you're with other people important to you.


If your sweetheart feels shy around your friends and family, make efforts to mention their news or accomplishments. For example, you could drop a line about how your girlfriend has nearly finished her Ph.D., or how she got a raise at work. Do be aware, though, that there may be some topics your partner would prefer not to talk about, so don't overdo it.

, Experts say at least 30 minutes a day of open communication, without distractions, helps couples maintain a strong connection. Topics can be anything, ranging from talking about your day, to expressing fears, desires, and hopes. You can discuss your relationship and what you love about each other, but don't feel this needs to be the subject every day.


Open up to your partner. Talk about the things you're excited or passionate about. This conveys trust on your end, an indication of your love and emotional intimacy., Stop what you're doing, put aside your cellphone/book/remote control, and face your partner as they talk. Give your partner 100% of your attention, even if it may seem unimportant: your partner has a need to talk, and your being there to listen helps build trust and love., Tell your partner how much you love them and value your relationship. Keep it short and sweet. Your partner will not only appreciate what you're saying, they'll also value the effort you've made in putting your feelings down on paper.


If you can't work your way up to a love letter, start with text messages that communicate nothing other than love (no practical information allowed!). Don't be afraid to be a little corny: tried-and-true phrases like ""I love you,"" ""You're my love,"" or ""Hi angel,"" never get old. Or, you can just tell them how excited you are to see them later in the day."

, Sometimes, the phone can be a great opportunity to talk about things that you might normally find it awkward to talk about in person. If you're chatting on the phone, it might be easier to engage in a little risqué chat about your sex life. Talk about things you want to explore with your partner, and talk about what turns you on.


If you're not sexually active yet, and even if you are, having phone sex can be a new outlet to explore together.

, If you have to be apart regularly, it's a good idea to have a regular phone date at a set time, so you can still feel like you've got quality time that you're spending together. Set a half hour or an hour each day so you can catch each other up on your days, talk about the future, and spend a little time talking.You might want to talk every day, or you might not.

Try out a recipe together and try to make it at the same time. Talk each other through it and laugh at your successes and failures. Text each other pictures of the end results when you're done and see who made it better.
If you can, Skype or other video-chatting makes this even better. Even if you're not saying anything, it'll be like you're in the room together.

, Even if there's really nothing to talk about, just having your partner on the line can be a romantic gesture. Even if there are long periods of silence, it can be comforting and romantic to know that you're both together, even though you might be miles apart. Talk before you fall asleep and keep the phone on your pillow.


Make sure you're in the same network if you're going to spend loads of time just listening to each other breathe. This can be a romantic gesture, or just a huge waste of money and minutes.

Know your limits.,
Know your man's limits.",How to Be Really Sexy with Your Boyfriend1," While being sexy can help add spice to your relationship, it's important to know when you've had enough. Here are some signs that you should cut back:


If you're feeling sad or depressed. There will be days when you ask your boyfriend for a hankie instead of some hanky-panky. If you're feeling so upset that you can barely function, know that it's okay to put sexy time on hold. If your boyfriend knows and loves you, he'll understand.
If you're just not in the mood. There will be days when nothing you do will make you have that lovin' feeling, and that's okay too. Forced sexiness is worse than taking a time out for ""me time"" instead of ""sexy time.""
If his actions make you feel uncomfortable. If you think he's taking your romance too far, it's time to back off. If you notice that you're feeling uncomfortable a lot, then it may be time to end the relationship.;
, Though it may seem impossible that there will be a time when your boyfriend isn't in the mood, accept that he's human and may not be feeling so sexy. Here are some signs that he may not be in the mood for your sexy moves:


If he's tired or sick. If he looks physically unable to have sexy time, chances are, he doesn't want it. If he'd rather hit the hay instead of have a roll in the hay, don't force him to do anything he doesn't want. He may feel guilty for not being up for your advances, which will only make everyone feel worse.
If he's stressed out. Though sex can be a stress reliever, if your man is so worried about his new job that he can't focus on you, give him some alone time.

Be a source of physical comfort when your partner needs it.,
Let affection be a lighthearted thing.,
Make time to embrace your partner once a day.",How to Be the Most Romantic Boyfriend2," If your partner is upset, pull them in for a hug rather than a kiss. Hugs communicate unconditional love and support, whereas kisses require reciprocation, which may be unfair to ask in a time of distress.


Hugs also work when your partner isn't upset.

, Romance doesn't have to be so serious: it can also be humorous and playful. What's important is to show love and appreciation.Put your arm around your partner's waist when you walk. (This may be more romantic than the casual ""arm around the shoulder."")
Hold hands while walking, watching TV or a movie, or sitting on the bus together. Reach for your partner's hand at unexpected moments, too, such as across the table at dinner.
Put your arms around your partner's waist when you are standing behind them.
Play with your partner's hair. Go easy, though – you don't want to ruin an immaculate coiffure!

Sneak in some surprise gifts.,
Return to the source of your love.,

Lend a helping hand with chores.",How to Be the Most Romantic Boyfriend3," This is a classic gesture with good reason: research suggests that flowers naturally lift our spirits, stimulating our mood and even positive memories., The next time you're shopping on your own, pick up a few tiny presents. They needn't be expensive; instead, look for small things that remind you of your sweetheart. Then, the next time they're having a difficult day, you can surprise them with one of these. The gesture communicates care and forethought, and is sure to be appreciated and remembered.For example, you could pick up a book or a magazine, a nice bar of soap, a pair of gloves, or a picture frame.

, Remembering what first drew you to one another can help you both appreciate your relationship. Plan a ""revisitation"" of your first date or meeting, and if you can, keep it a secret.

, While everyday surprises are highly important, don't forget about birthdays, Valentine's Day, anniversaries, etc. Take time out on these days to celebrate together. Plan ahead to find the right gift and make any reservations early.


These days should be special from start to finish. Breakfast in bed is a perfect way to mark the occasion, and don't forget to acknowledge how nice the day was before going to sleep.

, As unromantic as it sounds, doing the chores your partner usually does (without being asked to, of course) can make them feel very loved and cared for.

Let your partner know you're thinking of them throughout the day.,
Encourage your partner through the day.,
Update each other on how things are going.,
Plan a date on the fly.,
Send pictures.,
Send texts sparingly.",How to Be Romantic on the Phone2," If you have to be apart and can't have an actual phone conversation, just sending a short ""Thinking of you"" text can be great way to remind your partner that you care. Here are a few romantic texts you can send through the day:


""You looked beautiful this morning. Can't get you out of my head.""
""Can't wait to see you later today! Counting the minutes.""
""Guy at work keeps talking about his cats. Miss you.""
""I've been thinking about last night all day. Can't wait to do that again.""

, If you know your partner's going to have a rough day at work or school, send them encouragement throughout the day. This helps to remind your partner that you're in their corner, and that you care about them. Be a helpful voice with the following kids of texts:


""You're going to kill that presentation, I just know it. Good luck!""
""Good luck with the test! Thinking of you!""
""Only three more hours left till you get to come home.""
""It's almost Friday! You can do it!""

, When you're apart throughout the day, it's always nice to know what your partner is up to. Ask for updates on how they're doing and let your partner know how your day is going as well, with a reasonable number of text messages. Just keep each other up to date:


""Just finished my essay. Yikes. At least it's done? Can't wait to see you tonight and blow off some steam...""
""It's such a beautiful day on campus! Flowers! Birds! Wish you were here to see it.""
""I got to work and Jim had eaten the last donut and drank the last of the coffee and now I'm just looking at Buzzfeed and wasting time. What are you doing?""
""Everyone on the train looks grim this morning. Monday. How's yours going?""

, When you're out and about and a date occurs to you, send a quick text to your partner to see if they'll be up for it. This is usually good for dates with someone that you've had dates before, not a first date. It's an easy and quick way to get in touch and plan something:


""When you get home from work, I'll bring you pizza?""
""I'm downtown later. Meet me for a drink at our spot?""
""I'm having the worst day. Here's what I'm thinking for later: You. Me. Some wine. A dark room....and Empire Strikes Back on the new Blu-Ray. Yes?""
""It's a beautiful day. Let's meet in the park and go for a walk!""

, If you're looking good, send your partner a picture to let them drool. If you see something funny while you're walking around, send it to your partner to let them laugh with you. Sending pictures can be a fun, easy, and quick way to keep in touch without having to do a whole lot of work.


Be careful with sending picture messages that are x-rated. Make sure you know and trust the person you send pictures to, and remember that it's never romantic to send unsolicited naked pictures, and it can be dangerous.

, A few texts a day can be great, but make sure you save some stuff to talk about in real life, too. Your dates might get kind of slow if you blow it all talking via text. Some people will enjoy sending hundreds of text messages a day, while others will be annoyed by the constant contact. Every relationship will be different. Find out about how much your partner texts and try to keep it within bounds. Don't annoy each other.

Be spontaneous.,
Make the plans solely for the two of you.,
Splurge on your girlfriend.",How to Be Romantic with Your Girlfriend2," You don’t need any specific reason to plan a romantic date. While Valentine’s Day and your anniversary are perfect times to have a romantic date, you should have some consistency more often. You need to make time. If the two of you work or travel on weekends, plan an extravagant and romantic date for a Tuesday night.


Rent a convertible and drive around.
Check local concerts and surprise her with a date night.
Cook her favorite meal and have it waiting for her when she gets home during the week.

Be bold.,
Be spontaneous.,
Remind him of how sexy you are when he's not around.,
Show off your sexy body.,
Have sexy food.,
Tell him how sexy he is.,
Leave him wanting more.",How to Be Really Sexy with Your Boyfriend2," Bold and sexy are close cousins. You can't be sexy if you're afraid try do anything wild or out of your comfort zone. To be sexy with your boyfriend, you can try being bold in the following ways:


If you're talking to him on the phone, surprise him with casual dirty talk. He'll be surprised--and turned on--by your sudden sexy mood.
Take risks. Try an adventurous food, go sky diving, or go mountain climbing. This will make you a more open--and more sexy--person.
Be open about what you want. If you're really in the mood for something, telling him what you crave. He'll respect you for sharing your true feelings and will be turned on in the process.
Be bold, but know when to strike. Surprising your boyfriend with something sexy is a plus, but trying to get it on when he has a bad cold or just isn't in the mood is a big no no. Before you go in for the kill, ask yourself if your boyfriend is really in the mood for what you have to offer.

, Some of the most sexy times you have with your boyfriend will be totally unplanned. Leave room for sexiness any time in your life, even if you're just having an ordinary dinner or watching a television show. Here are some ways to be spontaneously sexy:


If you're feeling sexy, take the initiative. Even if you're not in the middle of a sexy activity, let your man know by kissing or touching him in a subtle way. And if subtlety fails, try for some dirty talk to let him know what's on the table. He'll be more than just pleasantly surprised.
When he comes home from work, turn off all the lights, pull the shades, and lay naked on his desk. When he turns the lights on he will get a real surprise. However, do not do this unless you plan on further sexual activities. A guy is not going to be surprised by a naked girlfriend on his desk and then just walk away to read the newspaper.
Surprise him in public. Though you don't have to go for it in the back of your car or some untoward place, a special touch or kiss at the right time can show him that you're ready for more. And if you're isolated and not offending anyone, you make time for romance.
Remember that a good soldier is always prepared for battle. Be ready for sexy time--any time. Try to keep your legs shaved, your skin washed, and your breath nice and minty as often as you can so you'll be ready to get it on.

, You can be sexy with your boyfriend even when he's on the other side of the country. If you two are sexy while he's away, he'll be even more eager to return. Here are some ways to keep it sexy when he's far away:


If he is out of town, arrange a video chat with him. At some point during your conversation start doing a striptease. Don't take off too much too soon. Keep it a tease.
Send him sexy--but tasteful--text messages at night.
Give him a sexy picture to take with him, so he can be reminded of what he's missing.

, Even when you're not in the bedroom, your boyfriend should be thinking of what your body has to offer. Here are some ways to be sexy without having sex:


Walk in a sexy way that emphasizes your derriere or your cleavage.
Take him hiking or do another physical activity where you can really strut your stuff. He'll feel sexy just by looking at your body.
Dancing can be very erotic. Perhaps learn to belly dance or strip tease; this type of dancing will give you sexy poise and irresistible body confidence.

, There's a reason that ""food"" rhymes with ""nude."" The right meal can go a long way in helping you be sexy with your boyfriend.


Bake for him. Make your boyfriend something sweet like a cake, a muffin, or cookies, and then feed it to him in the nude. Your nudity will no doubt lead to further activities.
Give him chocolate. Kiss him while putting it into his mouth. Afterward, simply walk away without saying anything. He will surely follow.

, Don't be so busy acting sexy that you forget that your man is sexy, too. Reinforce this by simply telling him exactly how sexy or manly he is.

, Don't throw your appetizer, main course, and dessert on the table at once or your boyfriend will have a stomach ache. Instead, be subtle with your sexiness without throwing it all on the table. There's a difference between being sexy and being easy. Here are some ways to leave him wanting more:


Don't move right into sex after a makeout session. Let him linger over your body so his passion builds.
Don't have sex with him every time he wants to--unless you're in the mood, of course. Instead, be sexy when you're feeling right.

Have a sexy face.,
Wear underwear that makes you feel and look sexy.,
Keep it simple.,
Look provocative--not trashy.,
Have sexy feet and hands.",How to Be Really Sexy with Your Boyfriend3," In spite of what you may think, your face really is the first thing your boyfriend notices, so keep up a sexy appearance and the rest will follow.


If you feel comfortable wearing makeup, put on just enough to give your eyes a smoky look and your lips a nice luscious tint.
Give your boyfriend sexy glances. Just the look in your eyes can let him know how you really feel about him.

, Knowing that you have it on can make you feel sexy, or showing your man a hint of what you have planned for later can make him excited for the rest of your night. Some sexy items include:


A thong, lacy underwear, a push up bra, pearls, a corset, knee-high socks, or spandex.
Avoid any uncomfortable fabrics that can lead to chafing, which is the opposite of sexy.

, You don't need to always wear designer thongs or teddies. As long as you wear something out of the norm that shows more skin, your man will think it's sexy that you're wearing it for his benefit.


Don't wear anything so elaborate that it will be impossible to remove. This may lead to frustration and other mishaps in the bedroom.

, If your clothes are revealing more than they're hiding, your boyfriend will be embarrassed to be seen with you instead of turned on.


Make sure your dresses and skirts are like a good story--short enough to keep things interesting, but long enough to cover everything.
It's good to show a little cleavage, but not so much that most of your chest is exposed.
Showing a little bit of bra strap can be sexy, but exposing your entire bra is too much.

, Care for your other extremities so your man will be even more excited by you.


Take care of your hands and fingernails so your man will be turned on when he holds them.
Keep your feet nice and fresh so you smell sexy in the bedroom.

"
Love your looks.,
Be confident.",How to Be Really Sexy with Your Boyfriend4," If you think you look sexy, your boyfriend will think so, too. Instead of asking him for reinforcement about your looks, be proud to show off your beautiful face and body.


Pick at least three attributes you love about yourself, and show 'em off. If you love your legs, wear a shorter skirt, and if you think your arms are to die for, expose them in the perfect tank top.
Have fun with your body. Dance in front of the mirror to your favorite song, and you'll see how much fun it is to inhabit your body.
Be healthy. Eating right and exercising can have a positive impact on the way you think about yourself. Exercise can also be an opportunity to do something sexy with your boyfriend, like taking salsa lessons.
Pay attention to the way you talk about your body. If you're wearing a new dress, instead of asking your boyfriend, ""Do I look okay in this?"" tell him, ""Don't I look fabulous in this?"" He'll be turned on by your love for your looks.

, There's nothing sexier than showing your man how confident you are. Instead of spending time telling you that you're amazing, he'll be busy loving your natural ease with yourself, which will make you look even more sexy. Here are some ways to be confident:


Be aware of the things that make you a beautiful, unique, and talented individual. When you're having doubts, remind yourself of these qualities. It may even help to write them down.
Be confident--to a point. Part of confidence is accepting that you are a flawed individual. You're already awesome, but there's always room for improvement. Your boyfriend will be impressed not only by your confidence, but by how comfortable you are in admitting you're not perfect.

Realize that love isn't something that can be forced.,
Make the most of the time you are single.,
Make the most of the time you are dating people.,
Be prepared to wait.,
Take it easy and slowly when you do fall in love.,
Enjoy the journey as much as the outcome.,
Become a good listener.,
Learn to communicate well.,
Match your strengths to your love's weaknesses and match your love's strengths to your weaknesses.,
Look forward to the future together.",How to Be Patient in Love," It takes time to connect with the person who is going to become your best friend, your helpmate, your partner in life. Rushing it wouldn't do any good because you might end up choosing someone who isn't right, just by being speedy. Allow love the time to blossom and the right person to walk into your life.;
, Use this time to learn more about who you are and what you want from life. Define your purpose. Find the things that give life to your passion and do them. The great thing about having time to fathom these things for yourself is that you'll end up doing things around people who have the same passions and interests as you; and amid those people may just be the person who is going to connect deeply with you.

, Not all the people you date will end up being compatible with you. Moreover, even some of those you start planning a future with won't end up in that future. Some of these people may end up being a good friend or just someone you once knew, but each of them brings you closer to the person you will spend your lifetime with. In the process, you learn more about yourself in the context of a relationship and what does and doesn't work for you.

, True love waits. Sometimes there is nothing else that you can do than than to wait––for the end of college, for the end of a relationship, for the end of long distance lives, for the end of a career move, and so forth. Whatever the reason, if it's true love, it will contain great patience before you can finally both come together as one.

, Patience is again a virtue when it comes to the speed at which you fall in love. While it's great fun to feel the dizzy heights of falling in love, it's a phase that eventually turns into a more steady pace of daily routine, by which stage you need to have cemented firm friendship, deep commitment and acceptance of each other's foibles as much as your features. Taking it slowly allows both of you to really get to know each other and to be accepting of the limitations and less liked things, early on.

, Falling in love and staying in love is a journey, not a destination in itself. Each part of this journey requires patience and a willingness to accept that a lifetime is a long time and there needs to be room for change, growth and maturation as well. Patience will turn out to be a big part of this journey, helping both of you to stay connected and understanding of one another for many decades to come.

, It doesn't matter if you aren't one already, it is a skill any person can learn once they choose to do so. Being a good listener brings with it many benefits, including helping the other person to feel genuinely heard, actually understanding what motivates the other person and providing space for healing discussion during conflict. A patient heart that listens is often at the center of a healthy, loving relationship.


There are plenty of great resources available on how to be a good listener, and wikiHow is a great place to start: How to be a good listener, How to become a better listener and How to relearn listening to your spouse.
Learn to listen without interrupting. It may be hard to wait your turn but it is vital and it is a mark of respect toward the other person.

, Communications lie at the heart of any relationship but especially so for those in a loving commitment. Conflict is an inevitable part of a relationship but it isn't to be viewed as solely a negative; conflict allows you get across things that need to be dealt with and then to resolve them together. Patience is the glue behind resolving any conflict the two of you may have, and sometimes you may need a huge does of patience to see things through to a satisfactory resolution. Improving your communication skills and your conflict resolution skills are key to achieving this effectively.


Learn to count to 10, breathe deeply and bite your savage words back when a conflict arises. If you need to, ask to leave the discussion until you feel ready to resume it later and take some time out to think things through.
Avoid being accusatory when you talk to your love. A patient approach looks for the good faith reasons behind actions and accepts that every person has their limitations.

, You are a team in life, a force of togetherness and mutual support. Patience helps you to recognize both this and the reality that each of you needs to buffer and support the other by bringing both of your strengths to the fore. Be patient with your partner's weaknesses and be ready to make up for them with your strengths; in turn, expect the same from your partner.


For example, you're a whizz with budgeting and your partner is flaky with money. Guess who gets to do the bills weekly? Yet, you are flaky with getting anywhere on time, but your partner is an ace at timeliness, so guess who gets to organize your schedule?

, Foresee what may unfold for both of you and plan together. Be patient about obtaining your shared goals, hopes and dreams. Rushing into them isn't advisable, for all good things take time to grow and bear fruit. Know that while it may seem hard now, with both of you resolving to make things better, to put your finances, efforts, skills and abilities toward the goals and dreams, you will both get there. As Rumi once wrote, ""lovers are patient and know that the moon needs time to become full."" Plan together, work, share and laugh together, and reassure one another that the things you both seek will come to pass.

Be flirtatious, no matter how old the relationship is.,
Touch him.,
Gently tease him.,
Jog his mind by creating a stimulating conversation.,
Increase the flirting if there is an obstacle to your relationship.,
Take the lead sometimes.,
Let yourself be silly.",How to Be Playful with Your Boyfriend," This means small touches whenever you can, light kisses on the arm or neck, and genuinely playing with him (making goofy faces at him and soft nudges are encouraged)! Let him know that he's all you see.


If someone else tries to flirt with you in your boyfriend's presence, politely reject that person and flirt more with your boyfriend to make it clear that you're all about him.;
, Human touch is a powerful tool to show love and get him thinking about you. Try playful kissing, snuggling, gentle pokes or taps, or suggestive touches.

, If he slips up on words or drops an entire container of applesauce, try a light joke and a smile. Keep it lighthearted, and allow inside jokes to develop (e.g. that he is clumsy, or that you can run circles around him at basketball). Smile the whole time to make it clear that you love him, including his teasable parts.


Some people are more sensitive than others. Teasing is okay when he smiles/laughs, or teases right back, and nobody feels bad about it. If he seems upset or withdraws, it's time to stop.

, Talk about news events in an area you both like (e.g. science discoveries, arts, and culture), or books/articles you read.

, Perhaps another guy hit on you in front of him, he has to go far away for a week, or he's sad that you're busy with school. You can make it clear that you love this relationship by flirting more and showing how much you care. This will help him feel secure in the relationship (and help you cope too).

, Guys can love it when their partner takes the initiative to do something fun (and it can be incredibly sexy). Try taking his hand and pulling him along somewhere, planning a surprise vacation, and letting him wonder what you have in mind for him.

, It's okay to go out on a limb, be a little quirky or ""childish,"" or do silly things for no reason.

Be proud of yourself for caring.",How to Be Passionate," If you want to really be passionate, then you have to be determined to learn everything there is to know about your passion and to continue to gain knowledge and know that there is always more to learn. Read all of the books, articles, and material that you can, take classes, read interviews, and do whatever you can to really feel like you have an understanding of what it means to succeed in your passion.


Remember that your job is never done. There is always more to read, more to learn, and more to do. If you feel like you really know everything there is to know about your field, then you risk getting complacent.
Subscribe to journals or relevant literature in your field so you are always getting the most up-to-date information about your passion.;
, Though you can learn a lot from reading or watching videos, there’s something to be said for getting more hands-on information from people who know their stuff. Whether you’re talking to an expert in your field or another person who shares your passion, you can always get more advice, insight, and a fresh perspective from the people around you. Don’t ever think you have all of the answers and always make an effort to hear others out.


If you don’t know anyone in your field, ask other people if they can introduce you to people who can help you or email people to see if you can come in for an informational interview or just ask a few questions. You’ll find that most people are happy to share their insight, especially if it’s about something they care a lot about.
Talking to more people in your field can also help open up your mind to the idea that there’s more than one way of doing things when it comes to your passion. This can help you approach your passion with a more nuanced perspective.

, If you want to really be passionate, then you have to have a plan. Though you may think of passion as this crazy, wild, unbridled thing that can’t be curbed, if you’re really serious about carrying it through, then you should have a plan for how to succeed in realizing your dreams and furthering your passion. Create a series of little goals that lead up to a larger goal so you feel motivated to succeed along the way.


Having a plan when it comes to your passion can help you articulate your dreams and give you a more concrete vision of what you need to do to make them happen.
Plus, if you’ve written out all of your little goals, then you’ll feel more motivated to reach them and more driven to make things happen. If you only have a vague idea about how to be passionate, then it’ll be harder to proceed.

, If you really want to succeed at your passion, then you should have a routine that helps you do that. Of course, they say that passionate people wake up early, but many night owls do their best work in the evenings, so this may not apply to you. Find a routine that makes it possible for you to pursue your passion and to make the most of your time and abilities, and stick to it.


Make a daily schedule for yourself. This will make it more likely that you’ll stick to a routine. For example, if you want to be a writer, set aside time to read and to write every single day, no matter how busy you are.
Of course, it can’t all be hard work. You may have to plug in some “fun time” into your schedule too. Taking a break to relax from pursuing your passion can actually revitalize you and give you more energy to pursue your dreams.
If you have a friend who is pursuing similar goals, you can schedule time to work together, if your passion isn’t a solo pursuit. This can help motivate you and make you feel accountable when the time comes to stick to your routine.

, If you really love and care about something, then you can’t just keep it to yourself. If you recognize an injustice in the world, then you should make an effort to stand up against it, and to let the world at large see why this cause is important. Whether this means protesting, picketing a business you don’t agree with, respectfully telling your boss why a new company policy is not environmentally friendly, or boycotting something you don’t agree with, it’s important to stand up for what you’re passionate about if you really want to see it through.


Sure, it may not always be easy to stand up for what you believe in or to go against popular opinion, but if you really do care about your cause, then you can’t just follow the path of least resistance all the time.
You should be proud of yourself for going against what’s popular or right. Remind yourself that your cause or passion is bigger than you are and that you have to be willing to take a stand if you really do care.

, If you really care about something, then it’s likely that you won’t be able to stop talking about it. Though you don’t want to be the person who only talks about the thing he loves most in the world, you also want to be able to share how much you love your passion with the people around you. Whether you’re an English teacher who loves literature or a doctor who really cares about his patients, there’s no shame in letting your passion shine through or in telling other people you know about how much you love what you do.


Plus, sharing your passion with others can help you get a new perspective on the thing that you love. Maybe you’ll get another insight into how you can do what you do even better.
Sharing your enthusiasm with others can also remind you about how much you love whatever you do. Keeping it all to yourself can make your pursuit feel lonely or unrewarding. Sharing it with others can help you see why it’s important.

, Another key part of being a passionate person is being able to learn from your mistakes and using them to make you better at pursuing what you love. You don’t want to be the person who makes the same mistake again and again and who takes no steps to do better the next time around. Whenever you make a mistake, ask yourself what you could have done differently and how you can use that experience to succeed the next time around.


Don’t feel like you’ve completely wasted your time just because you failed. No failure is completely worth it and you can use it to help you the next time around. No experience should be discounted, and the effort you put into failing one time can actually benefit you the next time around.
If you’re given constructive criticism, make sure to use it as much as you can. Don’t be too proud to think that you have no room for improvement.
Make sure to take the time to regroup after every failure or mistake and to stop and ask yourself what you can do differently the next time around. If you blindly move toward your next venture after failing without stopping to ask yourself how to prevent the same thing from happening again, then you’re not likely to have different results the next time around.

, If you really care about your passion, then you won’t let a few—or a few hundred—rejections stop you from doing what you really care about. People who truly care about their passions know that rejection is just part of the game and they learn to push past it and to continue to do what they love. If you expect to succeed after the first few tries, then you’ll have a hard time really making the most of your passion.


You can be the type of person who wallpapers your room with rejection letters as motivation or the kind who just shrugs and throws them away. The most important thing is not to let them define you.

, If you really want to be passionate, then you have to be the kind of person who gets excited about whatever he or she is doing. Don’t be embarrassed to talk about how much you love whatever it is you’re doing, to get all misty-eyed, to look forward to what lies ahead, and just to own whatever it is you’re doing. If you’re really passionate, then you have to get excited about what you’re more than the average person.


When people ask about what you’re doing, you shouldn’t try to downplay it; there’s no need to hide your excitement or how much you care. If you’re more concerned about looking cool than sharing what you care about, then you’ll never be truly passionate.
It can help to hang out with other people who are equally passionate about the same cause, or who are just passionate people who like talking about the things that make them tick. This can make you feel more comfortable about sharing your own feelings.

, People who are passionate tend to have an optimistic nature and believe that they can do whatever they want if they work hard enough. Though you will have setbacks, it’s important not to let them get you down and to focus on all of the good things you have to look forward to. Avoid whining or complaining too much and focus on talking about the things you’re excited about instead. Try to have a smile on your face, to radiate positive energy, and to focus on your achievements instead of your setbacks.


If you catch yourself making a particularly negative comment, then try to counter it with at least two positive ones. Surely there must be something you can be happy about!
Spending time with other positive people can help you be more positive in your own life. If everyone around you is a Negative Nancy, then yeah, you’re much more likely to be down about everything.
Make a gratitude list by writing down all of the things you are thankful for. This can help you see all of the things you have to be happy about.

, Being brave doesn’t mean fighting off enemies or dodging bullets; it means being willing to go out on a limb to fight for what you believe in. It means stepping into uncharted territory and not knowing what you’ll find out there. It means taking risks and going out on a limb even if you’re not sure if you’ll succeed. It means putting yourself out there and opening yourself up to criticism, even if you have a feeling it will hurt. Truly passionate people are known for their bravery.


Being brave also means being willing to challenge the status quo and to point out when you think a common way of doing things isn’t right after all. It means challenging authority when you think it’s necessary and making an effort to fight for your beliefs.
Being brave also means being willing to fail. You’ll never get anywhere if you play it safe. This can mean something as simple as interviewing for a position that sounds exciting but out of your comfort zone.

, People who are passionate don’t get distracted by too many side projects that have nothing to with achieving their goals. They approach their passions and life with a laser-like focus and are able to be selective about the projects they commit to so they don’t overextend themselves and lose time they could have spent on something they care about. They know how to block out the hate, the noise, the doubt, and the questions that can keep them from moving forward.


Though passionate people still know how to relax and have fun, they won’t get sidetracked for too long from doing what they planned to do. For example, if you’re really passionate about volunteering, then you won’t get persuaded into going on a trip to the beach with your friends instead of volunteering at an animal shelter, as you promised to do.
Passionate people realize how hard they have to work to accomplish what they have to accomplish and they don’t tend to procrastinate or forget the big picture for very long. That said, if they do get distracted, they don’t lose sleep over it and help themselves get back on track.

, Passionate people know that there’s always room for improvement. They work hard to learn new things, gain new experiences, and to be the best versions of themselves that they can possibly be. They know that this takes time and they are prepared to recognize their own flaws and to work to address them; they’re okay with admitting that they’re not perfect and that they have room for growth.


People who are complacent are happy with being exactly the way they are. Passionate people are always asking themselves how they can be better.
Passionate people are also comfortable owning up to making a mistake. They’re comfortable admitting that they aren’t perfect.

, People who are truly passionate, whether it’s about a single cause or just about their everyday lives, are curious about the world around them. They ask lots of questions to gain more knowledge and are comfortable admitting when they don’t know the answer to a question. They try new things, try to get multiple perspectives on any given issue, and they’re motivated enough to do research on their own so they can learn even more.


Passionate people feel like they can never stop learning, whether they’re twenty-five or seventy-five. They continue to try to get a better sense of the world, while they’re comfortable admitting that they’ll never have all of the answers.
Passionate people recognize the value of having many meaningful connections so they can be exposed to many different opinions about how the world works. They aren’t satisfied with getting just one answer to anything.

, One way to really go above and beyond in your passion is to become a mentor to other people who are just starting out in your field. Once you feel like you’ve really cut your teeth and have enough experience to share it with others, then you can take some people who share your passion under your wing, whether they are younger siblings, junior employees, or even people who ask you questions online. This can help you take on more of a leadership role and to further your passion by spreading the joy to others.


Once you feel established enough in your passion, you will feel a real joy in being able to help other people succeed in your field. You can think of it as sharing the love.
You don’t want to be one of those people who is so obsessed with his passion that he doesn’t want to help other people succeed in it because he thinks that there are too many actors/writers/bloggers in the world already.
If you know someone who is coming up in your field, you may even want to offer to help that person.

, Another way to go above and beyond in your passion is to share how much you care with a wider audience over social media. As long as your messages aren’t too annoying or repetitive, sharing your interests, posting your essay, blogs, videos, or other relevant information to show how much you care, or just writing an occasional message to get the word out can get more people involved in your cause.


Just be ready for the fact that not everyone will care or agree with your message. That’s part of having a passion, though, right?
Make sure people feel like you’re trying to send a good message instead of self-promoting too much or doing things just to get attention.

, If you’re really passionate about something and want to devote yourself to it, then you will have to make some sacrifices along the way. Though you may not want to become monomaniacal (like Ahab and his whale) and give up absolutely everything for whatever it is you love, you should be prepared to give up some other things that you may love in order to really put your passion into practice. Here are some of the things that you may have to sacrifice:


Your social time. If you really want to succeed in your passion, then you may have to give up some of that time you love spending with your family, your friends, or your significant other.
Your sleep. Many people who live and breathe for their passions aren’t known for getting ten hours of shuteye a night.
Your free time. You may love lounging around, watching TV, or throwing a Frisbee to your dog, or reading magazines, but you’ll have to give some of that up.

, Though it’s important to make sacrifices if you really want to pursue your passion, you also have to be able to find a healthy balance that lets you live your life without too much stress or heartache. If you’re serious about following your passion but have other obligations, such as to your job, your friends, your family, or to your health, then you have to find a way to make time for your passion without completely giving up all of the other things that do matter to you.


It may help to make a schedule to let yourself have time to both pursue your passion and make time for your family and other important things in your life. This can help you transition between activities a bit more smoothly.
Of course, you can give everything else up and devote all of your time to your passion. But chances are that you’ll need a bit of a break or a change in scenery from time to time, or you may feel completely drained and exhausted when it comes to doing what you care about most.

, If you really want to be passionate, then one thing you have to work on is living in the present moment and enjoying what you’re doing. Though it’s likely you have plenty of goals and a vision of the future that you want to have, if you really want to be passionate, then you have to work on giving in to the moment and really enjoying all of the effort you’re putting into your passion right when you’re working on it.


For example, if you’re working on a novel, your main goal may be to get it ready to send to an agent, who will hopefully sign you and then try to take it to the publishers when it’s ready. However, if you spend too much time stressing over the next steps, you may not be able to enjoy how much you love writing in the moment.
Plus, if you’re too worked up about the future while you’re pursuing your passion, you won’t be able to do as good of a job as you would do on it if you gave it your all in the moment.

, At the end of the day, the most important thing is that you’re really proud of the work that you do, whether you’re an Oscar-winning actress or someone who works her butt off to show up to every casting call. Most people out there don’t really have anything that they’re passionate about and you’ve gone the distance with caring about something that means the world to you, whether it’s a cause, an art form, or something else that gives your life meaning.


Trying is more than half the battle. Even if you may not be the best-selling writer, President, or top activist that you want to be, you should be proud of yourself for continuing to put yourself out there no matter what. Most people quit after failing a few times, and you’ve made it clear that you’re determined not to let anyone stand in your way.

, If you noticed that the girl sitting across from you got a new haircut, compliment her on it! It will make her feel good, and in return, you'll feel good. Karma comes around, and if you're nice to people, they'll be nice to you back! Once you start complimenting people, you'll more than likely get a few compliments back, and other people will love you!

, Before getting other people to love you, you need to love them! You can't expect a person that you don't love and care about to love you back. You need to love each and every person (or at least care about them) before they can love you.

, Nobody wants to be around someone who's grouchy and mean all day! Stay positive and release good vibes! If you have had a bad day, learn to let go of those bad vibes, and don't let your mood affect the way you talk to other people. Nobody likes a grumpy person.

, Nobody likes a fake person. Don't change yourself to fit other people, and don't try to be a people pleaser either. Be fair and non judgmental of others. Embrace who you are, and different people around you. Whether you are talking to a popular person or that shy girl, treat everybody equally.

, As mentioned previously, you need to love yourself. Write down all the good qualities about yourself, and strive to correct those qualities you don't like. Learn how to be confident, as this is a crucial step in making other people love you. Embrace who you really are, even your flaws. Nobody's perfect, but as long as you love who you are, you don't need to be perfect!

Clean up your own messes.",How to Be a Sweetheart," No matter how strange or frustrating someone's actions may seem, everyone has his or her own set of circumstances. Take these circumstances into consideration and think about how things must seem from that person's perspective as a result.


For instance, if you're playing a game with someone who has never played it before, don't make fun of that person for having a hard time understanding the rules. The experience might be frustrating or embarrassing for that person, so it would be much kinder to help than to tease.
Similarly, if you accidentally bump into someone and that person yells at you for it, pause and tell yourself that he or she might have reasons for being irritable that you don't know about. Instead of yelling back, a better option would be to apologize and politely excuse yourself.;
, Ideally, you should try to approach life with an attitude of optimism and subtle confidence. People tend to react better to those who can appreciate themselves and the world around them.


It might sound cliché, but count your blessings when you feel tempted to dwell on the negative things going on in your life.
While self-confidence is a good trait to have, you should avoid seeming arrogant. A positive self-image is all about having good feelings for yourself. Arrogance means viewing your own self as being better or more important than those around you.
Be positive when people turn to you for encouragement, too. Instead of dwelling on everything that could go wrong, try to show that person how things could go right.

, There are times when your sweet, kind acts may go unrecognized. Learn to accept those occurrences without making a big fuss over being unnoticed.


It's natural to want credit for the good you do, but if you're doing good only for the sake of getting attention, you have the wrong sort of motive. Do good merely because it's the right thing to do.
Even this has its limits, though. Don't let others abuse or mistreat you. If you don't stand up for yourself, you might end up looking like a weakling instead of a strong sweetheart.

, When people are rude to you, look at their behavior as a reminder of what not to do. In doing so, you can reaffirm your own actions and stop yourself from reacting to the situation poorly.Acknowledge positive examples to follow, too. When you see someone do something sweet for another person, make a mental note of it and try to repeat a similar action later on.

, Speak and act with enthusiasm when you greet someone, regardless of whether that person is someone new or someone familiar.


Greet each person by name whenever possible. Even the most enthusiastic “Hey!” pales in comparison to “Hey, Jim!” or “Hey, Sally!”
Use phrases that express your enthusiasm. When greeting someone you already know, try something like, “It's great to see you again.” When greeting someone new, consider something like, “I'm so happy to meet you.”
Back up your words with nonverbal communication. Smiles are almost always a good idea. A warm hug is great when you're greeting someone you're close to, and a hearty handshake works well for less intimate acquaintances.

, Give the person you're speaking with plenty of opportunity to voice his or her own thoughts. It isn't enough to merely listen, though. You'll also need to respond and talk about your own ideas, as well.


It might be tempting to let the other person take complete control of the conversation, but doing so might actually work against you. By responding to the things others say and interjecting your own thoughts, you can demonstrate that you are fully engaged in the conversation and not distracted. Just make sure that you don't interrupt someone else as he or she is speaking.

, People enjoy compliments. When someone says something good about you, it probably boosts your self-esteem and sense of confidence. Complimenting someone else will do the same for him or her.


Compliments in general are important, but it's also important to maintain a certain degree of sincerity. Flattery that isn't genuine can easily sound sarcastic, and sarcasm almost never seems sweet.

, Trying to make small talk with someone relatively unfamiliar can be difficult, but the easiest way to leave a sweet impression is by latching onto a topic the other party enjoys that you enjoy, as well.Conversing about shared interests will keep both parties actively engaged, so both of you will walk away feeling more positive about the other person and the conversation as a whole.
This is easier to do with people you're already acquainted with since you may already know about a few connections you share. When dealing with someone relatively new, you'll have to look for cues that hint at such a connection. For example, if someone talks about the great dinner he or she cooked over the weekend, it might mean that he or she likes to cook. If you enjoy cooking, too, try asking if that's the case.

, The first thing that comes to mind isn't always the best thing to say. To avoid potential misunderstandings or difficulties, you should pause before saying whatever is on your mind. If you think it seems kind and appropriate after a few seconds of analysis, it should be safe to say.


As a general rule, you should avoid insensitive remarks or sharp, mean-spirited retorts. This can be difficult, especially if the other person is pushing your buttons, but keeping your cool will make you seem like a real sweetheart to any bystanders. The person trying to argue with you might appreciate it, too, after calming down, and you will probably even feel better about yourself for taking the high road instead of giving into the temptation to play dirty.

, Once you get to know someone, past experience with that person should help you anticipate his or her feelings, wants, and needs. Take some time to anticipate that person's response in a given situation and act in a way that takes his or her personality into account.


For example, if you know that working late tends to make your spouse grumpy, take that into consideration the next time he or she has to stay late at the office. Don't complain about the fact that your spouse is late and avoid bringing up tense topics of conversation (in other words, now is not the time to scold your spouse for his or her spending habits). Consider doing something nice and relaxing for your spouse, too, like cooking dinner or drawing a bath.

, In all situations, you should show the same sort of respect you would like to receive. This is true even when someone treats you disrespectfully.


Showing respect requires little effort beyond being civil. For instance, you might hold a door open for someone whose arms are full or hold your tongue instead of lashing out at someone who frustrates you.

, Don't play favorites, even if you really do favor one person over the other. Behaving justly in all circumstances will reduce the risk of creating hard feelings with people.When two or more opposing parties expect you to help mediate a disagreement, you should try to work toward a fair solution for all.
For instance, if you're going out to dinner with two friends and they disagree about where to eat, it might be fairest to side with the friend who picks the least often, even if his or her tastes don't match your own. If that friend's first choice specializes in a type of food your other friend is allergic to, however, you might also want to point that out and suggest that the chooser pick another restaurant.

, Helping others can be inconvenient. If you only help out when doing so is easy and convenient, though, you aren't doing much beyond what anyone might do. A sweetheart helps out even when it isn't necessarily pleasant or simple.


Be on the lookout for ways to help people who won't necessarily ask for help. This might mean giving up your seat to an elderly person when you're on a crowded bus or letting the person standing directly behind you in line cut in front when he or she has fewer items to buy.

, When interacting with people, you should do your best to smile at them. Laugh at their jokes and behave in a generally amiable manner.


Smiling and laughing sets people at ease and sends the message that you are a pleasant, friendly person to be with.
You need to pay attention to the mood, of course. If you're being introduced to someone at a funeral or other sad occasion, smiling and laughing could be perceived as insensitivity.

, Patience can be a hard skill to master, but the effort is usually worth it. People who are patient in situations that would usually evoke impatience are typically perceived as being sweet and good-natured.


When you feel a bout of impatience coming on, try to catch it and calm down as soon as possible. For instance, if you're standing in a long line at a fast food restaurant, you might grow irritated when you see the clerk make mistakes or the people in front of you order abnormally slow. Remind yourself that losing your temper won't make the line go faster. When it's your turn, greet the cashier with a smile and be polite as you place your order. If the wait really proves too stressful or inconvenient, silently leave and go elsewhere without making a fuss about it.

, Fix the messes you make, whether those messes are figurative or literal. People who don't take responsibility and expect others to clean up after them come across as being rude and uncaring. By contrast, taking responsibility for your own space and life can make you seem much sweeter.


In a literal sense, picking up after yourself means cleaning the spaces and tools you use. Throw your garbage away instead of leaving it lying around and wipe up your own spills instead of waiting for someone to do it for you.
In a figurative sense, this means solving your own problems instead of relying on someone else to do it for you. When you get into an argument with someone, take the initiative and apologize first. Talk things over with the people you disagree with instead of waiting for a third party to step in and do it for you.

, Take some time to think seriously about what is and isn’t okay for your partner to do.For example, you might be okay being the one to say “I love you” first, but may not think it’s okay for him to ignore your calls.

Talk to your partner about your relationship boundaries. Let him know where the line is before he crosses it.

Ask your partner if he would consider going to counseling to address your feelings that the relationship is one-sided and strategize about how to make things more balanced.


If your partner is not willing to put forth the effort, ask yourself if this is what you really want from a relationship and if it's healthy for your own wellbeing.

Be yourself.,
Tell the person.,
Don’t be a stalker.",How to Be Happy in One Sided Love2," Don’t try to change yourself to make someone love you.The person will see through it and be mad at you for lying to her.

Read her reaction.",How to Make Any Girl Want to Kiss You," What is chemistry? It is the term used to indicate that there is a spark, or attraction, between two people. Chemistry is important because it is what makes romantic relationships different from friendships. If you are interested in a girl, you'll want to build some chemistry so that you can move towards getting that first kiss.Don't worry if you don't immediately have chemistry. Some couples can build it over time. But if it hasn't developed after several dates, you might want to try moving things forward. You can do this by demonstrating more affection, or having a frank talk about how you feel the relationship is going.;
, Females actually respond chemically to men and how they behave. Girls will have a positive physical reaction when your behavior shows that you are good at bonding with other people. For example, let her see you interacting with your friends. At a party, laugh and tell jokes with your buds. Just make sure to do this naturally--don't look fake.You can also demonstrate bonding with your romantic interest. Try doing something nice, but simple, for her. When she enters the party, for instance, offer to grab her a drink.

, Doing something exhilarating causes your face to flush and your heart rate to spike--the same reactions a person has when feeling physically aroused. Take your girl on a date and do something that will get the adrenaline flowing. One idea is to see a scary movie. She will probably naturally lean in to you, or grab your hand during especially creepy scenes. This type of touching will open the door for a kiss later.You could also do something adventurous. If there is an amusement park nearby, take her out to ride a roller coaster. This will definitely get your hearts racing!

, Feeling pleasure increases the desire for affection. So try setting a cheerful tone on your date. Ask her about subjects that should be happy for her. For example, if she is planning to go on vacation sometime soon, ask her to tell you about her plans.Another idea is to ask her about her favorite restaurant neighborhood. Not only will she be talking about a pleasurable experience, but you'll also get some insight about her likes and dislikes. Bonus!

, Spending time together alone allows you both to get to know each other on a deeper level. Eliminate distractions including cell phones, unwanted visitors, or blaring music. Choose somewhere where you can get some privacy but also is comfortable. She may not be comfortable coming over to your house early in the relationship. You may not be comfortable kissing in public so make an informed choice about a good location for your kiss.Choose an activity that you can both do together like studying, hiking, or grabbing a bite to eat. Make sure you make it clear that it will just be the two of you so you can manage any expectations.
If you are walking or driving her home, the moment you say goodnight is often a great time to lean in for a kiss.

, In particular, you want to make sure that you two are either alone, or in a place where a kiss is appropriate. You do not want to scare her off by attempting a kiss in front of people who shouldn't be there. For example, if she is from a conservative family, it's probably not a good idea to try for a kiss in front of her parents.There are sometimes when a public kiss is both appropriate and natural. For example, if you are at a sporting event and your team wins the big game it would be perfectly natural to excitedly kiss your date.
The best idea is to go with your gut. If you feel a kiss would be inappropriate, don't go for it.

, Just like she probably doesn't want to be kissed in front of her family, she also doesn't want to be kissed at an awkward moment. Pay attention to her verbal cues and her body language to know when the time is right. If she is telling you a story about an important project at work, it is not the right moment. Instead, show that you are listening to her.If the conversation naturally slows and the two of you are making eye contact and smiling, this is a good moment for a kiss.

, Part of having the right timing is making sure that you are both open to kissing. You want your body to indicate that a kiss is your intention. There are many ways you can let her know you are interested.Face your body toward her. Smile and make eye contact to ensure a positive and open connection. Remember that you want to be genuine so don’t force a smile or eye contact or you’ll come across with an unnatural expression that she may find unattractive.
Keep your focus and convey your interest by nodding and reacting appropriately to the conversation.
Relax your arms and shoulders by doing what feels natural to you. Either keep them folded in front of you or keep them in your pockets. If you fidget when you get nervous, perhaps either of those choices will keep your hands busy.

, Some of us are naturally more accustomed to initiating physical touch. If you haven’t already established a pattern of physical contact, communicate your intentions by how you touch her. Touching her means that you not only have to physically get close to her but that you also want to get close to her on an emotional level. Touching her is a great way to flirt and should be done casually.Touch her as a reaction to a joke or get close to her without touching her by complimenting her perfume or her hair.Try touching her hand as you laugh at her joke. You could also gently pat or rub her shoulder while giving her a compliment.
Dancing is a great way to break the touch barrier. Even if it's a fast song, there are plenty of reasons that your hands or other body parts will touch while you're dancing.

, Once you have read the correct body language from her, proceed to caress her face by picking her chin up in the palm of your hand. If she has been returning your touch, allowing you to get close to her, and returning your verbal flirtations, you may proceed to touching her face.


Bring her face up towards you. She may get embarrassed and break eye contact. Be patient and playful as you continue to read her body language.If she doesn’t respond well to having her face touched, do not continue. Don’t make things awkward by trying to force a kiss.

, You don’t want to kiss her too hard, too fast, or too sloppily. While your first kiss may make a lasting impression, you also want to find out if you enjoy it as well. Don’t rush it. Instead, earn her trust by showing that you want to make her comfortable.Before initiating a kiss, look into her eyes and lean in close. Your intuition should tell you when the right moment is to proceed for a kiss.

, If you lunge in for a kiss unexpectedly, she may react unkindly and quickly move away. She may also make things awkward with laughter. Giving your date a moment to prepare not only builds the anticipation but also gives her time to compose herself., Is she smiling and blushing or is she bewildered and strained? If she reacts positively continue to flirt or compliment her and express your feelings. If she reacts negatively, just try to naturally move forward with the conversation. Don’t ramble or fidget.If she pulls away, respect her instincts. Give her time to search through her own emotions.If she smiles, kiss her again!

Practise kissing (both regular and French kissing).",How to Be a Hopeless Romantic," Be the quiet type of person. Don't speak unless you are asked to speak. Listen when others talk to you, but occasionally drift into a daydream (though you should still pay attention in school of course — dim-wittedness is hardly romantic). Think lots about your one true love. Be shy and imaginative — in a word, dreamy.


Remember to look up into the sky sometimes. When people ask what you're looking at (and they will) (especially if it's a clear day and there's nary a cloud in the sky) just smile dreamily and say ""Oh, nothing..."" and get back to sky gazing.

Also, it never hurts to quote Shakespeare (though as with quoting in general, it's classy to credit your source, so make sure you've actually read his plays, especially if someone hears you quoting the Bard and strikes up a conversation).


Say things such as ""Oh, how romantic"", ""Love conquers all"", ""Why hate? Choose love"", ""Don't be in despair. Love will always find a way"", and ""A kiss without a hug is like a flower without the fragrance"".
Always put your hands on your heart when you are thinking about something romantic or saying something romantic.

, They're not called Romance languages for nothing! (There's a bit of history behind that — look it up online if you're interested.) Some useful Italian expressions include: Ti amo (I love you), Romanticismo (romance), and Bello (beautiful). To find more, Google Translate is your friend.


As with any dictionary or online translator, be careful and check with a native speaker to make sure you're actually saying what you think you're saying.

, This helps you become more in love. You could try a classic form like a sonnet, or even a free verse poem (it doesn't even have to rhyme). Express yourself in art, poems, prose, writing... whatever works for you.

, Try taking photographs and placing them in your room. Look up to photographers like Ansel Adams, who only did black and white photos. (There are many black and white blogs on Tumblr whose owners might be able to point you in the right direction.) If you're not interested in photography, try a performing art like acting, dancing, or singing. You never know where it might take you.

, Be able to reference them in any situation. (And not just your own culture's tales — feel free to mix it up and add an appropriate reference to another culture's story.)

, Try to keep your TV shows intellectual but romantic and your movies should always be age-appropriate romances! Watch a lot of romantic movies (on your own time) and take features you like and apply them to yourself.


For TV look at The History Channel. Also, watch soap operas such as Coronation Street (Britain), The Young and the Restless (America), etc.
Some good movies are Titanic, When in Rome, and The Notebook. Watch romantic movies on a rainy day or a snowy afternoon when school is closed. Plus, look at old movies (think Turner Classic Movies) that feature such movie stars as Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant.

, It's natural and calming. Do not listen to hip-hop, rap, techno, etc, as these are more likely to stir you up rather than calm you down. Find some composers you like, or some classical radio stations, for example WETA (which you can listen to online).

, Wear mostly jeans, ballet flats, maxi skirts, shrugs, and maybe a flower in your hair sometimes. Accessories should be made of dogeared wood, especially bracelets. Wear a lot of pink, red, and white. They are the main colors of love.

, If you have braces, get then in pink or red or even both!

,, Also, do research online about kissing and how it all started.

, Keeping your body clean can do wonders for keeping your appearance neat. Taking a shower most days of the week can ward off body odor and make your appearance fresh and appealing.You don’t have to shower every day necessarily, but keeping dirt, oil, and sweat at bay can keep you smelling fresh.
Shower in warm water with a lightly scented soap or shower gel. Choose a scent that you like, but make sure it’s not too heavy so that others aren’t overwhelmed by the scent.
After you shower, moisturize your facial and body skin with a product formulated for your skin type. Moisturizer helps promote healthy, glowing skin, which studies have shown can be a powerful form of attraction to others.Make sure to put on antiperspirant and/ or deodorant to eliminate or keep body odor at bay. Body odor can quickly turn off someone to whom you want to appear irresistible.
If you participate in sports or other activities that cause you to sweat, consider showering after each time to ward off body odor that can develop from sweat.

, Oral hygiene is important to your overall health, but can also be important if you are talking to others frequently. Brushing and flossing regularly can not only maintain the health of your pearly whites, but also keep bad breath at bay, which could be a turn off for someone you are trying to attract.


Brush and floss your teeth at least twice a day, especially when you get up and before bed.
Brush and floss after meals if you can. Having food stuck in your teeth can be unattractive, but also promotes the growth of bacteria, which can cause bad breath that may make others not want to talk to you. If you don’t have a toothbrush, chew a piece of gum, which can help remove debris and bacteria.Remember that coffee, tea, wine, and tobacco can stain your teeth, which may detract from your irresistibility. If you consume any of these products, brush your teeth or chew gum afterward to minimize staining.

, Not only is maintaining a healthy weight important to your overall well-being, but it may help enhance your irresistibility. You will project an image of someone who takes care of her health, and it may also make you feel more confident, which is also irresistible. In addition, both diet and exercise can give you glowing skin, which also enhances your attractiveness.


Keeping your weight within a healthy range can be easy. Eating healthy, balanced, and regular meals promotes your overall health.
You should consume around 1,800-2,200 calories daily, depending on how active you are. Get calories from nutrient-dense whole foods including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy, and lean proteins, all of which can help maintain weight and help you glow from the inside out.Regular exercise will also help maintain your weight, promote your overall health, and help you glow from the inside out because it promotes blood flow. In addition, the object of your affection may also enjoy sports!

, Clothing can enhance anyone’s appearance and also be a point of departure for conversations. Wearing clothing and fashions that flatter your figure and personality can make you seem more irresistible to others.


You don’t have to buy expensive items to flatter your appearance. Purchase a few key well-made pieces and you can mix and match them.
Clothing is often mass-produced to fit a few different body types. Consider getting items tailored to fit your body, which can accentuate or highlight your features while concealing parts you may not like.
Accessories can also help pull together an outfit. A striking watch or belt are good options.
Avoid overdoing it with your appearance. Look like an slightly enhanced version yourself, not a superficial or idealized caricature of how you think you should look. For example, keep makeup and hair simple and neat.
Wear a nice, light perfume or cologne. Scent is closely tied to memory and if a person smells it or something similar, it may remind him of you and want to be around you more often.

, Most people enjoy being around others who are confident and comfortable in their own skin. Having confidence in yourself can make you all the more irresistible to any person you may want to attract.Avoid being arrogant or pretentious. This trait can detract from your irresistibility. Remain yourself: calm, cool, and collected.For example, if you’re an excellent photographer, you can say something like “I’m a really avid amateur photographer and have actually had some of my work displayed in exhibitions. Maybe I could show you some of my photographs sometime. I’d love to hear your opinion.” This not only projects your confidence, but also draws the other person into your conversation.

, Catching someone’s gaze and holding it is flirtatious and can help the person remember. Looking the person in the eye when you speak or even if you are not together in that moment can make you appear irresistible and draw her closer to you.


Avoid staring at the person if you are not together. Holding your gazes for a couple of seconds is sufficient.
When you are speaking with the object of your affection—be it romantic or just someone you want to know better—look them in the eye as long as you are together. This signals the person that you are completely engaged and interested in her and what she has to say.

, It’s important to listen closely to what others are saying. This not only helps show your interest, but also gives you the opportunity to later reference comments, which further enforces your interest. It may help you seem more irresistible to the other person.Meaningful conversations about mutual interests can help forge an important bond that may make you irresistible to the other person.Having common interests is a powerful way to cultivate attraction.Let the other person in on your hobbies and interests, too. This demonstrates your dynamism, which can help attract others to you., Not being independent or able to hold your own can make you less attractive to others. Demonstrating that you have opinions and don’t rely on others for your wellbeing can make you seem attractive and irresistible to almost anyone and help keep the interest going.Don’t dumb down yourself for anyone. Using your brain shows that you are independent and able to form opinions without being swayed by others. For example, if you hold a certain political belief, stick to your opinion and back it up with facts and details instead of quietly giving in to the other person.
Staying independent and not making yourself too available can establish intrigue and make you seem all the more irresistible.For example, don’t accept every offer to get together. Say you have something else going on at the suggested time and ask to reschedule. This makes you appear popular and may make another person want to be around you even more.

, Everyone enjoys being around someone who is positive and fun. Keeping things light and easygoing can help draw others to you and seem irresistible and effervescent.Although every person has an occasional bad day, try to not focus on this as much as possible. This can help reinforce your irresistibility and help maintain interest., Confident and friendly movements can attract people to you and make them want to stay in your general vicinity. Using positive body language can help to reinforce your irresistibility and make you feel good, too.Having good posture by standing and sitting tall projects confidence, as does a genuine smile.Looking relaxed and assured is attractive to others and can spur “copycat emotions” that further attract the person to you.Other positive actions that will make others feel that they can’t resist you are: steady eye contact, turning up your palms up, nodding, and pointing your feet towards the person with whom you are speaking., Talking and engaging with others verbally is an important part of any relationship. By working on your conversation skills, you may deepen and strengthen your relationship.Different ways you can cultivate your conversation skills include:


Realizing your personal strengths and what you have to offer. You can draw upon these if you feel uncomfortable in social settings.
Asking a trusted friend about what she thinks you can improve upon in conversation as well as what you do well.
Incorporating anecdotes about new and interesting experiences.
Staying positive and upbeat with your commentary.
Keeping your comments brief and to the point. Remember that no one enjoys listening to someone gloat about his accomplishments., Humor is something that both men and women find sexy and irresistible. By incorporating jokes or anecdotes into your conversations that are funny, you can attract any person to yourself.Don't force humor, which usually falls flat. Instead, try to see the humor in simple matters, and use those situations as a entry point for a joke or anecdote.Be as natural as possible. Having the confidence to let your humor shine through can help you be funny.
You can also cultivate your humorous side by:

Use your body language to express humor. Facial expressions, body positioning and movements, and tone of voice can all impact how funny you seem.Practicing telling jokes or humorous anecdotes. You can easily transform everyday situations into funny stories or jokes.Practice often so that your humor becomes more refined and second nature.
Situational humor may elicit more laughs than drawing upon canned jokes from other people.
Your humor will likely fall flat at some point. When this happens, use the situation to make another joke that can get the conversation started again.

Make him work for it.,
Let him know you’re happy that you know him.,
Set a casual time to hang out.,
Keep lip gloss on.,
Put yourself out there.,
Make him focus on you.,
Be playful.,
Compliment him.,
Pull him into the right setting.",How to Make a Guy Want to Kiss You," You’ve met an incredibly gorgeous guy; the last thing you want to do is over-inflate his ego right away. Don’t shower him with attention. Instead, show him that you refuse to be wowed easily. He’s probably used to the attention, so he’ll like that you seem slightly out of reach for him.Give him space so that he thinks it was him that made the choice to see you again.


Don’t gush over him. If he mentions doing something that sounds amazing, you can comment on it but don’t talk about how amazing it must’ve been for hours.;
, Leave it at that. While you guys are talking, just mention that you think he’s a cool guy and you’re happy that he’s in your life. Once again, don’t gush. All you’re doing is securing your spot in his mind. If you aren’t going to run into him, you can mention it during a texting conversation.

, Make sure he’s going to a party, or see if he wants to meet up after the home game. You don’t need to specify a time and place that it will be only you and him. You can meet him in a group setting and pull him aside during it.

, When you do run into him, you want your lips to be something that he notices. This is easily done by wearing lip gloss and occasionally licking your lips.

, It doesn’t matter how you sexy your outfit is, or how good your makeup looks, you need to make sure you don’t second guess yourself. Guys like it when you’re comfortable in your own skin. If you’re not confident about it, a guy can tell in a matter of minutes and be turned off., A great way to get noticed is by suggesting the two of you get away. Tell him you want to take him outside to show him something, or that you have pictures in you room for him to see. This will create time alone where he focuses on only you.


Have your lip gloss on for this time alone.

, Guys steer clear of girls who seem uptight. A playful attitude will show him that you have a sense of humor, and a guy is more likely to kiss a girl with a sense of humor. Laugh at him and lean in to touch his shoulder as you do. This will show him that you’re both playful and interested in him.


Lean into him while he’s talking. Simply sit next to him and lean your shoulders toward him to show him that you’re drawn to him.

, Use body and appearance-specific compliments to show him that you’re interested and that you notice him.”You look so handsome.”
”You weren’t kidding when you said you were working out. Look at you!”

, When you take him away from the crowds and take him to a private place to talk, it should set the mood. Not only does this keep his attention on you, but it makes him consider kissing you. It doesn’t have to be overly romantic—just somewhere that the two of you will be comfortable.

Mix things up.",How to Lip Lock," Lip locking is a simple yet intimate form of kissing, so you'll need to be close. Once the two of you are close enough to feel one another's breath, close your eyes.


At minimum, your face will need to be close to your partner's face. Before closing your eyes, make sure that your mouth is positioned just above your partner's mouth.
Even if you don't feel comfortable closing your eyes completely, you should at least narrow your eyes to slits once your faces are aligned.
Ideally, your entire body should be close to your partner. Regardless of whether you are standing, sitting, or lying down, you should lean your entire body toward your partner until you at least brush up against one another.;
, Close the remaining distance between you and your partner, bringing your lips together. Move your lips until you feel them seal around your partner's lower lip.


Your aim doesn't need to be perfect when you first touch lips. Slowly shifting your lips to the right position can be just as sensual as landing them there to begin with.
Only use your lips during this kiss. Do not open your mouth, use your teeth, or use your tongue. You can do these things later when leading into another type of kissing, but strictly speaking, they aren't part of a lip lock.

, Keep your lips locked onto your partner's for approximately 5 to 10 seconds.The exact amount of time isn't important, but this is meant to be a slow, sensual kiss, so don't rush through it. Take your time and hold the kiss for as long as the mood demands, even if that means holding it for as little as 3 seconds or as many as 20 seconds.

, Once it's time to break away, do so slowly and hesitantly instead of quickly backing off.


Don't make your partner think that you're in a rush to get away. You need to send the message that you'd rather not separate at all.
Slowly open your eyes as you back away. Look into your partner's eyes to determine if he or she wants to continue or would rather stop there.

, You can continue locking lips as many times as the moment demands. When the time comes to end it completely, simply gaze away from your partner while easing your face and body away, as well.


Additional lip locks should can be performed in the same way as the first, but you should also give your partner a chance to lock your lip in between his or hers.
Take time to breathe in between or during your lip locks, too.

, By keeping your lips moist and preventing them from chapping, you can make any kiss more enjoyable for both you and your partner.A little lip balm can make a big difference, and both guys and gals can use it without feeling self-conscious.
For severely dry, damaged lips, you may want to exfoliate. You can gently brush over your lips with a clean toothbrush, prepare a DIY lip scrub, or purchase an actual lip exfoliator.
For girls, adding a light layer of lipstick or lip gloss can also make your lips look plump, moist, and more kissable.

, Bad breath can ruin an otherwise good lip lock, so make sure your breath stays fresh when you lean in for that kiss.Brush your teeth two to three times a day.
It can also be a good idea to freshen your breath before meeting the person you plan to lock lips with. Consider using a little mouthwash or breath spray immediately before your date.
Peppermints and mint-flavored gum can help freshen your breath, too, but make sure that they're out of your mouth well before you plan to kiss. Holding them in your mouth can make the lip lock more awkward for both you and your partner.

, Eyes are conventionally viewed as ""windows to the soul,"" so making and maintaining meaningful eye contact can convey a deeper sense of passion during a lip lock.


Staring at your partner while your lips are locked can seem a little awkward, but peeking at your partner through hooded eyes in between kisses, before a kiss, or immediately after a kiss can create more intimacy.

, If your lips are the only things that touch during the lip lock, it won't seem like a very passionate kiss. You'll need to use your hands to show a stronger degree of desire.


Consider cupping your partner's face in between your hands as you draw in for the kiss. Doing so clearly lets your partner know your intentions while also making it easier for you to control the pressure of the kiss.
You can also let your hands roam during the kiss. Consider placing your hands on your partner's shoulders, around his or her waist, or on the back of your partner's head, using the leverage to pull your him or her closer.

, Your first lip lock should be light and gentle, but if the kissing continues past one or two, you might be able to apply a little more pressure.


Hard kisses can let your partner know how much you desire him or her, but the lip lock should still feel pleasant and not painful.
If you're locking lips for a while, consider varying the pressure back and forth between soft and hard. Doing so can keep things unpredictable and exciting.

, Once you feel comfortable with the basic lip lock, you can surprise your partner by locking lips without the standard build-up.


Instead of gradually easing into the kiss, grab your partner around the wait or neck and quickly bring your faces together, stopping just short of his or her lips. Quickly and firmly lock lips and break away after a few seconds. This is a passionate variation of the lip lock that is sometimes referred to as the ""flash bang"" kiss., As you become more experienced with different forms of kissing, switch between different types of kisses to keep things as passionate and exciting as possible.


You can ease into a different form of kissing by gently sucking or tugging on your partner's lip during an otherwise ordinary lip lock.Alternatively, you can move into completely different types of kiss after planting one or two lip locks. For instance, you might consider French kissing.

"
Ask your partner what they want from you.If you want to know what your partner expects from you, and how you can best protect them, be direct.,
Send your partner thoughtful messages throughout the day.Use text messages and emails to remind your partner that you care about and miss them.,
Touch your partner non-sexually.While sex is an important part of your physical relationship with your partner, it is only one part.,
Spend time with people who support your relationship.,
Take pride in your relationship.,
Encourage your partner to maintain their health.",How to Be a Protective Boyfriend1," Ask your partner, “Do you think I am protective of what we have together?” or “Do you think I am overprotective?”

Listen carefully to your partner’s answer. If you are confused or have follow-up questions, ask for more information when your partner has finished speaking.
If your partner expresses that you could be more protective and caring, take proactive steps to show that you care. For instance, if your partner indicates that you seem unconcerned when others flirt with them, explain why you react the way you do.
You could explain that you feel so confident in your relationship that you do not feel obligated to fend off other people who are flirtatious with your partner. Do not be defensive or passive-aggressive when explaining yourself. Explain your perspective in a calm, measured way and refer only to your own actions and beliefs.
For instance, do not respond to your partner’s expectation that you will be more protective by arguing that because he or she is not protective, you do not need to be either.
If your partner thinks you’re overprotective, take proactive steps to reduce your overprotective behaviors. For instance, if you scrutinize and over-analyze the messages she gets on social media, or designate which of her friends she can see, she might be concerned that you’re being overprotective. Adjust your behavior appropriately.;
, For instance, you might send a short message like, “Thinking of you,” or “Hope you’re having a great day.”


If you know your partner has a rough time ahead or is facing a serious challenge refer to it in your short, thoughtful message. For instance, if your partner has a test later, you could write, “Good luck on your test!”
Don’t overdo it. One or two brief, spontaneous messages a day is enough. More than that might be perceived of as clingy.

, Nonsexual touching can inspire feelings of affection and provide small opportunities for bonding. Showing you care is as important as saying you care.


When you wake up in the morning give your partner a big hug and a peck on the cheek.
If your partner is sitting or laying down watching TV, give them a squeeze on the shoulder as you pass by.
After your partner comes home from work, offer to give them a back rub to relieve the day’s tension.

, If a certain friend or family member is constantly pressuring you in overt or subtle ways to leave your partner, limit the time you spend with them. For instance, perhaps your mother makes sniping comments about your partner like, “She doesn’t have much of an education, does she?” You might have a friend who insists, “You could do much better.” You should respond to these situations by defending your partner. Tell the individual in question, “I’m in a loving and committed relationship. I wish that you could see how happy my partner makes me.” Explain to the friend or family member that you love and are committed to your partner. Encourage your partner to do the same.


Sometimes friends and family have serious concerns about our choice in romantic partners. Listen carefully to the issues your family and friends are concerned about regarding your partner. If many people have similar or overlapping concerns, you might be in a bad or abusive relationship.
Do not complain publicly about your partner. If you have issues with your partner, work them out one-on-one behind closed doors.

,

Go out in public with your partner. Instead of spending every night inside watching TV and eating dinner, go on dates. For instance, you could go to dinner in a nice restaurant and see a film together. You could go downtown and go shopping, or just enjoy walking around. Use your imagination to concoct a fun date you can do with your partner.

Celebrate your relationship on social media. Post happy pictures of you and your partner doing fun things together. Update your personal information to reflect the fact that you’re in a relationship.
Tell friends and family about fun things you and your partner did together. For instance, if your coworkers inquire as to what you’ve been up to, say, “My partner and I went to the park this weekend. It was great fun,” or “My partner and I had a barbecue in our backyard. We really enjoyed it.”

, Good health is the cornerstone of a good life. If your partner is not exercising enough -- or too much -- express your concerns in a loving way.


You could say, “I am concerned about your health. I want us to have a long, happy life together. Let’s work together to stay healthy.” Encourage your partner to get fit with an invitation such as, “Let’s go for a bike ride.” You might also say, “There’s a new gym nearby. Let’s check it out this weekend.”
Partners who work out together tend to improve the quality of their relationship.Take a walk after dinner or a bike ride at the park with your partner. Not only will be burning calories, but you’ll get to bond with your partner.
Besides working out regularly, eating right is an important component of good health. Go shopping with your partner so you can both buy things that you want to eat together. Choose healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Avoid processed, packaged foods loaded with salt, sugar, and fat.

Learn a martial art.,
Work out.,
Use caution when you’re with your partner.For instance, if you normally walk home from work through a rough part of town, avoid that stretch when walking home from work with your partner.,
Keep an eye out for potentially bad situations.,
Only use violence as a last resort.",How to Be a Protective Boyfriend2," There are many martial arts from many different countries. While no martial art will prepare you for every possible situation you could face, they will give you the training and muscle memory to adapt to bad situations, assess the severity of various threats, and react quickly.

If possible, train in multiple martial arts. The more self-defense knowledge you have, the better equipped you will be to protect your partner when the time comes.
If you can’t do martial arts, learn some basic self-defense techniques. Stomping an aggressor’s foot or kicking them in the groin before fleeing (with your partner) is a standard way to escape danger.

, While working out is a great way to stay healthy and fit, you can also build strength in order to keep your partner safe.

Focus on building upper body strength with sit-ups, chin-ups, push-ups, bench presses and dumbbell exercises. When the time comes for a confrontation, you’ll be ready.

Working out also impresses your partner. Healthy and fit people tend to be perceived as more attractive and likable.

, Go a few blocks out of your way to limit your exposure to potential crime or violence.


Wrap your arm around your partner whenever they seem concerned about people or places in the vicinity. This will reassure them that you’ll protect them. If someone is whistling or catcalling your partner, pull your partner close so that they feel stronger.

,

Imagine you and your partner are out on the town. You’re out with a group of friends. While you and your buddies are sitting comfortably in a booth, your partner goes out on the floor to dance with some friends. You notice a group of people near your partner who are getting rowdy, or somebody heckling her or him without any apparent reason. While you might be riled up and alarmed by this, don't step in straight away. Allow him or her the space to handle it but monitor the situation closely. Go to your partner’s defense if you feel it's needed.,

There are times when protecting the one you love mean resorting to violence. But most of the time, there are other options available. You should start by attempting to de-escalate any bad situation. For instance, if someone is speaking or acting aggressively toward your partner, intervene by apologizing. Tell the aggressor, “We’re sorry, it was just a mistake. We’ll be going now.” Then, make your exit.

Do not insult the aggressor or up the ante by threatening them. Challenging the aggressor will only make them more likely to hurt your partner, or you.
If the aggressor doesn’t let you leave or pursues you, call the police. Report the situation and follow their directions. Stay cognizant of the aggressor during the entire exchange, and watch for signs that they might strike. Defend yourself if necessary.
If an aggressor pulls a weapon on you, do not struggle with them or attempt to wrest it from their grasp. You could end up getting your partner or another bystander hurt.

Don’t be jealous.Remember, your partner is dating you.,
Gently but firmly dismiss individuals who approach your partner.,
Ward off persistent creeps and perverts.,
Enforce your partner's boundaries.",How to Be a Protective Boyfriend3," Just because they are getting attention from other people doesn’t mean they are reciprocating the advances.


Jealousy in small amounts is normal and demonstrates that you care about your partner.If your partner does choose someone else, take comfort in the fact that they are not the one for you. The right one for you, after all, is the one who stays committed to you. For that reason, again, there is no reason to be jealous.

, Politely go up to your partner and greet them. Ask them to introduce you to their “friend.” Your partner should reply something like, “He/She was just leaving.” At this point, hopefully, the would-be suitor realizes that your partner has a boyfriend and will cease their flirtation.


Depending on your partner's personality, they may be willing and able to shake off these people off themselves. If so, let them handle it, while keeping an eye on the situation in case the person refuses to listen to your partner.

, If your partner feels ogled or is getting unwanted attention, they will rightly feel very uncomfortable. Not only is it rude and invasive, but it can make your partner feel unsafe.


Tell your partner when you notice this happening and reassure them that you're aware of it and are prepared to say something if needed.
Stay alert for guys or girls who make pests of themselves. Call them out on their leering if needed, politely and firmly. For instance, tell them, “Leave her alone. She doesn’t deserve your leering.”
However, be careful to realize that if your partner is attractive, it's only natural for others to look, so learn to spot the difference between this curious and appreciative gazing and menacing leering.Don't go overboard if someone just throws an appreciative glance at your partner once and then goes on their way.

, Pay close attention to what your partner is and isn't okay with, and ask if need be. If someone is crossing your partner's boundaries, you are the backup. You can add weight to their words with a frown, glare, or a verbal reminder that ""She said no.""


You may need to do this with creeps, but also sometimes people you trust. For example, if a friend keeps pestering your partner to talk about something she doesn't want to, you can give a small frown and say ""She said she doesn't want to talk about it. Let it drop.""
Pay close attention to your partner's boundaries with you, too. If your partner says no to something, or they don't seem comfortable, listen to their wishes. No one should do things which your partner is uncomfortable with, including you."
"
Ask yourself why you’re getting overprotective.If your partner is not giving you enough attention, you might feel neglected.,
Admit your anxieties to your partner.For instance, you might feel worried that your partner is not attracted to you as much as they used to be.,
Confront your own lack of confidence.,
Respect your partner’s boundaries.",How to Be a Protective Boyfriend4," You will probably feel jealous that she is talking with others instead of you. In that case, express your concerns to your partner. Arrange a date night or special time when you can regularly be together one-on-one. This will ensure you both find enough time to spend together.


Try to compromise with your partner to find a comfortable amount of time you can be together each day.
If you were cheated on by your partner before, you might also become overprotective as a result. Perhaps you start trying to keep an eye on him/her. However, this is unhealthy, not to mention impossible. Rebuilding trust takes time, and overprotective behavior will slow the process.

, You might think your partner does not want you around anymore. If you feel these things, express them to your partner. Often, being reassured that your partner is still interested in you can alleviate your stress and reduce your need to be overprotective of him or her.

,

Low self-esteem and a lack of self-confidence can lead to unhealthy attachments and overprotective behavior. Build your self-confidence each day by taking care of your appearance. Dress well and maintain good hygiene. Eat a balanced diet and get 60-90 minutes of exercise each day. In time, you will feel more comfortable with yourself and not need to be so overprotective of your partner.

Make three lists: one of your strengths, one of your achievements, and one of things you admire about yourself. Consult your partner and other friends about what they think belongs on each list. Refer to it regularly when feel down about yourself.
If you suffer from long-term insecurity about your personal prospects, consult a psychologist. Psychologists are trained to help you work through personal problems and identify causes which may lie deep in your past.

, For instance, do not snoop into their text messages or emails. If you are suspicious that your partner is cheating on you, confront them with your concerns directly. Don’t go behind your partner’s back to discover what they’re saying to their friends or coworkers.If they ask for alone time or don’t want to go out every time you offer them an invitation, don’t take it personally. Everyone needs alone time.

If he keeps finding ways to get closer to you, you should feel comfortable kissing him., Don't just listen for compliments, though. Listen to the way he's talking to you. If his voice gets softer, and he starts whispering things to you, he's ready for a kiss.

Whispering also requires him to move in closer to you, making it easier to kiss.Speaking in a softer tone is an especially good sign if the two of you are in public. He's trying to get your attention and hold it, to make you feel like you two are the only people in the room., If he starts to get quiet, or there are more pauses in the conversation, he may not be losing interest. If he's maintaining eye contact, even if he's quiet, he's still trying to tell you something.

, All guys flirt in different ways, but a few things you can count on are touching and joking. If he's stroking your arm, or your lower back, he's trying to tell you he's into you. The same goes if he's laughing at your jokes, or making his own.

Pay close attention to how she engages you during conversation.,
Pay attention to her level of enthusiasm during the conversation.,
Note how she holds up her end of the conversation.,
Read her posture.,
Gauge how she reacts to your touch.,
Ask.,
Move in closer.,
Send the right signals.,
Lean in for the kiss.,
React calmly.",How to Know if a Girl Wants to Kiss," There’s no single sign that someone wants to be kissed, but you can pay close attention to how she engages and interacts with you to get insight into whether she might welcome your affection.


Does she hold eye contact? If she looks directly into your eyes and maintains solid eye contact, it’s a sign that, at the very least, she’s engaged with you in the conversation. Notice as well if her eyes seem to get large while looking at you. Often when people like what they see, their pupils will dilate and their eyes will widen slightly.
Does she smile and laugh? If she sincerely smiles and laughs at appropriate times during the conversation, it will tell you she’s enjoying the conversation. That in and of itself isn’t a reason to immediately go in for a kiss, but it’s a good sign.
Does she keep glancing at your lips? If so, it may be a sign she’s thinking about kissing. But take it in context, though, because she may also just be in the habit of glancing at someone’s mouth when they talk.;
, If you pay attention, it’s often relatively easy to pick up on her feelings about the relationship between you.


If she seems bored or anxious to get through the date, it’s most often a pretty clear sign she’s not going to feel ready for a kiss.
If she’s enthusiastic during the date and suggests you go somewhere else to prolong the date--to get coffee, go for a walk, etc.--it’s a good sign that she’s enjoying the date and may be open to a goodnight kiss.

, You can often tell quite a bit about how the other person is feeling about the date simply by what they talk about.


If she’s actively involved in the conversation and asks questions that are aimed at getting to know you better, it’s a signal that she’s interested in you and may be developing some affection.
If she talks mostly about herself, dismisses your comments, or sits in stony silence, take that as a pretty clear cue she isn’t very interested.
If the conversation turns toward increasingly intimate subjects, it’s often a sign you’re both comfortable and perhaps also attracted to each other.

, Note how she holds her body when you’re together.If she turns her body towards you (shoulders, chest, and legs or feet), leans forward, and keeps her arms open rather than crossed, those are all positive body language cues.
An open posture, while a good sign, needs to be taken in context as part of a series of positive cues. A woman may have open and engaged body posture, but may be feeling more friendly than amorous.
If she gets close enough to touch and/or frequently leans into your personal space, that’s often a strong indicator of interest--just be sure she isn’t leaning in simply because it’s hard to hear you.

, Pay close attention to how she reacts when you lightly touch her arm or her hand.If she stiffens or pulls away, that’s a sign she’s not yet comfortable, and going in for a kiss now probably won’t go well.
If she blushes, giggles, or smiles, those are signs she’s comfortable with you and would possibly be receptive to a kiss.
If she lingers or presses against you while you’re saying your goodbyes, it’s often a sign that she’s reciprocating your affection.

, If you can’t determine from her actions and body language how she’s feeling, you can just ask.Asking her permission before assuming she wants to kiss can be a sign of consideration on your part, and either way you’ll find out where you stand.

, If her body language and engagement in the conversation are all encouraging, you can begin moving in closer and preparing to attempt a kiss.If you give off the right signals, she could very well take note and reciprocate so that the kiss happens naturally and doesn’t feel awkward or unexpected.
The first thing to do when trying to engage in a kiss is to move closer. If you’re sitting, sit so that part of your leg touches hers.
If you’re standing, stand close to her and take or touch her hand.
If she moves back when you try to move in closer or pulls away from your touch, it’s a pretty clear sign that she doesn’t want to get affectionate.

, Up until now you’ve been focused on her body language, but now it’s time to give her a chance to read yours.Hold meaningful eye contact and move your gaze from her left eye to her right eye to her mouth and back, pausing for just a moment on each. Most people can read that as a clear sign of the desire for a kiss.
Slow things down. Slowing down the moment and the conversation can clear the way for an affectionate moment between you if she’s interested. So if you’re walking, slow down the pace. Let the conversation slow down but keep up meaningful closeness and eye contact.
If she doesn’t return the same level of eye contact or seems to want to put distance between you, it probably means she read the signals you’re sending and is now sending signals of her own that she doesn’t want to be kissed.

, If at this point she’s responding positively to your body language and signals, you can go for a kiss.Move in even closer and part your lips slightly, looking from her mouth to her eyes.
If she reciprocates, looking into your eyes and gazing back and forth between them and your mouth, go for it and kiss her.
If she looks awkward, tries to move away, or tries to divert the conversation to something safer, recognize that she isn’t ready and let it go.

, Whether you have a successful kiss or not, react with calm and equanimity.


If the kiss is successful, look her in the eyes, smile, and continue what the two of you were doing. Don’t gush or get wild and starry-eyed--you may come across as immature or too eager, both of which can be turn-offs.
If the kiss isn’t successful, don’t panic or freak out. Most especially, don’t get angry or hostile. Either brush it off and go about what you were doing before or smile slightly and apologize.

Kiss.",How to Lean in for a Kiss1," This is a really sweet and romantic gesture that will let them know you are leaning in for a kiss. You don’t have to do this step, but it might give you that little extra courage to go in for the kiss. Put your hand on their jaw or push their hair behind their ear. You can even softly angle their face towards yours., If they lean in with you, they want to kiss just as badly as you do. When you touch them and get closer, make sure they seem genuinely interested and happy about these advances. Look to see if they’re glancing at your lips. Finally, see if they’re licking their own lips, as if to prep them for a smooch. Use your common sense to make sure that you have permission to go ahead!, In other words, lean down if your partner is shorter than you, or lift your head upwards if they're taller. If they're much taller, you may even need to get on your tip toes! It can be intimidating to kiss someone who is much shorter or taller than yourself, but it's very manageable. The important thing is to ""meet halfway,"" so make sure you angle yourself so that you're closer to their height.


If you're still nervous about a big height difference, Google ""Shaquille O'Neal and Nicole Alexander kiss."" If the 7'1"" basketball star and his 5'2"" girlfriend can kiss, you won't have a problem., One of the biggest concerns when it comes to leaning in for a kiss is bumping noses. To avoid this, you need to make sure your face and your partner's face are cocked in opposite directions. You don't need to bend your neck at a ninety degree angle– keep it natural. If their head is already leaning to one side, casually tilt your head to the opposite side. If they are looking straight at you, with no tilt, choose a side, tilt your head, and they will take their cue from you.

, Despite calling tightly pursed lips the ""kissy face"" in photos, this is not how you should actually kiss. Close your lips, but keep them relaxed. If you form your mouth into a tight pout, you'll look like a cartoon fish coming in for a kiss, and that won't entice your crush. Keep your lips relaxed until they're almost touching your partner's, and then you can slightly purse them. Just try to keep them feeling soft and gentle.


It may sound silly, but practice kissing the back of your hand. Practice kissing gently, avoiding a tight pucker.

, Once you’re close to their face, it’s time to shut your eyes and go for it.Keeping your eyes wide open is a rookie mistake. As soon as you know where your mouth is going, shut your eyes. Don’t close them prematurely, or you could end up kissing their chin or their nose.

, Whether it’s a quick peck or a long, movie-quality make-out, you’ve successfully leaned in for a kiss. Congratulations! Once you’ve had that initial kiss, you will probably feel more comfortable reading their signals and leaning in for a kiss in the future.

As you get closer to them, start speaking more softly and more slowly. The idea is to make the situation feel more intimate. By getting closer and talking more quietly, they’ll know that you only have eyes on them., Initiate some sort of physical touch, whether it’s romantic or not. Hold their hand, rest your arm or leg against theirs, or even just find an excuse to touch their shoulder or back. Once you’ve had that first physical contact, you’ll become more comfortable. Think about big kissing scenes in movies: the two actors are typically touching in someway before the kiss occurs. Bridge the gap, and find a way to touch the person you want to kiss.If they react well to your touch, that’s a great sign. Obviously, if they pull away or look uncomfortable, respect that. That’s a great way to know they aren’t ready to kiss, without getting rejected in a bigger way.

, This will let them know you’re thinking about kissing them, and that you want to be kissed. Don’t stare like laser beams, without blinking or glancing into their eyes. Just continuously glance down at their mouth as you touch, get closer, and continue talking.They should get the idea.

Be obvious, if you need to.",How to Lean in for a Kiss3," It’ll be easier to lean in for that kiss if you’re somewhere secluded and quiet. You don’t have to be the only people there, but you shouldn’t be in a large crowd of friends. Go somewhere where you can chat, and there is a more intimate vibe. Even if you’re at a party, try to go somewhere quiet where you can feel alone., Make sure your lips are not chapped or cracked– that can be a major kissing turn-off. Keep your breath fresh, by brushing regularly and bringing mints or gum with you.If you’re a lady, you may want to avoid the bold, thick lipsticks. These can intimidate a male who isn’t sure what will happen to that make-up if he goes in for a kiss., If you’ve been eager to kiss your crush for awhile and it’s just not happening, despite following all of these tips, you may need to just throw “hints” out the window. If you really want a kiss, and you know your partner is interested too, say it! They might be shy, but at least it’ll get your intentions out there and you can figure out if it’s going to happen or not.

, Generally, if you're going to kiss someone on a date, you'll want to do it at the end. This advice is particularly important if you are on a first date.

Most likely, the person will lean in towards you, too. If the person doesn't want the same thing, they'll likely lean back., Consent is important, even when you're trying to kiss someone. Consent just means you have the person's permission to do something like kiss, hold hands, or something even more intimate. Asking if you can kiss someone doesn't need to break the moment.

Pay attention to her nose.",How to Know if Your Girlfriend Is Ready to Kiss You1," You should be able to tell a lot about your girlfriend's desire to kiss you from her eyes. They don't say the eyes are the windows to the soul for nothing.


If she looks you directly in the eye, she is probably establishing intimacy and is at least open to kissing you. Although eye contact is almost always a positive sign, remember that sometimes people look down or away because they are shy or nervous. Still, if she is not looking at you, that's a warning sign that she's not open to a kiss.Women will give you more submissive looks in some cases when they want to be kissed, such putting the chin down and subtly looking down.
Slightly narrowing the eyes is a pose that many women go into when they are waiting for a kiss.
Are her pupils dilated and are her eyes widening? If so, these are signs that she is enjoying being around you, so she is probably open to a kiss.;
, Women prepare their lips for a kiss. So if you want to know if she wants to kiss you, zero in on her mouth.


Is she biting her lip or licking her lips? These could be signs that she is trying to moisten them for a kiss.
If she is pursing her lips or they look hardened, this is a bad sign. She is closing herself off to you. If she's applied lip gloss recently, or freshened her breath, this could mean she wants her lips to look desirable to you, in the hopes you will kiss them. This is especially true if you can tell she's reapplied them (say when you went to the bathroom). If she's looking at YOUR lips, it probably means she is thinking about kissing them.

, This might sound odd, but research has shown the nose can give away signals of desire - often without her realizing it.


If her nostrils are flaring slightly, she probably wants a kiss. Physically, flaring the nostrils means she is taking in more air because she is preparing for physical activity. You need to take this one in context. If she's in the middle of an argument with you, the physical activity her body is preparing her for might not be in your favor.

, If it's the end of the day, and you both are about to go your separate ways, then now is your chance, give him a hug and hold it for about 5 seconds, then pull back a bit, but don't move your arms.

, Forget about being nervous. Think about this going great, because if you do this step properly, kissing will be the easiest thing in the world. Look into his eyes, tilt your head just a bit to avoid colliding, and lean in and gently close your eyes, and kiss him.

, Hold the kiss for about 10 seconds, keeping your eyes closed, after about 10 seconds, pull away, smile at him, and be happy for the rest of the day.

If your girlfriend doesn't like to put that on display, you need to respect that.


Have a conversation with your girlfriend about public displays of affection (PDA), preferably before you are out in public. You could start off with something like, ""I really like showing affection towards you in public. How do you feel about me kissing you when we're out and about?""
If she's not okay with it, don't try to coerce her to kiss you while in public.;
, At least, don't make it a first kiss without talking about it first. It could be awkward if she isn't as into you as you think, plus you could make her feel uncomfortable in public.While you might think it's a grand romantic gesture, it could have the effect of turning her away from you if she's uncomfortable.

, In professional situations, you want to keep the PDA to a minimum, as many people do not consider it to be appropriate. If you're picking your girlfriend up from work, for instance, you probably don't want to French kiss her in the middle of the office.You can probably get away with a peck on the cheek or forehead.
It's especially important to skip PDA at the office if you work with your girlfriend. Most workplaces frown on inter-office romances.

, That is, don't pick a place like a bus where people have no choice but to stay in the vicinity and watch you kiss. It will make them uncomfortable, and it may make your girlfriend uncomfortable.Other places to skip include the elevator (if there are other people there), a cab, or the subway.Also skip places where you're near a person who has to stay where they are, such as a security guard., While many people are becoming more accepting of same sex relationships, you should consider where you are when kissing if you are in one of these relationships. The same can be said of mixed-race and other relationships. Of course, you shouldn't hide who you are, but if you are in a especially conservative community or business, kissing could actually be a safety risk.Think about where you are and if it is a safe place to be kissing. For instance, is the area too isolated, meaning you couldn't get help if you need it?
Think about the atmosphere of the city or business you're in. Is it a deeply conservative one, where you might have trouble exhibiting PDA with a person who is the same sex or of another race?
On a positive note, with the passage of laws across the U.S., hate crimes have decreased over time., When kissing someone in public, keep it fairly chaste. That is, don't have a full-on making out session. Keep it to a few seconds, and mostly skip the tongue and petting.One person put it this way: Pretend your grandmother is standing right next to you. If you wouldn't do it in front of her, don't do it in public.In addition, keeping it light helps you not cross any legal boundaries. The laws on how much is too much varies by city and state, but if you keep it to light kissing, holding hands, and hugging, you should be fine., You can let your partner know that the idea of kissing is on your mind with some non-verbal communication. Gently touching her as you talk, such as touching her arm, can be an indication. Another way to flirt is to let your eyes drift to her lips on occasion to indicate where your mind is.Notice her eyes, too. For instance, is she making eye contact with you? That could be a sign she's interested in you and wanting to kiss.
Also, watch to see if she's looking at your lips as much as you're looking at hers, a sign she may want to kiss.

, Most people maintain a distance of about four feet. That's the ""bubble"" you keep around you that's considered personal space. If she comes in closer, particularly if she comes in closer than a foot and half, she's entering your intimate space, a sign she's interested in you.You can also enter her intimate space by getting closer to her. However, if she steps back to create distance, that's a sign you need to respect her distance and that she may not want to be kissed.

, While you may be able to tell if she's overtly flirting with you, you may be less aware when her body language is telling you to slow down. For instance, very tense body posture is a sign she's not comfortable with how the interaction is going.Look for tense shoulders and crossed arms, for instance.
Another sign she may not be interested is she's pointing her body away from you rather than towards you.
However, a good sign in posture is if she starts mirroring your stance or body language, something we do unconsciously with people we like., You may think it's more romantic to just kiss her, but it's important to get consent first. All you have to do is ask her if it's okay and get an enthusiastic ""yes!""For instance, you could say, ""I'd really like to kiss you right now. Is that okay?""
You could also say, ""How would you feel if I gave you a big ol' smooch right now?""
Respect her decision if she says ""no."" Don't try to pressure her into it.

, When asking your girlfriend for consent, you need to get an answer. If she doesn't give one at all, that is not consent.However, nonverbal cues can be consent. Nodding or her kissing you would be a sign of consent.Nonetheless, if her nonverbal cues aren't showing an enthusiastic ""yes,"" wait until you get one.The fact that she doesn't resist isn't consent, either., No one likes to kiss an ash tray or a mouth full of onion and garlic flavor. Pop a breath mint in before you go in to kiss her.It also wouldn't hurt to do a quick check-up in a mirror first, if possible, to make sure you don't have anything in your teeth.
If no mirror is available, run your tongue around your teeth to make sure they're clean.

, Rough lips are a turn off. If your lips are all cracked and gross, she's probably not going to want to kiss you. Try using lip balm regularly, and don't be afraid to put a bit on leading up to the kiss.You can discreetly put some lip gloss on by going to the bathroom or by looking away for a moment.
Don't put too much on, as you don't want to create an oil slick for kissing.

, Try to pick a romantic spot. For instance, in a park by a river is nice, much better than, say, the back alley behind a restaurant. Also, try to choose a place where there aren't too many people around.If people are milling around, it can kill the romance.
Try to pick a place she feels comfortable. If she's not comfortable, the kiss won't be enjoyable for her.

, If you haven't quite got up the nerve, even though you've asked, you can stall a bit by touching her face. You can also gentle tilt her head towards you so you can kiss her more easily.Always be looking for signs of nonverbal communication. For instance, if you reach out to touch her and she pulls away, you should stop.

, Once you've stopped and picked the perfect spot plus got her consent, it's time to go in for the kiss. Lean in closer, puckering lips a bit as you go. You want to make sure they have some definition to them for kissing, so your girlfriend has something to kiss.If she pulls away, let her.
When you're ready, pull back again.

, If this relationship is still new, you may be a little nervous. If you are, don't worry, the hard part is over. Just relax and enjoy the kiss.Focus on enjoying the moment.
Try not to think about whether you're doing it right or what's going to happen in a few minutes.

, This tip is to help you out, not because of who's standing around. That is, a little tongue is okay, but no one likes to be attacked by a tongue like a dog. Keep it tasteful.For instance, you can try lightly licking across her lips, but try not to lap her whole face.

This will create an opportunity to flirt.For example, if you’re both going to be taking Chemistry together, try sitting close to them so you can ask questions.;
, After you’ve been getting along in settings where you both have to be somewhere, you should invite your crush to do something fun in a group.


Group activities, such as having lunch out or playing softball, are great because your crush can get to know you without the pressure of a date. Try to pick an activity that fosters conversation. Pick a game night instead of a movie, for example, so you can talk to each other more.For example, you could say, “My friends and I are trying a new BBQ place downtown this weekend for lunch. Do you want to come?” Be sure to mention that you are going in a group.
After one successful group hang out, your goal should be to schedule more. Try to integrate your crush into a social aspect of your life. This way when kiss them out of the blue it feels more like the exciting culmination of building anticipation rather than a rude surprise. Be patient. This process can take time.

, After a few successful group hang outs, ask your crush to hang out one-on-one. It’s not necessary to define this as a date. The goal is for your crush to enjoy spending time with just you, so they can begin to consider you in a romantic way, setting up your surprise kiss.For example, to ask your crush out, you could say, “It’s supposed to be a nice day Saturday. Want to go play putt putt golf with me?” or “I’ve been meaning to try that new Café on Green street. Want to grab a bite on Thursday?”
Try to avoid something overtly date-oriented like dinner and a movie, which will create expectations around your kiss. A competitive activity can be fun and will keep your crush guessing.
If your crush rejects your offer to hang out one-on-one or seems unreceptive, understand that not all crushes are requited. You probably should not try to kiss them if they feel uncomfortable hanging out just you two together.

, Your crush’s body language can tell you a lot about how they are feeling when you are together. More open postures like legs set wider and hands on hips indicate comfort. More closed postures, knees crossed or arms crossed over their chest indicate unease.Try to read your crush’s body language to gauge their physical comfort with you. This can help you read if a moment for an unexpected kiss is right.

, If your crush’s body language tells you they are feeling comfortable with you, try some physical contact, like brushing their arm or even holding hands. This can help you feel out if a kiss they aren’t anticipating will go over well or not.

, If you’re afraid your kiss out of the blue may be rejected by your crush, try kissing them on the cheek. If they are comfortable with that, they could be receptive to more intimate kissing from you.

, At the end of a one-on-one outing, linger with your crush just a little longer than normal. Attempt to draw out natural pauses in your speech. Even if you’re nervous, try not to fill every moment with words. This allows a natural moment of anticipation to build.Creating more anticipation for the kiss will make it seem more exciting and out of the blue.

, If you want to make yourself as kissable as possible, be sure your breath is fresh and that you don’t have any body odor. It’s also helpful to apply an unflavored lip balm for soft lips.Brush your teeth twice a day (especially your tongue) and floss regularly to keep your mouth ready for kissing.
Always wear deodorant. It’s especially important if you find you get nervous and sweat a lot around your crush.

, This will signal that you’re hoping for a more intimate moment without being too obvious, enhancing the element of surprise.


If you’re walking your crush to their door, for example, don’t trail far behind. Walk with them. If there are steps, you can even level a height difference between you by stopping a stair above or below where they do.

, Now that you’ve created a moment of physical closeness, it’s time to bridge any emotional distance. Say something sweet and surprising to make them feel close to you. It’s important that you believe the thing you say here, as the emotion behind your sentiment will be obvious.For example, making eye contact, you could say, “I felt really attracted to you today.”

, Don’t say anything after your sincere surprise comment. Simply draw out the moment. Shoot a brief glance at their lips, not longer than two seconds, and then make eye contact with them.Try to keep your mouth gently parted, receptive to a kiss, during this look.
If they look at your lips too, that is a great sign.

, If your crush feels the same way, they will meet your kiss. If they turn away, don’t force them to kiss. Respect them and understand that they may not share your feelings.If you’re feeling unsure about whether your crush will be receptive, lean in for the kiss very slowly. This gives your crush time to stop the kiss if they do not want it or realize that, however unexpected, you want to kiss them.

Wait at least two weeks before you begin the serious kissing.,
Start the close-lipped kisses.,
Take things slow.,
Press your lips gently against your partner's.,
Keep your tongues away from the braces.,
Don't be afraid to go for it.,
Avoid eating cumbersome foods right before you kiss.,
Do not make fun of a person with braces.,
Consider taking additional steps to keep things sexy.",How to Kiss With Braces," When you or the person you want to kiss first get braces, you shouldn't rush to start making out the second you walk out of the dentist's office. Your braces will hurt at first, and you'll need some time to get comfortable to the metal in your mouth, and to learn how to manage your braces when you eat, brush your teeth, and complete any other tasks that are made more difficult by your braces.


You can still kiss your special someone on the lips in the meantime, but don't take it further than that.;
, Hastily introducing teeth to metal is not a good way to get things started. Though you may be longing for some French kissing, you should take things slow and kiss only using your lips at first -- you can work your way up to French kissing as you get more comfortable. In the meantime, you can even take care to soften your lips with gloss an hour or two the pecks on the lips begin so you feel more comfortable.

, This is especially true if this is your first time. Start off very gently so you can get a feel for the terrain. As you get more practice, you'll learn where and when to apply pressure (soft at first), and where to avoid it. As you kiss your partner, explore his or her closed lips and see how comfortable you feel before you make the next move. And if you don't even feel comfortable enough to kiss yet, then take a step back.

, If you do this too hard and fast, you may hurt the other person, which will force your teeth and gums against your lips -- you could end up hurting yourself, too. Once you're comfortable with these kisses, start kissing your partner more passionately while still only using your lips. You can still generate plenty of passion without going for the full-on tongue kiss.


If you're the only one in the duo with braces, you might want to warn your partner about this.

, Whether you're wearing braces or your partner is, you should part your lips widely enough and open your mouths enough that your tongue moves between your partner's teeth and doesn't get stuck on the braces. If you run up against the braces, you can end up cutting your lips or gums, and your partner can hurt his tongue if it brushes up against your braces.

, Sure, you should go slowly at first, but that can build anticipation, and make the kissing even more exciting. So, once your tongue is comfortably between your partner's teeth and both of your tongues are positioned away from your braces, then you should be comfortable with exploring your partner's mouth. Move your tongue in circles, or just gently move it up and down and enjoy the sensation.


Don't worry about your braces getting stuck together, either. That is an absolute myth! Braces are not magnetic.

, Though you don't want to be too paranoid about having a perfect situation inside your mouth before you kiss or you'll miss out on the romance of spontaneous kissing, you should be mindful before you make a move. Though you shouldn't fast right before you kiss, you should be aware of which foods are braces-friendly and which should be avoided at all costs. Any foods that melt in your mouth and that are easy to chew and swallow are okay, as a rule; any foods that are crunchy take forever to chew, or just stick around, like mango, should be avoided.


If you're at the movies and know you'll be kissing, go for the melt-in-your-mouth chocolate instead of the popcorn, which can easily get caught in your teeth -- and therefore, your braces.

, If you're on this page because your kissing partner has recently been given the gift of braces, then you should be extremely sensitive to his or her situation. Don't make any ""brace face"" or ""metal mouth"" jokes unless you want an embargo on kissing all together. Your partner is likely very sensitive and feels self conscious enough as it is; it's your job to make him or her feel better, not worse.


If you both have braces, then great! You can laugh about it together.

, If you've been kissing with braces for a while but it's just not working, or there are just too many rough edges in the metal to make room for romance, then you may have to take some additional measures. You can consider covering the rough spots with dental wax or silicone, or even smooth them out at the dentist if they're really rough, but only try this if it makes you comfortable.

Watch her posture.,
Study her hands.,
Wait for her touches.,
Spot whether she has open body language.",How to Know if Your Girlfriend Is Ready to Kiss You2," Posture can be very revealing. Much of communication is made up of non-verbal cues. Sometimes people don't even realize they are communicating this way.


If she is learning into you or toward you, even slightly, it probably means she is more open to a kiss.
On the other hand, if she is leaning away, that's a bad sign. You should also pay attention to the direction her feet are pointing. If they are pointing away from you, it could be a sign she is looking for a chance to leave.
Does she move away when you move slightly toward her? This is a test you can use to measure her body language interest in kissing you. Subtly create more of a zone of intimacy and see if she complies or moves away to diminish it. , Women will use their hands to touch things or show femininity if they want you to kiss them. If a woman plays with her necklace, she's probably into you. But you should take this act in context. If she also has other body language that is open to you, that's a better sign because sometimes a woman is just nervous.
If a woman is playing with or twirling her hair, it's a sign she wants you to find her attractive and is flirting with you.
If she touches something else, like a glass (running her fingers over it), in even a somewhat sensual way, that's a good sign. , If she has touched you recently, even in small ways, this could be her way of creating more intimacy in the hopes you will kiss her.


Even the slightest of touches show desire. That means it's a good sign if she brushes her hand against your knee or arm.
Touch probably means she wants to get closer to you. It's an even better sign if she touches your face.
If she softly, playfully hits you on the arm, she is trying to create a playful vibe with you, which is a way that women flirt. You could test her out by touching her slightly first to see how she responds. For example, brush your feet against hers under the table and see what she does. Another technique is to touch a piece of jewelry she has lightly (earrings, necklace), and say you admire it. If she smiles and is OK with you moving closer into her space, that's a good sign., When taken together, is her body language closed or is it open? If she has open body language, she is not trying to erect barriers between you.


Signs of open body language include arms at the side, body tilted toward you or facing you, eye contact, feet pointed toward you.
Signs of closed body language include arms crossed over chest, feet or legs crossed, feet pointing away from you, body tilted away from you, and minimal eye contact.
How much personal space is she leaving between you? If it's not much, she's already open to an intimate connection with you on some level. This is a good sign for you.

"
"
Consider how she talks to you.,
Try the triangular kissing technique.,
Spot the window of opportunity.,
Handle her moving away.",How to Know if Your Girlfriend Is Ready to Kiss You3," Does she seem like she wants to keep the conversation going? It's a good sign for you if she does.


Is she asking you a lot of questions? Are they deep and personal? If the answers are yes, she probably wants a more intimate connection with you.
Are you making her laugh? Laughing at your jokes (especially if they are not very funny) is a way that women flirt.
Is she trying to keep the conversation going by being the one to ask questions or lead or direct the conversation? That's a good sign. It's a bad sign if she lets the conversation wither into silence between you or you feel like you're doing all the heavy lifting to keep it going.

, There are some techniques you can use to build sexual tension, while monitoring how she responds and communicates back.


Move close to her and touch her, either her hands or legs. Slow down your breathing and words.
Look at her right eye. Hold the look for a few seconds, then move your gaze to her left eye. Pause again. Now, move your gaze and hold it on her mouth. She should be more receptive to a kiss (as long as she hasn't moved away!) , Women you've just met will often give you a short window of opportunity for a kiss. This can be a tricky balancing act. This will be easier if she's already your girlfriend because you will be able to spot the signs more readily.


A woman you've just met is also testing you. You need to give her signs that you like her when she seems receptive to you, otherwise she may feel rejected or insecure and start to pull away and try to make you chase her.
If you miss the window of opportunity, she may think you lack confidence or aren't interested in her. But if you try to kiss her before it opens, she might think you're boorish or too aggressive. So monitoring body language matters.

, You should always be prepared for the worst: What if you try to move closer or touch her slightly, and she moves away? Maybe she's just tired or not in a good mood. Who knows? You don't want to make it worse with a bad response. Timing is everything.


Act like nothing has occurred. Basically, show that you're not thrown off. You could even make a confident quip about her being cute when she's shy.
Don't act angry or insecure. That's not appealing to women. Maybe she's interested in you but just not ready for a kiss yet. In that case, you could work on building more common ground and intimacy- slowly. Abandon your idea for a kiss right now and instead focus on having a great conversation with her, and remember to throw in some compliments! (Women love that.)

Talk, plan activities, and spend ""couple's time,"" with form an emotional connection and attraction. Alone time creates more opportunities to go in for a kiss.


Since most people won't kiss in public, finding out if you are comfortable alone is important not just for kissing, but for your relationship.;
, Send your boyfriend the right message by staying close, pointing your shoulders towards him, and leaning in when he talks.


Twirling your hair, removing a jacket, and making eye contact tells your boyfriend that you are open to him.
Avoid crossing your arms or legs or looking down, as this makes you seem distant and unavailable.

, It's a lot easier to kiss someone who you've touched, so find ways to make physical contact before you think about kissing. Playing with his hair, holding hands, or just brushing his cheek with your hand can signal that you're ready to lock lips.


A good first step is just touching shoulder to shoulder when watching a movie or TV.

, While you don't have to go into ""makeover-mode,"" taking a little extra time to look nice will show someone that you are interested and willing to work for their affection.


Lightly use perfumes to smell amazing. Scent is one of the most powerful subconscious senses for men and women, but make sure to go easy on it. No one likes being overpowered by a smell.
Protect your lips with chapstick or lipbalm so they look soft and inviting.

, If this is your first kiss, head outside for some fresh air or snuggle up close on the couch. Take away the pressure of being in public and enjoy being together -- more often then not, the right moment will present itself.

, This is easy if you are standing, but if you are sitting, turn your body so that your shoulders line up with his.


Move your hips so that they face him.
Scoot in a little closer so you don't have to lunge for his face.

, It doesn't have to be poetry to be effective. Be sincere and kind with phrase like, ""you look handsome,"" ""I really enjoy spending time with you,"" or ""mind if I get a little closer?""


If you can't think of anything clever, or feel particularly bold, just ask if he wants to kiss. Many guys will like the forwardness.

, This is going to make it pretty obvious that you want to kiss, and that's a good thing! Smile slightly, and don't be afraid to stay nearby for a few seconds. You might be able to gauge his interest by his reaction to you.


If he leans away or turns his face it means he is probably not interested.

, If he is leaning in, looking at your lips, and brushing your hair, lean in and kiss him first.There is no reason why the boy must be the first one to make a move.

, If he leans in, go with the flow.

, Simply cocking your head to the side a little will prevent an awkward bump.

, As you approach each others lips, lock eyes. Not only will it keep you from missing, but it's incredibly romantic.

, At this point, staring at each other from that close often feels weird.

, Keep your lips light and soft. Begin by kissing him gently, but see how it feels and react to him as well.


Don't pucker your lips. Hardened lips signal that your are not really interested or aren't enjoying it. It should feel like pushing your lips against a soft peach.
Go slowly, pulling away after 2-3 seconds to see his reaction. If it is good, go in for another one for a few seconds.

, Pull him closer, place a hand behind his head, or interlock fingers.


If you don't know what to do, place your hands on his hips or his shoulders.

, As you get more comfortable with each other, change up the pressure, rhythm, and duration of your kisses to find out what he likes.


Push your lips a little closer to his.
Kiss him three of four times in a row without pulling your face too far away each time.
Go for a longer kiss, holding together for 3-5 seconds, then 5-8 seconds.
Give him a kiss on the neck, the cheeks, or the earlobes.
Don't make any quick or drastic changes. Try things slowly and take your time.

, Open kissing, or french kissing, is more playful and passionate that just kissing each other. Try initiating open kissing by:


Gently licking his top lip, then sliding to the bottom lip.
Lightly bite on his bottom lip.
Turn your head slightly to side. It's easier to open kiss if your noses aren't in the way!
Open your own mouth a bit, inviting him to join.
Dart your tongue lightly in his mouth.
If he reciprocates or opens his mouth, he is telling you he wants to do this too, so keep experimenting.

, Communication is key in every aspect of a relationship, and kissing is no exception. Briefly saying that ""I liked that,"" or ""let's try this,"" will ensure that your partner is doing the right things to keep you happy.

Don't beat yourself.",How to Be a Better Girlfriend," Being a better girlfriend sometimes just means being more available. Sometimes, you need to make your relationship a priority above other commitments you have. Being there for your boyfriend or girlfriend is a simple way to show that you care for the person.For example, try to make sure you make time at least once a week to spend time together. You can go out on a date or just hang out together at home.
Try to fit in time when you can. You don't always need to go on a dinner date. Try meeting for lunch or even breakfast.
Spending time together doesn't always mean sitting down and talking, though that's important. Try fitting each other in while you're doing other things, such as working out together or even grocery shopping together.;
, Another way to show your partner that you care is to check in daily, whether you're living together or not. For instance, text them at work just to tell the person you're thinking about them. Call them at night to see how their day went, or if you live together, make sure you take time to check in with them in the evening.In other words, make time in each day to connect with your partner. You don't need to send twenty texts a day, though if you both are up for that, that's a good way to connect. Establish what works for both of you. That is, if one person isn't big on texting, maybe email would work better or a phone call in the evening.
Try to move beyond just, ""How was your day?"" Ask about each other's long-term dreams or talk about what you're grateful for. Discuss what you value or what you like best in a friend. It can be easy to slip into ""How are you?"" ""Fine, how are you?"" Digging deeper, though, will bring you closer.While having weekly or bi-weekly dates is good, checking in every day keeps you in touch with how the other person is doing and creates a sense of familiarity and intimacy.

, Everyone likes to be appreciated and not just for the things we do. Tell your partner often how grateful you are that he or she is in your life, as it will make your partner feel more appreciated and loved.For instance, you can say things like, ""I just want you to know how important you are to me. I'm so glad you're in my life.""
You can also keep it more simple, such as ""I'm so happy I got to see your face today.""
Showing gratitude doesn't have to be verbal. Give your partner a card or surprise him or her with a small gift just to show them you're thinking about them and how special they are to you. For instance, surprise them with a home-cooked meal just to say ""thank you.""

, Empathy means actually trying to feel what the other person is feeling. It takes an act of vulnerability to step into another's shoes. However, when you're in a relationship, you have to be able to feel what your partner's feeling to create a sense of intimacy and not necessarily of the sexual kind.One way to start building empathy is to be conscientious of checking in with your partner about feelings. Ask the person how he or she is feeling in a given situation.
It also means you have to stop only seeing through your eyes. Sometimes, you have to shut off how you're seeing the world for a moment to understand how your partner is seeing it. You don't have to give up your point of view. You just have to change to your partner's perspective once in a while to understand the world through his or her eyes.
That may mean that you need to shut off the voices in your head. As your partner is talking about a situation, you may find yourself raising objections or trying to convince your partner to see it differently. Instead, you need to shut those objections down and truly listen to what your partner is saying.

, The best relationships function well because both partners give equally to the relationship. Of course, at times, you're going to be giving more, and at other times, your partner is going to be giving more. However, in the end, it should even out so your both giving to the relationship.For instance, you may need to work more hours while your partner is in school, and then he or she works more hours while you finish a degree.
This step is also important in the smaller things. That is, if you live together, both of you should contributing to household chores and errands, not just one of you.

, Arrogance can drive a wedge between you. In a relationship, you're supposed to be equal partners, so when your ego seeps in, it unbalances it. Humility on both sides keep relationships in check.A little competition every now and then never hurts. However, when you start thinking you're a better person than your partner overall, that leads to an unhealthy relationship.
That doesn't mean you can't accept a compliment from your partner. If your partner tells you you're great at something, saying ""Thank you!"" is appropriate.
However, telling your partner in a serious tone that she's terrible at something and you do it better isn't appropriate. It only serves to drive a wedge between you two.

, In a relationship, it's important to be supportive of each other's interests. If you're trying to be a better girlfriend, it's important to support your boyfriend or girlfriend in what they do and encourage them.For instance, one kind of support is not ragging on them when they want to spend time away from you to develop an interest.
Another way to encourage the person is to be their cheerleader. When something good happens, make sure to celebrate it with them.

, Relationships are built on kindness and respect. When trying to be a better girlfriend, you can show respect in a number of ways, from listening well to being fully present when you are with the person.For instance, give the person your full attention when you go on a date. Don't be looking at your phone or watching the television that's on in the restaurant.
Another way to show respect is to be sensitive to any cultural issues your partner may have. For instance, if your partner mentions that his or her family likes to do something a certain way, don't just laugh it off because you like to do it differently.
Another way to be respectful is to be forgiving rather than blaming. When your partner makes a mistake, offer forgiveness to him or her, rather than tearing them down for it., Small acts of kindness make the day-to-day life with your boyfriend or girlfriend worth living. On your side, being a better girlfriend means being intentionally kind to your partner.Kindness can show up in so many ways. It can mean being considerate of needed alone time. It can mean showing up with a cup of coffee when you know your partner needs it.
It can also mean something as simple as holding their hand when they're feeling a little anxious.
Kindness can also be doing a chore your partner hates, like running to the dry cleaners, before she has a chance to.
It's all the small things that add up to show you care for the person.

, We all have times we need to vent or to talk about something that's bugging us. When you're in a relationship, you become each other's place to discuss what's going in your lives. However, you have to make sure you create the space for that, both time-wise and emotionally.In other words, if you always cut your partner off when they start talking about something that's bothering them, that's not creating the emotional space for them to talk.
In addition, you have to open the door sometimes. When you notice your partner is looking down or sad, try to ask them what's going on.

, Listening is an art. You've got to really pay attention to what the other person is saying, not just trying to figure out how to respond. When you're in a serious discussion, for example, you may have a tendency to get defensive based on just a few things your partner says without really hearing them out. Trying to truly understand what their trying to say rather than getting defensive can lead to better communication.As they're talking, take in what they're saying. Open up to what's underneath the words, not just what they're saying aloud.Show them you're listening by asking leading questions. You can also offer short summaries. For instance, you could say, ""What I hear you saying is your upset because I'm not spending enough time with you."" That helps them know you're listening, plus it helps you to know you are getting it right., A cue is when your girlfriend or boyfriend casually mentions something that they are interested in. In turn, you take that cue and respond appropriately, sometimes by asking about the interest, sometimes by taking action.For example, say your girlfriend says something like, ""Isn't that car adorable? My car is getting so run down."" You could say, ""Oh, are you considering get a new car?"" or you could ask her if she wants to go test drive one.
Another example is if your boyfriend mentions a new restaurant going in down the street that looks good. You could take the initiative and make reservations.
Picking up on verbal cues shows you are listening and paying attention.

, A person's body language can tell you as much about the person as what the person is actually saying. The body reveals underlying thoughts and feelings, so paying attention can help you put together what your partner is actually saying.For instance, if the person turns away from you while you're talking, it could mean they've lost interested or they're trying to hide something.If they're not looking at you, it could indicate they're hiding something or that they're having trouble getting out what they want to say. It can also be a sign of embarrassment.If they cross they're arms, it could mean they're starting to get defensive about the conversation., That doesn't mean you can't discuss problems. What it does mean is you try to keep your language positive and the way you hold the discussion positive. When you start out a discussion in a positive light, it has less of a chance of escalating. It also means your partner is more likely to listen and hear you, just as you're more likely to listen and hear your partner if he or she isn't yelling at you or being angry.In other words, try not to have arguments when you're very angry, as they can just escalate into nastiness.
Humor can keep discussions light, as can affection gestures, such as hugging or lightly touching the person's hand or shoulder., Sometimes, when you're really angry, you want to discuss the problem right then. However, that means the conversation is going to be overly charged with emotion, and you probably won't get anywhere except into a fight. It's okay to wait until you've calmed down to have a discussion.A 2-day rule is a good bet. That is, you should bring it up within two days if you still feel strongly about it. If not, drop it.If you must deal with the issue today, try taking an hour break. Go spend some time doing something you enjoy, such as listening to music or reading a book. Once you've distracted yourself for a while, you'll be better able to deal with the situation.

, If you let small things go too often, sometimes they can snowball into something bigger. Deal with issues as they arise, and you're less likely to blow up at your partner. For instance, if you hate it when your boyfriend doesn't call at night, bring it up. If you let it keep happening, it can grow into this huge thing that comes between you and him, and then you'll explode on him.
You could say, ""Hey, I know your busy at night, but I feel upset when I don't hear from you. I like to know your safe.""

, In a relationship, you have to take care of yourself as well as your partner. In fact, sometimes you need to take care of your own needs first so that you can be supportive of your partner.That means, of course, that you must know what your needs are. Maybe you need alone time once in awhile, or maybe you need cuddly time at least once a week.
Once you know what you need, express those needs to your partner. Have a conversation about what both of you need, both in and out of the relationship. Try to make a plan about how both of your needs can be met. For instance, you could say, ""I really need cuddle time once a week."" Your partner might counter with, ""I'm happy to give you cuddle time. I love cuddling with you. But I also need to spend a bit of time apart as well.""

, Just because your partner is saying you need to be a better girlfriend doesn't mean you are being a bad one. In other words, you need to look for signs of emotional abuse in your relationship. You can find yourself in a emotionally abusive relationship without even realizing it.For instance, some signs of an emotionally abusive relationship can be that your partner is hypercritical of you, humiliates you, shuts you out completely, and/or gets very angry and moody much of the time.Other signs can be overusing a sarcastic/mean tone, being dominating, making you feel guilty often, and blaming you for everything that goes wrong.You may also notice that your partner embarrasses you on purpose, is very controlling, calls you all the time to see where you are (and not in a caring way), or is overly jealous.If your partner does one or even a couple of these once in a while, it may not be abusive. However, if your partner does it all the time with the intention of making you feel bad, humiliating you, or controlling you, then that is definitely a sign of emotional abuse. Look for the phrase, ""I love you, but..."" That's often a sign of a controlling person.
Be aware that many abusers will apologize for their behavior to draw you back in.

, It may seem silly, but getting enough sleep can be essential for maintaining a good relationship. When you get enough sleep, you're more pleasant to be around, and you have more energy. However, it goes deeper than that. Getting enough sleep helps you maintain self-control.Sleep affects your glucose levels, which in turn affects your self-control. If you don't have enough self-control, you tend to snap at your partner and not be available for what he or she needs.Make sure you are getting your require 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. Staying on a sleep schedule, meaning you go to bed and get up at the same time every day, can help you get enough sleep and feel more rested.
If you have trouble remembering to go to bed, try setting an alarm at night. Set for an hour before you need to be in bed. When it goes off, turn off all electronics and head for bed.

, Just like sleeping well, eating well contributes to overall well-being. When you don't eat well or you leave yourself feeling hungry, you have more of a tendency to snap at your partner. Try to keep up with eating healthy meals regularly, so you won't be tempted to snap.Don't forget to eat lean proteins, fresh fruits and veggies, whole grains, and low-fat dairy to put you at your healthiest.

, Everyone has emotional triggers. You know the type. That small thing that will set you off, usually because of something that happened in the past. Knowing your emotional triggers is important because you can learn to calm yourself down when they pop. In addition, you can provide warning to your partner, as well as an explanation of why you get so upset.If you're not sure what you're emotional triggers are, pay attention when you get really upset, but you don't actually have a good reason. Try to think about what set you off.
Write down these instances and what you think caused it. As you write more down, you'll start to notice certain patterns.

, Just like you should be kind to your partner, it's important to be kind to yourself, as well. Being kind to yourself helps you to feel better, and in turn, be kinder to your partner.For instance, if you make mistake, tell yourself it's okay. You can learn from it and move on, not beat yourself up.
Remind yourself that no one's perfect. You make mistakes just like everyone else in the world and just be yourself that's what your boyfriend loves about you.

Try not to label the relationship too early.,
Do something creative.,
Consider your other dating options.,
Be willing to be vulnerable.",How to Avoid Falling Too Hard for Someone1," Some people try to label relationships early to relieve some of the anxiety that they feel about where things are going.However, putting a label on your relationship in the early stages may be too much for your new guy or girl. It may also increase your feelings of anxiety if your new love interest does not want to put a label on what you have. Instead, try to avoid any labels for now and just have fun.


If anyone asks about your new guy or girl, just play it cool and say something like, “We just hang out sometimes. He/she is fun to be around.”;
, Your creativity may be amplified in the early stages of your relationship, so you may want to take advantage of that. Spending time on creative activities is also a good way to release anxiety and enjoy your alone time.For example, if you like to paint, then paint something. If you enjoy playing guitar, then write some new songs.

, Showing too much emotion early in a relationship can cause some people to feel uncomfortable. Men may gain an additional advantage by holding off on showing emotions too early on because some women associate a lack of emotion with manliness. It is good to be warm and loving in relationships, but holding back a bit in he first few months is a good idea.You may feel like you have found “the one,” but keep in mind that there are lots of other people you can date. Remind yourself that there are lots of other guys/girls out there who would love to date you.


If you start feeling the urge to call your new guy or girl several times per day or if you just can’t stop thinking about him or her, try thinking about other guys/girls you could date. Maybe the cute guy who rides the bus with you? Or the pretty barista at your favorite coffee shop?

, Although you may be afraid to be open with your new love interest, refusing to open up at all can also put a damper on a relationship. At some point, you will probably have to be brave and share something personal about yourself with your new guy or girl.When you are ready, try telling your new love interest something that you dream about doing, such as opening your own restaurant or getting an advanced degree. Or, share something that only your close friends know about, such as a fear that you have or something traumatic that happened to you as a child.
By sharing little personal things like this you will be building a closer relationship. As long as you do not share too much too soon, this is a healthy way for relationships to progress.

Ask the person’s friends how they acted in previous relationships.,
Talk to the person about their core values.,
Take note of times you feel uncomfortable or angry around the person.",How to Avoid Getting Romantically Involved with the Wrong Person1," Go on dates with the person to determine who they are. When people become sexually intimate, endorphins are released in their brains which produces pleasure, and can create an emotional attachment.This could cloud your judgement on someone who isn’t objectively a good partner.

When you go on dates with the person, talk to them and see if you feel happy around them.
Consider what interests you share, how easily conversation flows, and how well you get along.;
, A good indication of a person’s personality is the company that they keep. A person without good social supports like family or close friends may be more likely to experience a decline in physical and mental health.Friends are not always an indication of exactly who the person is, but can give you insight into what the person likes in people, their moral code, and what they find acceptable in others.
Friends can also influence people’s decision making, whether it’s being responsible or indulging in things., Some common red flags include being immature, irresponsible, unpredictable, or controlling. Not having a job or skipping school are two signs that you may not be able to rely on them for support. If you feel insecure about the relationship as a result of this, then spend some time evaluating the other person.If the person is physically, emotionally, or verbally abusive, then leave the relationship immediately.
If the person speaks about their exes obsessively, or in an aggressive way, this could be a sign that they aren't ready for a new relationship., Once you get more comfortable around a person’s friends, you can ask them questions about how that person was in previous relationships, or who they are according to their friend’s perspective.


If the person is good dating material, usually their friends will talk about the positive aspects of their personality.
If their friends talk about problems, drama, fighting, or anger, you may want to steer clear of the person you have your eye on.
It’s important to identify the behavior of the person you are interested in, not the unfortunate circumstances of his past relationships.

, Core values are a set of firmly held beliefs that dictate how you live your life and how you value those around you.You don’t have to be direct here, but you can ask them about what their spiritual, social, moral, and political beliefs are.


Ask the person about their stance on monogamy and commitment. If these differ from your views, don’t get romantic with the person.
You can also ask questions to determine how much they value money, passion, romance, or career. Think about how well their responses match up with your own life goals.

, Romance should be about joy, passion, and excitement. When two people are together, they should be positive influences in each other’s lives, not a constant source of anger or anxiety.


If you feel uncomfortable or angry more often than you feel happy and motivated, then this person is probably not the right person for you.

Before you attract a man, you need to develop self-confidence.,
Develop your own identity and standard of values.,
Maintain meaningful and loving personal connections.",How to Attract Any Man1," If you're not happy with who you are, it'll show from a mile away. Men are most attracted to women who look like they're having fun with who they are, not those who are desperately seeking someone to fill a void in their lives. Here are some tips for improving your self-confidence:


Tell yourself what an awesome person you are! Remind yourself of your best attributes and skills, and be proud of what makes you unique. Keep a journal where you can highlight some of your strengths as a person to make you feel that you are worthy of a man's attention. Always keep a positive attitude! Set your mind to it!
Remember that you're beautiful on the inside--and the outside. Though we are all far from perfect, before you spend an evening out, it's important to look in the mirror and remember your best attributes, whether it's your rocking smile, your perfect teeth, or your mile-long legs. If you focus on the positive aspects of your appearance, men will see them too. If you have crooked teeth or hairy legs, who gives a damn! Be yourself, and don't be afraid to show that crooked smile of yours or your beautiful hairy legs! NEVER be ashamed of yourself!
Be confident when you meet new people. Interacting with new people can be scary, but if you're alert, ready for anything, and reserve judgment, people will want to get to know you. A man will be more attracted to a woman surrounded by friends than one who is looking sad and lonely. He'll want to be a part of your positive energy. Read more about how to feel good about yourself here.
Continue to improve. It's one thing to be self-confident and another to be self-absorbed or blind to one's flaws. As you focus on your good qualities, work to improve that which can be improved. Consider all constructive criticism before dismissing it.;
, A man is attracted to a woman who feels comfortable with where she came from, where she is now, and where she is going. He wants someone who is comfortable with her desires, her limitations, and her aspirations.


Developing your own identity before you meet a man will ensure that you don't completely change who you are for him, or follow his lead all too often.
Knowing who you are before you meet a man will also make it ten times easier to talk to him, and to attract him. Men want women who look like they'd be just fine without them. Just find yourself and really think about it!
Compare me not! A lot of people fall into a cycle of comparing themselves to the people around them instead of their own standards. If you like your outfit when you leave the house, you should still like it when you get home. Don't let other people or your perceptions of other people influence how you feel about yourself.

, The key to feeling good about yourself is to have a space to be yourself and be loved for that self. Friends, family, and other personal interactions are necessary for you to feel loved and deserving of love.


Make sure your personal connections are beneficial to your emotional state. Toxic and detrimental relationships, past and present, can affect the way you feel about yourself and the way you carry yourself. Find friends who focus on your positive attributes, offer helpful advice, and are honest about who you are and who you can be.
Have a warm relationship with your family members. Making time to speak to the people who have known you the longest can remind you of your roots, and of how much you've grown.

Stay well groomed.,
Buy nice clothes that fit.,
Wear red.,
Stay moderately fit.,
Have good posture.,
Buy with him in mind.,
Give yourself a mini makeover.,
Smile.",How to Attract Your Husband1," There are a lot of aspects of your appearance that you cannot control. Luckily, however, attraction is based more on those parts of your appearance that you can control.Staying neat, clean, and paying attention to your appearance will attract your husband more effectively than undertaking any drastic makeovers.Be sure that you:


Brush your teeth twice a day
Shower regularly
Shave or trim as appropriate
Keep your hair combed and neat;
, You shouldn't have to change your style to please your husband. However, having clean clothes that fit your body are key to seeming attractive.It also helps to wear clothes that are a bit more formal, so avoid sweatpants or ripped jeans.Look for comfortable, natural fabrics that are easy to care for such as cotton, wool, and silk: this will help you keep your clothes in great shape.


If you struggle to find clothes that fit, consider finding a store that specializes in your body type. The clerks should be able to guide you to well-fitting clothes that suit your tastes.

, Men tend to be more attracted to women wearing red than women who wear other colors.Red evokes passionate feelings and emotions, so buy some special red clothing, undergarments, and lingerie if you want to make an impression.

, Age does not do the human body any favors. You don't need to be supermodel skinny or have a six-pack to look attractive to your husband, however.Simply manage your weight through a nutritious diet and moderate exercise to keep yourself healthy and in shape.


Maintaining a healthy and moderately fit physical appearance will also help you feel more self-confident. Self-confidence is often an attractive quality.
A little will usually go a long way. Take a brisk walk 20 minutes each day. Cut back on portion sizes and high calorie foods.

, Good posture makes your body look its best and inspires feelings of attraction in others.Stand up straight, sit up straight, and resist the urge to slump or slouch. Keep your head up and your shoulders back in order to appear your best.

, Once in a while, buy some sexy lingerie or a similarly sultry piece of clothing. Show it to your husband and let him know that you made the purchase with him in mind. You can also consider purchasing something eye-catching in his favorite color.


The way you deliver the message can have just as big an impact as the message itself. For example, casually slip your newest piece of lingerie into his hand, then silently walk away with a slight sway in your hips. Your body language can convey more meaning than the words alone would.

, You don't need to completely transform your appearance: changing even one quality in a subtle way can be enough to catch your husband's eye again.Consider getting a new hairstyle, adding highlights to your hair, or treating yourself to a day at the spa to give your skin a new glow. If you don't want the expense or permanency of a bigger change, try something as simple as buying a new shade of lipstick or eye makeup.

, Smiling is one of the most significant acts you can do to catch a man's eye when you're single, so it's little wonder that smiling at your man once you've married him will move him in the same way. Looking friendly, pleasant, and happy are keys to making your husband feel attracted to you."

Evaluate past relationships.,
Change your expectations.,
Look beyond physical attraction.,
Talk to your friends about your dating habits and the person you’re interested in.,
Think about experiences that may shape your dating habits.",How to Avoid Getting Romantically Involved with the Wrong Person2," There’s a good possibility that if you get romantically involved with the wrong person, that this is due to relationship patterns that you developed in childhood. Think of recurring themes in your relationships, what went wrong, the kind of people you typically date, and what actions led up you to becoming romantically involved with the wrong person in the past.Try to be as honest with yourself as you can be when evaluating past relationships. It may be hard to reflect on these past relationships, but it’s a critical step to improving.
If you can determine a similar trait in the people you’ve dated in the past, you can make sure to specifically look out for that in future relationships.

, Sometimes people’s expectations of other people can be unrealistic when it comes to romance. While you do not have to lower your standards, you may want to think critically about your expectations when looking for a person, and consider whether your expectations are realistic or unattainable. Try making a list of your expectations and examine them one by one to see if they are realistic and attainable.


For example, if one of your expectations is ""the person must be rich,"" then this might not be realistic. However, you could revise this to something like, ""I want to become involved with someone who has a stable job and some ambition.""
Sometimes people’s expectations of a person are high in areas that don’t matter in the long run, like how attractive or trendy the person is, but low in areas that actually matter like personality, humor, or temperament.
Movies and TV shows can also alter your expectations of a romantic relationship. Do not rely on entertainment to form your idea of a healthy romantic relationship., Our prefrontal cortex determines whether we find someone physically attractive within milliseconds, but cannot determine the character of a person within that same period of time.If you regularly get romantically involved with the wrong person, it could be because your brain is tricking you into thinking that the person is an ideal match based upon looks alone.


Take your time with the person and be objective when basing your opinion on them.
Do not let things go that you normally wouldn’t because you find the person attractive. For example, if the person is rude to you, do not let this go simply because you find him or her attractive.
The best balance in a romantic relationship is someone that you find emotionally, mentally, and physically attractive.

, Your friends will have a more objective view of the person you are and what may be good in a partner for you.Use your friends collective advice to avoid getting into the same situation, and introduce your friend to new potential romantic interests so that they can tell you if they think that the person is a good match for you.


If you ask your friends about an aspect of your personality and they say something negative, don’t get mad or else they may stop giving genuine feedback.
If your friends encourage you to try to date a person you may not initially like, take a chance and see if their opinions have any merit.

, Your childhood, and how you were raised can significantly influence how you approach and react to romantic relationships.In addition, past negative experiences in relationships can also alter your views and dating habits. Make sure to keep these negative experiences in mind, and look at them from an analytical view so you can overcome bad habits.


If you’ve been in bad relationships in the past, you don’t have to repeat that in the future. Identify how and why the relationship went bad, the type of person they were, and how to avoid it in the future. For example, a past relationship might not have worked because the person was not ready for a commitment. Perhaps he or she was more interested in a casual relationship. You might be able to avoid a similar situation by mentioning your interest in something long-term earlier in the relationship, such as on your second or third date.
If you continually date the same type of person, take a chance and get romantic with someone who does not share similar traits of the people you’ve dated in the past. For example, if you tend to date outgoing women, but you are more of an introvert, then you might try to find a girl who is more of an introvert as well.

Your happiness is paramount, and while you may be tempted to put other people’s lives over yours, keep in mind that romance should not detract from the rest of your life. Romantic relationships should, and can be physically, emotionally, and spiritually rewarding without being a detriment to the other aspects of your life.


If being romantically involved with someone means putting your life on hold, reevaluate the relationship.

, Instead of waiting for someone to come to you, seek people who fit your criteria. After you determine what would be good in a romantic relationship, seek those people out in social situations.


You can write down a check-list of ideal qualities in a romantic relationship and strive for them.For example, perhaps you want someone who loves to read, enjoys spending time in nature, and who listens to you.

, Don’t be desperate for romance. Desperation often leads people to do things they wouldn’t normally do. In addition, desperation can actually make you less attractive to the people around you.Do not get obsessed with the idea of being romantically involved with someone to the point where you lose all selectivity when looking for someone.
If you feel impatient, try to remind yourself that you are waiting for the right person and it will be worth the wait.

, Don’t neglect your career for romance. If romance is on your mind, it may be hard to concentrate on other things, but it’s important to keep your own personal priorities and goals in mind. Determine what you want to do in your life other than your romantic or social relationships, and make sure to strive for those goals.


You can balance romance and career or school, just make sure that you’re allocating enough time in both to make it rewarding."

Look the part.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Give your body the royal treatment.",How to Attract Any Man2," Now that you're feeling beautiful on the inside, it's time to show off your looks through the right clothes and makeup. You don't need to go on a shopping spree, but you should find the look that will help you snag a man.


Find clothes that emphasize your best attributes. If you have toned arms, go for a tank top, or if you want to show off your long legs, find the perfect dress and heels for your body. Make yourself look a little fun but do not always focus on that; focus on in the inside too!
Dress appropriately for the occasion. If you're hoping to attract a man at a wedding, for example, look classy--not trashy. You don't want a man to think that your body is your best feature--it's just one of the things that makes you unique. However, if you're out at a club, avoid business-casual attire, which will make you stick out like a sore thumb. If you are going to a a party, than sure! Go show off those pretty legs of yours, or your nice arms, but don't get too skimpy and inappropriate; watch what you wear
Have the right hair and makeup. Light hair and makeup maintenance can go a long way in emphasizing your best features. Most men prefer a natural look, so avoid trying too hard by applying too many layers of makeup or hairspray. Well, if you ask me it would be best to not where make-up, and show your natural beauty, but if you would like to put on a bit, then be my guest! But too much can make you look like you're trying too hard.

, That new dress or new found self-confidence won't have much of an effect on the man of your dreams if you haven't showered in a week. It's important to stay clean and smell nice. I would wear some deodorant, or the slightest spritz of perfume! But not to much because some people react very poorly to it, and who knows what could happen?


Shower at least every other day, and definitely on the day of a special occasion. It's important for your body to smell fresh. And you never know what could happen!
Wash your hair as often as you need to. Some women wash their hair every day, while others take more time between washes. Find whatever works for you in order to keep your hair from looking greasy.
Keep a clean mouth. Remember to brush your teeth and use mints or gum to keep your breath fresh when you need to. You can even test the smell of your breath by blowing into your hands. Nothing will turn off a man faster than a beautiful woman with dragon breath!

, Though a real man will love you for who you are, being health-conscious and working out will help you maintain a trim figure and will boost your confidence in the process. If you feel great about your body, any man you meet will feel the same.


Exercise at least three times a week for at least thirty minutes, or more. A solid work-out regimen is essential to getting and staying healthy. Don't let your routine stagnant - keep challenging yourself as you get stronger and fitter.

If you don't have a lot of time to set aside for exercise, consider ways in which you can add more walking to your daily routine.
If you don't care for exercise for the sake of exercise or health, find an external motivation - for instance, take a local kickboxing or boxing class because you want to be able to defend yourself, or taking a yoga class because you want to make some new friends.


Eat healthy. Moderation is a key in life, so take the time to splurge on your favorite ice cream or pizza, while also taking time to eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and food that is rich in nutrients. Avoid processed or greasy foods as much as you can. Your body will feel better, and your skin will look better.

Make a good first impression.,
Establish eye contact.,
Have positive body language at all times.",How to Attract Any Man3," Now that you feel amazing both physically and emotionally, it's time to attract that special someone.


Remember that you only get one first impression, so have a positive attitude before you meet the man in question.

, The first thing you can do is establish eye contact to show a man you're interested.


Hold his gaze for just the right amount of time. You don't have to stare into his eyes for hours, but looking at him for just a few seconds from across the room will show that you're interested.
Be coy yet approachable. When you look at the man, try not to look too eager, but make it clear that you would be happy if he started a conversation with you.
Let your facial expressions do the talking. Once the man approaches you, don't forget to smile, smile, smile! Nothing says that you're friendly and attractive like a good smile.
Smile--but don't over think it. Make your smile something you approach the world with. Not only will this make your smile more natural and frequent, but you will feel happier in general. Try smiling when you're not happy - you'll find that some happiness bubbles up. You don't have to look overly-eager when you smile--just be natural.

, Now that your man has seen the look in your eyes, as well as your pearly whites, it's time to use your body to show him the attraction is mutual.


Carry yourself in a confident manner. Don't slouch, look at your feet, or cross your arms over your chest. Avoid nervous actions such as playing with your hair or biting your nails. Instead, face the man and keep your arms moving through gestures. This will make you seem like an open and dynamic person.
Show him that you're interested. If you're feeling his love, there's no harm in leaning in to hear him talk, especially if you're in a loud or crowded place. A light touch on the arm or knee can also show him that you like what he has to offer without being too aggressive.
Physically hold his attention. Make sure to maintain eye contact and to avoid looking around--or even worse, checking your phone every five minutes--when he's talking to you. He wants to feel like he's the only person in your world, and nothing will turn a man off faster than someone who checks her email every two minutes instead of holding up her end of the conversation. Touch him but not in the weird way but a friendly/flirty kinda touch like when he is right you agree and smile and touch his knee? But always find some way to get close!

"
"
Just say ""yes"".,
Don't be afraid to be funny.,
Show off your sharp mind.,
Show what makes you unique.,
If the conversation goes well, make plans to meet again.,
If your plan fails, don't despair.",How to Attract Any Man4," This doesn't mean you should agree with any strange idea your dream man may have, but it does mean you should have a positive attitude and be interested in what he has to say.


If he asks if you've been to a certain restaurant, don't cut off the conversation by saying no; instead say that you've heard great things about it and ask questions about his experience. It's likely this is his way of asking you for a date!
If he's teasing you, play along. Enjoy his playful personality. If you say ""no"" to any slightly offbeat idea he may have, you will look prudish, and not like someone he wants to hang out with.
Don't be overly disagreeable right away--even if you disagree. If you find out that your favorite sports teams are arch rivals, or that you fall on opposite sides of the political spectrum, don't start a fight about it. Being playful about your differences is one thing, but getting on a soap box about your views will make you look stubborn and selfish.

, Men love women who have a great sense of humor and who are confident enough to show it off.


Though this may not be the time for knock-knock jokes, don't be afraid to throw in a joke or two if the occasion is appropriate.
Show that you can laugh at yourself. No man wants a woman who takes herself too seriously--showing that you can laugh at your own foibles will show not only that you have confidence, but that you're aware of your flaws. Men don't want a girl who is ""too perfect"" and this will make them feel more secure about themselves.

, Don't be afraid to show off your brains for fear of intimidating a man. If he's the right guy, he'll be attracted by how smart you are, and will want to spend more time picking your brain.


Show him your knowledge of current events, historical figures, or even your witty analysis of pop culture. If you know what you're talking about, he'll be pleased to hear you pontificate about any subject.
There's a difference between sounding smart and showing off. Avoid bragging about where you went to college, what you got on the SATs ten years ago, or any other information that may make it sound like you're floating your own boat.

, There are plenty of confident, funny, and smart women out there, but there is only one you. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there to show what makes you who you are.


If it's appropriate, tell him a funny or interesting story from your past that will give him a sense of what kind of person you are and what kind of experiences have shaped your life.
Don't be afraid to share your interests. If you're teaching yourself French or are learning to ride the unicycle, tell him about it. He'll be impressed that you're marching to the beat of your own drum and will be impressed by your zest for new things.
Share something about your friends or family. While you want to avoid telling him that you can't wait to introduce him to Mom and Dad after you've just exchanged names, you can say a few things about who your family and friends are to show who has influenced you to be your best possible self.

, Part of attracting a man is keeping him interested. If the flame of love is glowing, you should add logs to the hearth!


Though you can still play coy, make sure to exchange information before you leave if the attraction is mutual. You should avoid coming on too strong, but express an interest that will make the man see that you want to spend more time with him. You'd be surprised by how shy many men are, and how happy they are when women step up and take the initiative.

, Unfortunately, certain men may not be attracted to you no matter how hard you try. But don't sweat it--there are plenty of men out there, and you've made yourself a better person already by following these tips! If the man you're seeking doesn't recognize your new confidence, looks, or conversational skills, then someone else will come along who will never want to leave your side.


Though you may try to attract a man with all your might, his heart may be taken. Even if he's not in a serious relationship, he may have had a recent heartbreak or could be pining for someone else, and there's nothing you can do to change that.
If you're rejected, play it off. There's no need for waterworks or angry text messaging if your crush doesn't reciprocate your feelings. Hang tough and the right guy will come along!

Confidence is an attractive quality, and conversely, a lack of confidence can make you seem unattractive.Tell yourself that you are sexy, attractive, and interesting. Focus on your favorite qualities about yourself, and remember that your husband fell in love with you for a good reason.


Speaking confidently and having a confident, upright posture will help you demonstrate your self-esteem.
If you are unable to remove the negative thoughts you have about yourself, consider taking up practices like meditation or therapy for a little extra help.

, Being able to care for yourself emotionally can help you maintain a more positive attitude.

Spend time with your close friends and family
Work on a hobby
Take a class in something you are interested in

, Don't take your husband for granted. Value the time you spend together, and seek out quality time with him.Schedule dates or other ways to check in throughout the day. Talk to one another on the phone, Skype, or text at least once a day in order to display that he is in your thoughts.

, It can be hard to focus on a marriage when you have kids, careers, homes, and other responsibilities.

Develop inside jokes
Go to a live comedy show

Initiate sex

Take an interest in his interests. You don't need to force yourself to love everything he feels passionately about, but encourage him to talk to you about his passions by being an active listener.
Do something special for him every once in a while. Plan a surprise party on his birthday or cook his favorite meal. Offer to pack him a lunch or give him a shoulder massage after an especially long, tiresome day at work.
Show sympathy if he is having a hard time.

, You might be tempted to think that making your husband jealous will cause him to come rushing to your side. However, this sort of thinking backfires more often than not. Attract your husband with your honesty and care, not with dangerous games.

, Don't let problems in your marriage fester. Talk through your conflicts and problems in order to clear the air.If your husband seems distant or withdrawn, sit down with him and talk about what the problem is. Once everything is brought out into the open, the two of you can figure out how to make things better together.


Understand that problems in your marriage might have nothing to do with you. If your husband no longer finds you attractive, there could be a medical problem behind it, or there can be something going on with him psychologically, spiritually, or emotionally that you have no control over.

Be confident in who you are.,
Be comfortable with how you look.,
Love what you do.",How to Attract Women1," The first step to getting women to like you is to like yourself. If you're not happy with who you are, then the woman across the room is likely to not be impressed, either. Here are some ways to gain confidence in who you are:


Be aware of your best attributes, whether it's your sense of humor or ability to make anyone open up. Emphasize them whenever you meet someone new.
Work to address your flaws. Nobody's perfect, but you can become a better person by making a concerted effort to improve yourself.
Confidence is key, but if you're too pleased with yourself, you may come off looking arrogant, and that is a big turn-off.
Learn to make fun of yourself. Without being self-deprecating, making the occasional joke about yourself will show that you don't take yourself too seriously.;
, You don't have to be a body builder to have a healthy body and to be happy with how you look. If you're not self-conscious about your body, you won't be a chick magnet. Here are some ways to improve the way you feel about how you look:


Be brave and take a dance or power yoga class. Not only will you improve the way you look, but you'll definitely meet some ladies in the process.
Hitting up the gym a few times a week can improve your cardio, your muscle tone, and your self-esteem.
Eat healthy foods. Eat three balanced meals a day and eat as many fruits and vegetables as you can. Avoid anything processed or fatty as much as you can, but splurge on the foods you really want once in a while.
Dress well. Take time to wear well-fitting pants, clean shirts, and shoes that match your outfits. Making the effort to look nice will show the ladies that you're likely to make effort in other parts of your life, too.

, If you want to attract ladies, you should already be happy with not only who you are and how you look, but with how you spend most of your time. If you're unhappy with your job or studies, it'll show, and the ladies will be put off by your negative attitude. Here's how to do it:


If you're working, try to love your job as much as possible by building a relationship with your coworkers, appreciating the perks of your work, and trying to do the best job you can so you feel good about yourself.
If you're in school, focus on the subjects that you love most so the ladies will see that there is something you're passionate about. You'll be a better student, will gain more knowledge, and will come off looking like a more interesting person.
Take up hobbies that improve your life. If you don't have many hobbies already, pick something to be passionate about, such as running, reading historical non-fiction, or building furniture. As long as you don't spend all of your time obsessing about your hobbies, you will not only be more appealing to women, but will become a better person in the process of pursuing your interests.
Let's face it---you may be in a place in your life where you don't like what you do very much. Work to change that, and in the meantime, try to keep your complaining to a minimum so the ladies don't think you're a pessimist.

This means scrubbing your body with soap and warm water, making sure to get the particular sweaty areas like underneath your arms. Shampoo your hair, and apply conditioner so that your hair is nice and soft to the touch. An older girl likes a guy that takes care of himself, and presents himself positively towards the world.After you get out of the shower, put some deodorant on.

You can even add some lotion to your hands to make them soft. If your hands are rough, the girl might not want you to touch her.;
, If you decide you want a beard, that is fine. You will want to make sure you have enough facial hair to qualify as a beard.

Make sure you trim the beard as well. Don't let it grow wild. Use razors and trimmers regularly to clean it up, nice and neat.The shaved look is much easier to maintain. Remember to shave using a razor and shaving cream every morning. Some girls like a little stubble, but you shouldn't grow it past that point. Older girls love a clean shaven man.
Don't forget as well to trim elsewhere, besides your face. Take some of that overgrown chest hair off, and maintain the hair between your legs. This shows older girls that you care about your appearance and how you present yourself.

, Older girls like to know that their guy takes care of himself, and that he wants his breath smelling nice and fresh. Brush your teeth (two minutes) twice a day, once in the morning and at night. Floss after you are done brushing in order to get rid of food stuck between your teeth. Then finish off with a mouthwash that cleans your entire mouth, and leaves it smelling fresh.Keep breath mints or chewing gum around in case you haven't brushed your teeth in a while. This will at least mask the smell, and make your breath minty fresh.

, After you get out of the shower, comb your hair so it doesn't look so messy. If you would like, you can use products out on the market, like styling gels, which allow you to make different hairdos. You want to make yourself look clean cut, and mature about how you look.Remember to get a haircut on a monthly basis. Hair running down your neck and over your ears needs to be trimmed back.

, You want to spray a tiny amount of your cologne onto ""pulse points."" These are spots where blood vessels are close to the skin. The blood creates heat, and transfers the fragrance of your cologne very well. These include under your arms, behind your knees, around your neckline, and on your wrists. However, it is very important that you do not put too much on. A lot of cologne can turn an older girl away., A lot of younger boys like to wear football or baseball jerseys. However, many older girls like to see a guy who dresses similar to themselves. If she wears belted shorts with a polo, she might be into the more ""preppy"" look. If she wears jeans and t-shirts all the time, she might prefer guys who sport a more relaxed look.Make sure all of your clothes are ironed. This shows the older girls that you care about the way you appear to the outside world, and that you care about yourself. You do not want to look as if you just rolled out of bed.
Variations on appropriate attire are natural when it comes to individuals. There is no ""perfect"" wardrobe. Use your best judgement, and try your best. It never hurts to go out and pick up some new shirts/pants at a nearby store if you don't have much in your closet.

, If your flirtation is in the early stages simply exchange a smile. Tell her how pretty she looks today, or compliment her on her outfit. Speak specifically about her as a person, about her laugh, her eyes, and any unique mannerisms you pick up on. Never touch her, especially at first. Look her in the eye when you are speaking to her to show your attention is fully on her., Stand up straight, and don't slouch. Never think that you can't date her. You have to think positively about your prospects. Older girls detect that level of confidence and are attracted to it. Speak smoothly instead of bumbling over your words. Crack a joke every once in a while that gets her to laugh. Keep a smile on your face, and never frown.Keep the conversation going. Always have something in the back of your mind to say when she is done speaking. You don't want any awkward silences.

, Talk about mature topics such as a sports team you belong to, a book you have recently read, or something you know someone her age would find interesting. Ask her where she works, what sports she plays, what college she plans on going to, and where her family is from. These are mature questions, that show that you sincerely care about getting to know her as a person, rather than as a sexual object., If she is in a debate team, for example, joining the team will get her to notice and consider you. This especially works when the girl knows that it is out of your comfort zone. For example, join the book club she is in, even if you don't like to read that much. This shows that you are willing to work in order to ask her out in the future. You not only care about what you are interested in, but what she likes as well., She can be saying nice things, but her eyes might wander off. You will want to hold her attention by the way you look, the forcefulness of your tone, or your overall endearing personality. If she just doesn't seem that interested, move onto someone else. To be a mature man, you have to understand that older girls know what they want. If she doesn't want to give you her number, or never texts you back, move on respectfully.If her arms are crossed, or her eyes are looking away while you are talking to her, she may not be that into you.
Make sure that your body is squared up with her when you talk. You want to show that your focus isn't elsewhere.

, That way, you don't look like a complete outsider and it makes you look, and feel more connected with the group. If you plan on dating the girl in the future, you will have to at least get used to her friends. If she sees you can't even pretend to get along with them, she is likely not going to be interested. Mature men however usually can create bonds of friendship with her friends. Those friends make her happy and that should make you happy.

, This is a sure way to prove you're more mature than you look and that's a good thing. Besides, dating is a major part of the road to her becoming your girlfriend. Ask her for her phone number first so that you can contact her after school hours. However, always ask her out in person, never by text or call. Older girls do not like guys who feel intimidated in their presence. Set up a clear date a time so that you do not forget.For example, a good way to ask her out is: ""Hey , I was thinking about going to dinner Friday night and wanted to know if you would like to come with?""

, The classic date is to spend a nice meal together with her. Pick her up in your car and drive her to the restaurant. Open the doors for her. This is a great moment to ask her questions, and have lively conversation. Look at her eyes as you are speaking and listening. Compliment her on that nice dress she is wearing.


Do not go out to places like movie theaters until at least your second date. For a first date you aren't looking at each other, and there isn't a chance to talk to one another. When it comes to later dates, movies can be fun experiences and give you guys something to talk about.
Bring her some flowers right when you walk up to her at the door. It's a great kick-starter, and will start your date out tremendously.

, First dates are usually never times to inquire about sex. However, you should hold her hand, perhaps during dinner, or the car ride back home. An older girl may make the first move herself, but you want to exude confidence. After you get her back home, walk her to her front door. Kiss her on the lips good night. As you are kissing her, move your hand behind her head.A first kiss good night should only last about 5-6 seconds. You do not want to make the situation awkward, or make her feel as if you want more.
Do not simply peck her on the lips or cheek. Use a little bit of tongue and show that you feel something for her. She will want more, and will be more open to dates in the future.

, Know that an older girl may be further along sexually, and she may have had more experience in this area than you. Decide upon your level of intimacy as you get to know her better. If you are not ready for further advancement, be upfront about it. If you are willing, go with the flow. Listen to her needs, and feel free to express your desires.Remember that older girls are mature, and will want to practice safe sex. Always have a condom ready in case the moment is right.
Open, honest relationships are built on a good sex life. If you can't be happy here, the relationship probably isn't going anywhere.
Spend time before and after sex teasing and cuddling. This gets the other partner in the mood, and shows you that you are mature.

, While the differential will always there, it is best not to stress over it. In the end, age differences do not mean very much. Relax, get to know her, and pursue the relationship like you would any other. Don;t listen to other people who don't understand the relationship you have., A mature man is there at all points for his girlfriend. That means when she is happy, laughing, and when she is sad, and unstable. Prove to the older girl that you are mature, and won't walk out on her. Continue to buy her flowers, bring her chocolate, and buy her cards. It can be a bit cliche at times, but it actually works. Every day that you are away, make sure you tell her that you love her.

Invite your coworker to some social event you're going to do.,
Have a friendly ""competition"" over first date ideas.",How to Ask a Coworker on a Date," Before you ever approach your coworker about going on a date, you should ensure that he or she is actually single. This can save you both a lot of time and embarrassment, and it can help keep your working relationship unaffected.


If you're friends with your coworker, you can check his or her social media for hints of a significant other.
Some social media platforms like Facebook have a designated profile line for relationship statuses. You can also browse through some of your coworker's recent photos to see if there are any pictures of your coworker holding hands or cuddling with someone else, which might indicate a relationship.
If you have a trusted friend in the workplace, you can ask him or her about the coworker you're interested in. Ask your friend to be discreet, and just say something like, ""I was thinking about asking _______ out on a date; do you know if he/she is single?""
If none of these options are available to you, you could always ask your coworker himself or herself. Just tread lightly, and try to bring it up in conversation.
For example, you might say something like, ""That sounds like a fun plan for this weekend. Are you going with your boyfriend (or girlfriend) or friends, or just by yourself?"" If your coworker is single, he or she might say something like, ""No, I'm not seeing anyone. I'm just going by myself.;
, If you know your coworker is single and you've decided to ask him or her out, you should make sure you look your best and feel confident that day. Do something that morning that will either help you relax or get you psyched up, depending on your personality. You should also make sure you feel confident by dressing for success.""


Wear your most flattering outfit. Just make sure that outfit is appropriate for the workplace.
Consider getting a haircut a few days before you decide to ask your coworker out. That way you'll look freshly-groomed and you'll make a good impression.
Make sure you shower, and wear deodorant and clean clothes that day. Spend a little extra time grooming yourself so that your hair, facial hair (if you have any), and makeup (if you wear it) are perfect.
Check your mouth in the mirror to make sure you don't have any food stuck between your teeth. Rinse with mouthwash or chew a mint shortly before you approach your coworker so that your breath is fresh and minty.

, Where and how you ask your coworker out are very important factors to consider. Even if your coworker is interested in you, he or she may have doubts or insecurities about approaching you, and so asking your coworker out in the wrong place, time, or context could create tension or even animosity.Approach your coworker when he or she is alone. If others are around, your coworker might feel uncomfortable or pressured into saying yes or no.
Choose a comfortable space where you and your coworker will both feel safe. Don't ask your coworker out right outside the bathroom, for example, or in your office (if you have one), as these locations can be intimidating or even downright improper for asking someone out.
A good place to ask might be a neutral work space, like by the copy machine in an office or when you're both behind the counter if you work in a restaurant.
Make sure your coworker isn't rushing off to do something important, as you'll want his or her full attention for a moment when you ask.

, As you chat with your coworker, it's important that you act like you normally would. If you're nervous, your coworker will notice it. And if you try to put on a fake persona, your coworker will definitely be aware of it and will most likely be turned off by it. Just remain calm and be respectful of your coworker at all times.

, The hardest part is actually asking your coworker out on a date. It can be very intimidating, but remember that you ultimately don't have much to lose. The worst that could happen is your coworker may politely turn you down, in which case you'll just smile and politely excuse yourself.

Be polite and warm when you ask. Don't come across as pushy or needy, and don't act disinterested.
Make small talk for a few moments first, so it doesn't seem like you're rushing up to ask him/her out. Ask your coworker how he or she is doing, how his/her weekend was, or how his/her day is going.
Transition smoothly into asking your coworker out. You might say something like, ""Well hey, I really enjoyed talking to you. I'd like to chat more over coffee, if you're free this weekend?""
If your coworker says yes, then say, ""Great! When would be a good time?"" If your coworker says no, be polite and cordial, but don't linger or make it awkward.

, If you've asked your coworker out and he or she is not interested, you'll need to leave it at that. Repeatedly asking a coworker out on a date who's already told you that he or she isn't interested in dating you could be considered a hostile work environment, which may end up getting you fired. Remember: if your coworker isn't interested in you, there are plenty of other people out there who would love to date you.

Pestering your coworker if he/she isn't interested is not worth the time, effort, or the possibility of losing your job.

If your coworker says no, be as polite and respectful as possible.
Say something to defuse any tension, such as, ""No problem. Well, I hope you have a good weekend.""
Excuse yourself and walk away. Lingering could make things awkward for both of you.
Be polite and courteous to that coworker going forward, but make sure you never flirt with him/her or display any romantic interest now that you know he or she isn't interested.

, The main situation in which dating a coworker is a bad idea (in fact, really the only reason at many places of employment) is if one of you is in a position of power. Dating your boss, manager, or supervisor could get you unfair favors at work. Similarly, dating your employee (if you're the manager) could potentially create a situation where your employee feels pressured to go out with you, and may be uncomfortable or unsafe breaking things off if the relationship isn't working.Only date someone you're at the same level with. As long as there is no power dynamic between the two of you, you should be able to safely date one another (as long as your place of employment allows it).
Even if you are equals now, there is always a chance that one of you may get promoted in the future. That promotion, which is great for your career, could dramatically alter the nature of your relationship at work.

, Many places of employment have specific guidelines, rules, or even prohibitions regarding workplace relationships. Before you take things to the next level, it's important to know whether your employer will allow it, as you don't want to risk one or both of you losing your job.Some workplaces require you to disclose any intra-office romances to your supervisor. Others may have even stricter policies in place.
You may need to describe the nature of your new relationship in writing, which may be difficult if you are both still figuring it out and haven't put any ""labels"" on it yet.
Be aware that if your relationship has the potential to affect either of your productivity levels, you could both be fired from the company if the relationship makes your workplace behavior unprofessional.
Check your employer's rule book (usually either given to you when you are hired or made available online). If you don't have such a rule book, ask someone who works in human resources or a similar position about any policies at your workplace.
Remember that even if workplace romances are allowed, you may get into serious trouble for public displays of affection, flirtation in the workplace, using terms of endearment at work, or giving your partner preferential treatment., Even if you and your coworker are equals, there's still a risk of a bad professional relationship if things don't work out. If you're both able to be mature adults about it, then it should be fine. However, if you will have to work closely with one another, things could get complicated if you end up breaking up.

Ask yourself honestly whether you and your coworker could continue collaborating at work if you recently broke up.
A good way to gauge this is to think back to your most recent messy breakup. Could you and your ex sit at a table together and work on a project?
If you don't think you could handle working with your coworker after a potential breakup, it may be best to avoid dating one another from the start.
If you think you could both handle it maturely, then you should go for it and ask your coworker out.

, Even if you don't have to collaborate or work closely, a messy breakup could still affect your workplace performance. Seeing one another at work everyday might be difficult, especially if one of you still has feelings for the other. This doesn't mean that things wouldn't necessarily work out if you and your coworker dated; rather, it just means that you should consider all possible outcomes before you proceed.Your performance levels may decline if one or both of you feel uncomfortable working around each other.
One of you may end up feeling obligated to leave your department or the company altogether.
If you're already friends with your coworker and are thinking about asking him/her out, you may want to have a serious chat with him/her about what you would both do if you were pressured by your boss to end the relationship. Have a backup plan in advance that you can both agree on., Don't try to wing it on the spot. If you approach your coworker, whether he/she is interested or on the fence, giving vague or ambiguous plans will likely be a turn off. Keep it casual, but know what you have in mind before you ask your coworker out.If you're not sure that your coworker is interested in you yet, asking him/her to something casual is more likely to succeed than asking him/her out to a formal dinner or movie date.
Decide in advance what you'd like to do - for example, going out for coffee, or perhaps getting a drink together after work (if you're both old enough to drink).
When you ask your coworker out, ask him/her out to whatever casual event you've planned.
Instead of leading with something vague like ""Do you want to go out with me?"" you could instead say something like, ""I'd really like to continue chatting over coffee or maybe a drink sometime, if you're free.""

, If you're worried about coming across as too forward with your coworker, you can casually ask him or her about joining you at something you're already planning on doing. Just make sure you choose something appropriate to invite your coworker to, like seeing a concert or going to a street festival.The advantage of asking someone out this way is that it often comes up naturally in conversation.
If you make small talk with your coworker, he or she will probably ask you what your plans are for the weekend at some point. This is the perfect opportunity to describe your plans, then invite your coworker.
You might say something like, ""I'm planning on checking out that concert this Saturday. I have an extra ticket - would you be interested in going with me?

, Having a friendly competition just means seeing who can come up with the best first date idea. This method of asking a coworker out would work best if you and your coworker already have a good rapport and make friendly small talk on a regular basis. The goal is, once again, to keep it casual and not make your coworker uncomfortable.


This method will only work if you and your coworker are already flirting and it's clear that you're both interested in one another.
Try to let the subject come up naturally. This can be a tricky move to pull, and the timing and execution need to be perfect or else it could sound creepy and off-putting.
If someone in the workplace had mentioned having a disastrous date recently, you might say something like, ""I feel bad for Shannon after that blind date. My ideal first date would be _______. What's yours?""
Once your coworker responds with his or her ideal first date, you can say something like, ""Wow, that actually sounds really fun. Would you maybe want to go sometime, for real?""

Be cultured.,
Develop many healthy and exciting relationships.,
Pick up some useful skills.,
Develop a sense of humor.",How to Attract Women2," Women will be attracted to you if you're a man of the world and are able to see things outside of your perspective. If you work to be more cultured, not only will you be more attractive to women, but you'll have a more informed outlook on life. Here's how to do it:


Learn a new language. You'll be able to appreciate a new culture, and if you become fluent in a sexy language like Italian or French, the ladies will be impressed and excited to hear you flatter them in a foreign tongue.
Read a wide variety of books. Reading fiction and non-fiction by a range of authors can help you appreciate how big the world is, and may give you topics to discuss with the ladies.
Travel if you can. See the world, or at least your part of the country. You will learn a lot about the world and will meet a variety of interesting people, some of whom could be sexy ladies.
Watch a variety of films. Watching both classics and current films can help you appreciate the complexity of the human existence. Your love for movies will also allow you to impress women with your insight when you invite them on movie dates.
Open your eyes to a variety of cuisine. Don't just stick to pizza and pasta--try the new Korean or Burmese place in your neighborhood. This will also help you find a great date destination.

, If you have a great relationship with your family and an eclectic group of friends, the ladies will want to be a part of your life. Women are wary of a guy without friends or a close relationship with any of his relatives, because this may indicate that he doesn't know how to get along with people, or doesn't find meaning in friendships. Here's how to work on the relationships in your life:


Make a point of seeing or talking to your family members as much as possible. How you treat your family---especially your mother---says a lot about you, and ladies will be attracted to you if you're a doting son. You don't want to look like a momma's boy, but casually showing the ladies how much you love your mother will show them that you're a caring person.
Develop an eclectic group of friends. While being best friends with everyone in your fraternity or at your cool new workplace can be a lot of fun, having a diverse group of friends can make you a more interesting person. It's great to be friends with a few guys from your fraternity, but if you've also developed relationships with your friends in your weekend soccer league, you may learn more about the world. What's more, the ladies will be attracted to your ability to be able to get along with a variety of people.
Throw any dead weight off your friend-ship. If you're hanging out with a person who is rude or unpleasant just because you've been friends for years, it may be time to reevaluate the friendship. Besides, if you bring around someone who is deeply annoying or rude, the ladies will think this is a reflection of who you are.

, If you're not only interesting to be around but actually have a lot of knowledge, the ladies will be attracted to your manliness and your ability to get things done. Here are some examples:


Learn how to cook. Start by adding just a few simple items to your repertoire. Once you perfect something, like the perfect steak or glazed salmon, you can invite the ladies over for dinner. You'll look sexy with a chef's apron on, whether you're behind a grill or in front of a stove.
Learn how to be useful around the house. Whether you know how to fix a leak or a broken table, the ladies will be turned on by your know how and may even ask you for help.

, You may be interesting and cultured, but if you won't go far if you don't know how to make a lady laugh. If you have the right sense of humor, you will be much more likely to attract the ladies. Here's how to do it:


Be clever. You don't have to be the loudest or most outgoing person in the room, but if you make a cutting or sharp comment at the right time, the ladies will be impressed.
Have the right delivery. If you have a funny comment, make sure you say it loudly enough and when no one else is talking. If you have to repeat your joke, it won't be funny anymore.
Be appropriate. Make the right jokes for the right people. If you're hanging out with your best bro-friends, your jokes should be more raunchy than they are in front of a new group of girls, and especially if you're meeting a new lover's parents for the first time.

Don't be afraid to compliment a woman.,
Show an interest in your lady's life.,
Be a thoughtful date.",How to Attract Women3," You don't have to overdo it, but the right compliment at the right time can make a woman attracted to your honesty and ability to put yourself out there. Here's how to do it:


When you first meet a girl, tell her you like a piece of her jewelry, her haircut, or one of her other accessories.
Once you get to know her, you can be more blunt. Say, ""Has anyone ever told you that you have very expressive eyes?"" Or, ""You have the sweetest laugh."" Don't be afraid to make her blush just a little bit.
Notice things about her personality. Really listen to what she says, and tell her that she sounds like a great friend, or that she has a great sense of humor.

, Your lady will be impressed by your interests and perspective, but you have to make sure to reciprocate by showing an interest in her pursuits as well. Here's how to show that you care:


Remember things she's told you. If you've met her before and bring up small details from your previous conversation, such as the name of her sister or the place where she studied abroad, she'll be attracted to how much you care.
Ask the right questions. Without sounding like you're heading an interrogation, you can ask her questions to get her perspective. Start small and ask for her opinion on topics that aren't very controversial, and once you get to know her better, you can dig deeper and ask about her perspective on balancing work and friends, or what she's looking for in a relationship.
Tease her. Once you know her well enough to know her foibles, don't be afraid to poke fun at her, as long as she goes along with it.

, Once the woman is attracted enough to go on a date with you, you want to keep her interested by continuing to be engaged on your dates. Here's how to let her know you care once you take her out:


Be a gentleman. Open doors, get her flowers, and give her your coat if she's cold.
Do the little things. Send her messages during the week to show that you're thinking of her. Get her small gifts.
Tell her you had a great time. Be honest. If you had an amazing time, let her know so you can see her again.
Once you're more comfortable, find some ways to get closer by brushing up against her. Become an expert on how to Touch a Girl.

Focus.,
Go with the 'feeling'.,
Close your eyes and say out loud, something like, ""I declare that I want my perfect mate to come into my life within the next 30 days"".,
Open your eyes and let your declaration 'go' by saying something like ""It's done."",
Spend a few minutes now saying ""thank you"" for the things you already have in your life.,
Now go about your day.,
Draw or cut out pictures of lovers, or scenes of joy and romance and put them where you will see them the minute you open your eyes every morning.,
Believe and receive.

",How to Apply the Law of Attraction for Finding a Mate," When you think of finding the perfect mate for you, there will be the hint of an image in your mind of what they might look like. Focus on it, add details to it until that 'ideal mate' is clear in your minds' eye.;
, When picturing them in your mind, there's a feeling that goes with it. FEEL that feeling. Intensely.

, FEEL intense emotions of love and joy and excitement with your declaration, while holding the image of them firmly in your mind.

, You've just sent your intention out to the Universe. There's no need to keep peeking out the window to see whether the delivery van is coming yet, and certainly no need to question or doubt whether your dream mate will be 'delivered'. You've placed your order, now let it go and let the Universe do it's part of the job..

, FEEL genuine gratitude for them, no matter how big or small they might be. For instance, ""thank you for the house I'm living in!"". ""Thank you for my friends!"", ""Thank you for my job!"", ""Thank you for this breakfast/beautiful day"", etc. Being thankful and grateful puts our mind in a higher state of frequency that will help keep our minds focused on the day our dream walks into our life.

, From now until your mate manifests, the only thing you're going to focus on is the image of your mate and at the same time, FEELING exactly the way you will feel the day they come into your life. Hold that feeling of excitement and joy and bliss! Keep it with you right through every single day until he or she arrives. The more you do that, the faster your mate will manifest.

, Every morning, rather than making your declaration all over again (because you only need to do it once), repeat steps 5 and 6 before you get out of bed, after you get out of bed, while you have a shower, while you drive to work, etc.

Think about your apology and really get to the bottom of the problem.,
Start off with a simple, blunt ""I'm sorry."",
If she asks you to leave, tell her you want to apologize.,
Calmly explain to her the reasons behind your actions.,
Give her time to respond.,
Tell her you'll give her time if she needs it.",How to Apologize to Your Girlfriend1," Anyone can say they are sorry, but not everyone can mean it and back it up with a solution. Be aware that your girlfriend might expect you to think about your actions and/or words for a while before apologizing to her. Before you issue your apology, have solid answers about:


Why you did what you did, or said what you said, to upset her.
What aspect of your personality that comes from.
How you plan on fixing it so that neither you nor your girlfriend will have to go through the pain again.;
, Don't hem or haw, or try to apologize without actually saying ""sorry."" Your girlfriend probably wants to hear those exact words, so be prepared to say them up front.

, Tell her you really want to fix the problem and get your relationship back on track. Don't yell or talk over her; you may frighten or upset her and make things worse.


If she seems really upset and doesn't want to handle your apology right now, leave. Ask her if you can give her a call in a couple days.

, If you thought about the problem (Step 1), you should have a pretty good idea about what and why you did wrong, and how you can fix it in the future.


Example: ""I know I owe you an apology. I shouldn't have lied to you or your parents about my age. I knew it was the wrong thing to do, but I didn't want you or them to not trust me because I'm older. I really care about you and your parents, so I plan on apologizing to them directly. I understand if you or they are still mad at me after this.""

Example: ""I shouldn't have looked at Stacy the way I did. I know that she's your friend, and I'd never do anything to jeopardize my relationship with you or your relationship with her. I don't have an excuse for my actions, only an explanation: lots of guys look at girls. Now that I know it really bothers you, I'll try my hardest not to make the same mistake again.""

Example: ""I apologize for calling you that name — I'm not even going to repeat it. It was wrong and degrading. I recognize that. I shouldn't have gotten worked up, and I shouldn't have let that slip. I realize that you might change your opinion of me based on that, so I'm going to try to do everything in my power to make it up to you.""


, Let her ask you all the questions she needs an answer for. Respond truthfully. A couple of things to keep in mind as you let her grill you:


Don't shift the blame. Even if you're not the only one who's at fault, it's not a good idea to blame her. Your apology won't work if you do that.
Let her express how angry, disappointed, or upset she is. Don't try to convince her not to be; she has a right to. It'll make her feel better.
Don't try to show her affection at this point — it's probably still a little too early. That means no kisses, hugs, or hand holding unless she starts it.

, Reiterate your apology again briefly and walk away if she wants time alone. Respect the way she wants to do things.

Don't immediately go for her hand.,
Be somewhere special.,
Get comfortable with her.,
Read her body language.,
Get a bit closer to her.,
Test out physical contact.",How to Ask Your Girlfriend to Hold Hands1," Holding hands should be something that is enjoyable and brings two people closer. Holding hands for the first time is a special moment because it means you are putting yourself out there. Even if you've been thinking about it for a long time, if you decide to ask her to hold hands, it shouldn't be the first thing that comes out of your mouth when you see her. This may come across as abrupt as opposed to romantic.;
, Make sure you are somewhere where you and your girlfriend feel comfortable. Try not to be somewhere that is too loud or distracting. For instance, try not to be in a really loud restaurant with TV's blaring from every side. This is probably not the place that your girlfriend wants to have this special moment with you. You also probably don't want to hold her hand for the first time in math class, or somewhere that both of you would rather not be.This moment should be about your relationship, not anything else. , Take it off your mind for a while when you first see her. Settle into how you usually are with each other and make sure that you're not thinking about it too much. If you think too much about when you are going to take her hand, you might come across as quiet, worried or even bored.


Instead of thinking ""Should I do it now? Or maybe I should do it now?"", try to relax. Make her laugh. This will make the moment even more special when it happens.
If you are nervous and can't stop worrying about when you are going to ask her, take it off the table. Think to yourself, ""I don't have to ask her today. I can always ask her some other time"". Giving yourself the option to postpone takes off the pressure and will help you relax. You may even find that it will relax you enough to actually go through with it!

, You can tell an amazing amount about what a girl is feeling or thinking by reading her body language. You could even argue that body language is more important that what someone actually says, because it shows their level of comfort and interest. This is why if you are ready to take her hand, you should test the waters first and try to pick up cues about whether she wants to hold hands. Some examples of positive and receptive body language include:


Smiling
Leaning towards you as opposed to away from you
Having her face, torso and feet pointed at you
Mirroring your gestures or expressions
Seeming relaxed as opposed to stiff , Does she seem to mind you getting closer? If she moves a little bit away as you move closer, she may not yet feel comfortable holding hands. However, you can tell that she is interested if she does not move away and if her torso and feet are pointed towards you as opposed to pointed away. If someone has their body pointed towards you while you are close together, it shows a level of comfort and trust. , In the course of conversation, see how your girlfriend reacts to your touch. If she says something funny, touch her shoulder and tell her how funny she is. If she is receptive to you getting close to her and doesn't try to create distance between both of you, then you'll know that it's a good time to ask her.

Take inventory on how these weaknesses have played a role in past disappointments.,

Make no exceptions for what you know in your heart you cannot handle forever. He deserves a woman who is willing and able to be compatible with his lifestyle.

, Be mysterious by learning when to speak and how to listen. Don't ramble on inappropriately, as if your good looks will make up for diarrhea of the mouth. Focus on what the other person is saying, instead of what impression you are giving. This is not about celebrating your awesomeness. It's about getting to know whether this person is right for you.

, Be aware of red flags or warning signs, but do not react solely on the insecurities of your own past experience. Make sure the problem doesn't stem from previous disappointments seeping back into your psyche.

, Don't highlight his faults. It will deteriorate the attraction and trust. You are not there to judge, criticize or complain. As you've learned in the previous exercise, you are also imperfect.

, Remain humble and thankful. Have mercy on your partner. Don't live in a world of ideals. Instead, live in a world of what is. Ask yourself, ""Can I be happy with him as he is right this moment and not who I hope he will be in the future?"" If the answer is yes, then you're good to go.

After you've given the verbal apology a try, use other methods if she still hasn't forgiven you.,
Write a letter of apology.,
Depending on the girl, try a public apology.,
Leave flowers, chocolates, or stuffed animals at her home or workplace.,
Write a song apologizing and post it on YouTube.,
Write a poem apologizing to her.",How to Apologize to Your Girlfriend2," Sometimes, you'll need to give her several apologies before she accepts that you're truly sorry. That's okay; the more thought and effort you put into your apology, the likelier she is to forgive you.

, Give it to her in a romantic way, such as hidden in a nice bouquet, or delivered personally by one of her best friends. The letter can say something like this:


Example: ""I know that a letter can't fully make up for what I did. I also know that a letter won't fully capture how I feel and what I have to say. What I do know is that I messed up. I can't imagine not being with you. You're who I dream of when I go to bed, and who I think of when I wake up in the morning. You're everything. Nothing I do now will make up for what I did, but I can tell you that I'll never make that mistake again. I promise from the very bottom of my heart.""


, Be careful, because some girls hate other people knowing all about their relationship. Use your discretion before a public apology. Consider this, too: she might feel like you are using public pressure to force her to forgive you, as in ""Oh, how could Sarah not take him back? Look how sweet he is to her!"" It might ultimately be better to keep these things between you as a couple.


Go for the straightforward public apology. Just go up to her when she's with a group of friends, have something prepared, and bare your heart. Look her deeply in the eyes when you apologise, and focus your attention solely on her.
If you're feeling really creative, try using a flash mob to apologize to her. Flash mobs require a lot of work and preparation, so be sure it will work if you do decide to pull it off.

, Girls love these three things. Be sure to write a short message to her; flowers and chocolates without a message apologizing again takes a lot of the emotion out of it. Remember, you want emotion!

, Songs about missing people, having wronged people, or just songs about guilt and shame would work too. Of course, any song that has significance to you as a couple would be nice. You could try changing some of the lyrics to fit the situation.


Alternately, make her a mix. A mix is a little less personal, but with the right care and thought, it can help you get your message across. Pick both songs you know she loves and songs you think she hasn't heard.

, Leave it for her, or record yourself saying it on her answering machine. Make it heartfelt and very emotional if you can, something like:

Society often tells us that men have to make the first move, so she may have really wanted to hold your hand this whole time! , If you feel assured of your relationship and your girlfriend has been giving off positive body language, you may not have to ask her to hold hands.


One way that you can do this is to move your hand closer to hers, which works best if you are sitting at a table. If she keeps her hand in the same spot or moves it closer to yours, then she probably wants to hold hands.
If she takes it off the table, then you should take that as a sign that she does not want to hold hands., You can also offer your hand to her. If you are walking together, hold your hand out to her to take. If you are sitting across from each other an a table, turn your hand over so it is palm-up.

You don't want to just start holding her hand and go silent on her! , As awesome as holding hands is, it can't go on forever.

Know that even though you asked her to hold hands, you don't have to ask her to stop.


If you are worried about being too abrupt, give her hand a little squeeze and then let go. This is a nice way of letting her know that you enjoyed it, but it's time to let go.
If you want, after you let go you can even say something like ""I love holding your hand"", or ""I've been wanting to do that for a long time"". This is a sweet thing to say and she'll love it!

Are you public about your relationship? Maybe she didn't want to hold hands because she felt it was the wrong moment for your relationship to go public.

If you feel comfortable having a conversation like that, choose another day to bring it up.
If you don't want to talk about it with her, take a minute to think about it yourself.

, It could be that your girlfriend was taken by surprise and said no before she could think about it. It also is possible that she wants to hold hands, but she wants to be the one in control who initiates it.

If this person is your partner or is someone that you are dating, feel free to touch them more intentionally.

, In all of your charming, be sure to pay attention to the signs. If they respond warmly to your flirtation and flirt back, then asking for sex makes sense.

Relax together with vanilla or lavender aromatherapy.,
Have sex more often.,
Understand the phases of love, and figure out which one you are in.Phase 1: Attraction.,
Learn to watch for changes in your biochemistry.",How to Affect the Biochemistry of Love," According to Dr. Barbara Frederickson, a prominent psychologist and researcher, eye contact with positive intentions can directly increase oxytocin and a sense of connection with the other person. Oxytocin is the fundamental Love chemical most closely associated with longer term bonding and commitment.Make a conscious effort to make eye contact with your partner throughout the day, even from across the room. When your eyes connect, smile or maybe even flirt by winking.;
, A good hug can instantly give a boost to oxytocin. , Exercise stimulates dopamine production.


Dopamine is associated with the ‘drunk on love’ feeling, infatuation, and blindness to the others flaws., Proteins found in meats and other founds are converted to the amino acid, tyrosine, which is the fundamental ingredient of dopamine.

, Both of these scents stimulate the production of endorphins.Endorphins are associated with pleasure, including the rush of sexual pleasure, and connect some sexual experiences with feelings of love., Sexual intercourse releases chemicals like oxytocin and vasopressin.


Vasopressin contributes to a sense of bonding for men., The neurotransmitter phenylethylamine causes anxiety and stomach burn. The hormone testosterone triggers sexual desire, which usually activates the senses in a particular order – vision, sound, smell and taste. Other symptoms include: increased pulse, dilating of pupils, salivation, erect penis and wet vagina.
Phase 2: Romantic Love. The brain, in particular its limbic system and a variety of its chemicals, gets more involved as the goal becomes reproducing with your partner. Dopamine causes extreme feelings, whereby you may both love and hate your romantic interest at the same time.
Phase 3: Attachment. The brain’s neocortex, responsible for rational thinking, creates a need for stability in the relationship. More pleasure hormones, such as endorphin, oxytocin (for women) and vasopressin (for men), are released during orgasms and exchanges of affection, and thereby linking sex with love.
Phase 4: Lasting Love. Oxytocin plays the major role in creating and maintaining a lasting bond between a couple. But it doesn't sustain itself automatically. If you aren't feeling connected, experiment with the steps above to try to rekindle the oxytocin and feelings of connection.

, All these chemicals running around in your brain are often triggered without your conscious thought, and you are left with making sense of them and how they affect your decision making. When you feel the sensations linked with these chemicals, look more closely at what is going on, what you want to have happen next and what you want longer term.

Inform her of what you’ll do during the date before you meet her.;
, Dinner and a movie does work, but it’s better to choose a cheap, fun activity such as taking a walk, cooking together, going bowling, or going to karaoke.

She may flip her hair, tilt her head, or even gently touch your wrist.

, During a positive point in the middle of the date, hint at going home. You can say something like, “We should go home after this and watch the new episode” during a point when you’ve connected over a show you have in common or would like to see.Doing it subtly means suggesting the date continue, not demanding it. Be respectful.

, After you suggest you go home together, either overtly or covertly, return to normal conversation. Instead of focusing on what happens later, show that you’re a mature, consistent person who will respect her boundaries. Continue on with the date.

, At the end of the date, break any uncertainty or tension by asking her directly if she’d like to continue the date. Think of what subject you discussed that served as a means of connection. You can say, “I had fun, do you want to come up and watch YouTube videos?” or, “I’d love to see pictures, do you have time?” You may also try admitting you don’t want the date to end.If she seems tense, unless it’s in regards to how to end the date, it’s better to avoid asking. Try to build the connection more if you have a second date.
If she refuses, let her go. Don’t pressure her.

, Bringing her home, as well as any touching during the date, should only be done with consent. When you initiate contact in public, do it in a way you’d do with any acquaintance, including gentle touches on the wrist when making a point or guiding by the hand or shoulder during an activity.

, It’s important to make her feel comfortable. Keep your conversations and contact friendly during the date. When in private, be sure to move slow, starting with touches on the hand and low on her thigh. Any touch, including kissing, should be stopped if she pulls away or otherwise seems uncomfortable.Reassure her that you won’t do anything she doesn’t want you to do.

, Part of respecting her wishes is to restrain yourself verbally as well as physically. While flirting is acceptable, it usually is not appropriate to be lewd. Leave those jokes at home. In addition, her impression of you extends to how you treat people around you. Be as complementary and charming to everyone else as you are to her.Being polite and respectful involves not talking badly about past relationship partners, too. It’s often better to avoid this subject entirely and focus on your current date partner.

, In the event that the date doesn’t end the way you want, keep your calm. She is under no obligation to go home with you or even see you again. If she isn’t ready to go home, respect her wishes. Greet her goodnight even if you don’t kiss. This way, you’ll maintain any trust in case you do meet again."

Clean your room.,
Freshen up!,
Dress up your bed!,
Take the faux flowers and rip or cut off the petals.,If you have any extra rose petals, place them on the floor creating a path to the bed

,
Turn out those lights!,
Let there be light!,
Wine and dine.,
Choose your beverage.",How to Transform Your Dorm Room Into a Romantic Date," Before you can transform your room into a love oasis, you must make sure it is clean. Make up your bed. Clear off your desk (you will be using it).

Avoid leaving smelly laundry in your room. Nothing ruins the mood more than the fresh smell of gym socks and dirty underwear. Dorm rooms are normally shared with one or two other people the amount of space is limited. Having a clean room alleviates clutter and makes a room look slightly larger.



 

;
, Use your air freshener to freshen up the scent of the room. If there is a scent that your date loves to smell on you, lightly spray the scent on your bed. If your bed smells pleasant it will help create a good experience if your date decides to get in it.

, Take the white sheet and cover your bed with it. Make your bed mimic a massage table. If you do not have a white sheet you may use any sheet with a solid dark color. The dark sheets are also easier to hide spots with.

, Once the petals are removed, sprinkle them across your bed. There are many benefits to using faux rose petals instead of fresh rose petals.

Faux roses are cheaper than fresh roses, saving you money. They don't wilt, so you may reuse them. .







,, If it is nighttime, use the darkness to your advantage and break out those flame-less candles. If this is a daytime date, you can buy dark curtains or use a dark colored sheet.

Use thumb tacks to pin the sheet to the window. Since the tacks make such small holes, your R.A. (resident assistant) will never notice the holes when you take the sheet down.
The darker it is, the less likely it is for your date to notice your roommates messy bed, or any areas you didn't clean. The dark is an unorganized person's best friend.







, Now that the lights are out, it's time to spark the mood. Many romantic scenes feature candlelight. However, since many college campuses do not permit flammable candles, use flame-less candles to set the mood. Place the candles in multiple areas such as the desk, dresser, and on top of other furniture. If you have enough you may also place them in safe areas on the floor leading to your bed.

, The mood is almost set; now add the extras. In order to complete the night and have your date melting in your arms, you may consider providing dinner.


Have food available. Here are a few budget friendly ideas for meals:

Order you and your date's favorite takeout. Takeout alleviates the stress of trying to cook the meal yourself. This way you can spend less time cooking and more time romancing.


Cook your date's favorite microwavable food. Such as:

Ramen noodles
Easy mac
Hot pockets
These are fun ideas that your date may get a laugh out of. It is also cost efficient and time efficient. Plus, if you only have access to a microwave, this will be easy to pull off.


Sweets and treats. Have sweet treats available.






What's your date's favorite dessert? You may consider making it.

If you have access to a kitchen, you may bake small cupcakes that you two can feed to each other.
You may also make chocolate strawberries.

They are small enough to feed to each other, they can be made at home, and homemade desserts are often less expensive than store bought desserts.


If you and your date are sexually adventurous you may consider melting chocolate and being each other's dessert.



, Many dorms do not permit the presence of alcohol in dorms. If your dorm does permit alcohol consumption and you are within the legal drinking age or older, you may buy a cheap wine or champagne.

If a non-alcoholic beverage is necessary, you may use a sparkling white or red grape juice to mimic champagne or wine. Sparkling grape juice is also cheaper than alcohol, which will help you save money. Serve your beverage in the wine/ champagne glasses that you bought. Have the glasses cleaned and on display near the food.

Think about what you want in a potential partner.,
Take care of yourself before looking for other people.,
Develop a strong network of friends.,
Learn to flirt.,
Sign up for an online dating profile.,
Give your number out first.,
Ask someone on a date.,
Set a specific time and place for the date.",How to Start Dating1," Everyone has different preferences for romantic partners. You should think beyond physical attributes about what personalities you enjoy, what you need in a partner, and what you want out of dating. That said, there is no need to be super picky -- just give yourself some guidelines.For example, you might ask:


What kind attributes do I look for in my friends (funny, serious, creative, etc.)?
Do I want a serious relationship or to casually meet new men/women?
What are the ""deal-breakers"" that I absolutely do not want in a relationship?;
, Many people want to find a partner who will ""solve all of their problems,"" but unfortunately such a knight-in-shining-armor rarely exists in real life. By having self-confidence, taking care of your body with diet and exercise, and looking presentable you signal to people that you are ready to meet a partner and are capable of having a relationship.Remember that you are not trying to trick someone into liking you. If the feeling is not mutual than that person is not worth your time.Keep yourself clean and hygienic. This is one of the most obvious reasons someone would turn down a date with you.

, Having a solid social life not only helps you find people to date, it gives you a chance to go out into social settings without being alone. A strong group of friends will support you when dates go wrong and help you navigate the world of relationships as you start dating.


Building a social network exposes you to many new people and personalities that can help you find dates.
Ask your friends if they know anyone who might be interested in a casual date.
Friends can often make the best romantic partners, when done correctly.

, Flirting is often viewed as a secret art form, but in reality it is pretty easy. Study after study has shown that eye contact and smiling is the single most effective flirting technique around, so be happy and respectful and connections will follow.Flirting is great way to try ""pre-dating."" Smile, make eye-contact, and have casual conversations to see if you want to see someone more often or start dating. If you think they might be a good match, slowly ramp up your flirting to show your interest by:


Breaking the touch barrier -- touch a shoulder or knee lean in for a hug, or brush something off their clothes.
Teasing-- light teasing, like making a joke about their drink choice or taste in a movie, is one of the oldest techniques in the book. If they tease back then you've made a connection.
Asking questions. Genuine interest in someone is not only flattering, it lets you find out more about them and if they are a good match for you.

, These sites help you find compatible dates in your area easily and safely, and are a great way to start dating. When things go well, you've made a great new connection. But if you two aren't a match then you will likely never see each other again and you can move on to other dates without feeling awkward.


If you are chatting with someone online for more than 1-2 days it is time to pony up and ask them on a date., Make the first move and hand someone your number instead of asking for theirs. This shows that you have confidence and puts the ball in their court. If they are interested they will either call you or give your their number in return.


Don't always expect someone to give you their number in return. If they are interested they will get in touch, and this is a great sign that there is chemistry between you two., This is the simplest, but hardest, step to start dating. If you never ask someone out then you will never start dating. Remember, however, that dating is supposed to be casual. So keep it casual! You do not need to profess your love and ask someone to a romantic dinner. Simply ask them if they want to come grab a drink or some food with you and see what happens.


Just because it is ""normal"" for a guy to ask out a girl doesn't mean it is the only way to do things. No matter who you are, make the first move and ask.
Try lines like, ""I've loved talking to you, would you want to grab coffee sometime?""
Be receptive when people ask you out. It takes a lot of courage to ask someone out. Unless you know fully well that you would never date someone, a casual date won't hurt you.

, If someone is interested, schedule a time to meet and exchange numbers. Don't wait for them to suggest something, or make your move without having specifics ready. If they say yes, suggest a time or location and figure out when the best time is to meet.


Give them one or two options so that they don't feel like you're forcing anything.
For example: ""That's great, are you free Saturday or Sunday morning around 11?""

Be ready for surprises.",How to Abstain from Sex With Your Long Term Boyfriend6," Engage in erotic repartee. Exchange compliments and praise. Verbalize your feelings, thoughts, desires, dreams and interests.

, Hug your partner often and touch them gently. Smell and look nice for each other. Wear the outfits they tend to favor. Enjoy delicious beverages and meals together.

, Hold hands, stroke hair, rub feet, neck, and shoulders. Laugh together.

, Literally! Choose activities that get your blood pumping like hiking, biking, walking, running, swimming and wrestling!

, Spend time in your community, with your friends and family, and maybe even volunteer. Travel together. Hang out at coffee shops and wine bars instead of at home on the sofa.

, Our sexuality runs deep, sometimes deeper than we know. It okay to be frustrated, to hit walls, and to have to regroup.


Remember what your reasons and goals are, and remove yourself from situations that pressure you one way or another (that includes friends and family).
Include your partner in these moments. Repeat as necessary.

Shave if you want a clean-shaven look.,
If you have a beard (recommended only allowed if you have rich facial hair, as you don't want to look like a 15-year-old boy), wash it and trim it with extra care.,
Take a relaxing, refreshing shower one or two hours before the date.,
Brush your teeth with particular care (it should take at least 2-3 minutes).

,
Apply an antiperspirant.

,
Put on cologne.,
Get dressed.",How to Ace a Date1," Shave first with the grain, applying a generous amount of lotion. Then, with very, very light strokes shave against the grain to achieve a close shave. Apply a neutral-smelling, cool aftershave.;
, Shave several hours before your date, as you skin may temporarily feel irritated and itchy.

, Wash your hair. Be impeccably clean. This is absolutely vital, as no woman ever feels drawn to a grizzly bear. Pay particular attention to details: nails, ears, nose, etc... Use gentle shampoo and soap, with a light, fruity and fresh scent. Don't use strongly scented products - you will use a more virile cologne later.

,,, Apply it behind the ears, on the wrists and on the chest. Use no more than 4-5 squirts. Opt for classics such as Eau Sauvage, Hugo Boss Bottled, Le Male, or choose warm, rich, woody and sensual scents. Opt for citrusy, fresh scents only if the weather is very hot. Avoid sporty fragrances.

, Rely on classics, and make sure your clothes are fitting, well-ironed and clean (very clean). Here are some proposed outfits: autumn and spring: sleek brown brogues, slim beige chinos, white shirt tucked in, a colored scarf, trench coat; winter: sleek Chelsea black boots, black trousers, shirt and jumper (sober color), dark scarf, pea-coat, leather gloves; summer: loafers, slim dark blue chinos, un-tucked light shirt or T-shirt. You got the message. Avoid excessively formal attire, and instead go for smart and casual outfits. Always have a spark of color when wearing coats. A scarf is the best solution.

Be open-minded.,
Make your first date low-key.,
Know that dates are a way to get to know someone, not a test to impress them.,
Focus on making conversation during dates.,
Make a move near the end of the date if you feel a mutual connection.,
Set up another date if things went well.",How to Start Dating2," If you've already decided that they are going to hate you, chances are good that you will feel awkward, anti-social, and down during the date. Whether you know it or not, your date will pick up on this. Similarly, if you already decide you don't like someone, you'll spend the whole date looking for faults and issues with them. Dating is supposed to be fun and casual, so go into each date with your expectations cleared and your head held high.

, Bring them to somewhere they like or feel comfortable. Mildly crowded restaurants, outdoor events, or small get-togethers are often the best places to go because neither party feels awkward pressure to be romantic or perfect. You will have plenty of time to be romantic. For now, focus on being yourself and having fun.

, Both parties on a date are trying to find out if they would be compatible together. Finding out if you're a good match with someone is hard enough, but it is near impossible if you spend all your time trying to make someone like you. What's more, putting on a show gives a false impression of you to your date, which will come back to bite you when your act falls apart later in the relationship.


While it seems obvious, be yourself. You want someone to like you because of who you are, not who you pretend to be., Good face-to-face conversation is still the best way to get to know someone. Luckily, conversation is something almost anyone can excel at. You don't need a list of topics to have a good conversation, just a willingness to go with the flow and ask questions. Feel free to share things about yourself, but when in doubt about what to say you should ask questions about them. People love to talk about themselves and feel like someone is interested in them. Ask about work, their family, etc, but whatever you do, be genuine. What do you want to know about them? What made you interested in them?


The best questions are specific. Instead of ""What do you do at work?"" try ""What do you enjoy about your job?""
Don't make your date all about you. If you spend the entire date talking about how great you are, chances are good this will be the last date you go on with them.
Avoid controversial topics like religion and politics on your first date. These topics are often incendiary if you don't know the person well enough to be respectful.

, While this seems tough to determine, the signals are actually pretty obvious. If your date leans in frequently, makes a lot of physical contact (shoulder touching, linking arms, etc.), holds long, strong eye contact, and smiles in your direction, they likely are into you. Start slow, perhaps by giving a compliment or moving in close to their face, and see how they react. If they don't pull away it might be time to go in for a kiss.


If you are not interested in continuing to see someone, then politely say goodnight and go home. Do not feel like you need to kiss them or reciprocate feelings you don't share.

, Casually mention that you'd like to see them again sometime. While you don't have to make plans on the spot, as it can seem a little clingy, say that you'll be in touch and would like to go for drinks. If they smile and agree, then you should try and organize another date in the next 1-3 days.


Ignore things like ""the 3-day rule"" and just be yourself. If you feel a connection, pursue it whenever feels comfortable."
"
Remember that a date is not a commitment.,
Schedule more dates if things go well.,
Take your relationship slowly to start out.,
Build trust over time.,
Be exclusive.,
Communicate your expectations for the relationship.,
Remember to set boundaries.",How to Start Dating3," When you first start dating, it is natural to think that you need to go on 5-6 dates with someone you ask out. But if you do not feel a connection with someone then you should feel free to move on. Dating is supposed to be a fun way to get to know someone better, it is not a commitment to marriage or a relationship. If you don't want to keep dating, be polite and honest and break things off quickly.


Never lie or ignore people you don't want to see, as this often creates more problems. Simply saying, ""I had a lot of fun the other night, but I think I'd like to stay friends,"" should be enough.

, You don't need to jump right into a relationship, but if you feel like you have a connection with someone then you should invite the person out again. If you're really into someone aim to go out for food, see a movie, go for a walk, or meet for coffee 1-2 times a week and see how things develop.


Again, remember to keep things casual to begin. Meeting your parents, for example, usually happens many months down the line in a relationship.

, The rush of love is hard to overcome, but both you and your partner will be thankful if you slow down the relationship and get to know each other naturally. Avoid making huge plans for the future together or seeing each other every single night. While intimacy is not a bad thing, rushing into a physical relationship can lead to hurt feelings and complications if both partners are not on the same page. While you might want to spend your entire life with someone after a date, take your time understand your feelings before launching head over heels.Respect their privacy and history -- you don't need to know all of their exes on the second date.
Spend nights at your own houses and avoid lots of early sleep-overs. You can always get serious later-- it is much harder to slow things down.

, If you really enjoy someone's company, you need to build a rapport that reaches beyond the latest Game of Thrones episode. Building trust requires a little vulnerability from both parties, but the reward is finding someone you can confide in and get truthful, helpful advice in return.


Building trust requires giving trust. Share a small secret, insecurity, or goal and see if they are willing to open up in the same way.
As you become more comfortable, you'll likely trust someone with more and more of your life. This is the foundation of a strong relationship.

, You cannot still be dating around if you want to solidify a relationship. While many people have no problem with going on 2-3 casual dates early on, you need to make a commitment to someone if you want them to make a commitment to you. If you find yourself going on 2-3 dates with the same person, it is time to cancel any other romantic plans and stop searching for new dates. If this doesn't sound appealing, then you should be honest with your partner about your needs., This is often a difficult conversation to start, but if you feel a connection they likely feel one too. After going on 3-5 dates, you need to sit down together and talk about where things are headed. Are you interested in a relationship, or do you want tot take things slowly and see how they develop. Talking now will prevent heartbreak later.

, No one like it when you stop hanging out with your friends the minute a new love interest comes into the fold. Keep spending time with your friends, working, and seeing your family. You shouldn't feel like you need to spend every waking moment with your new flame. Instead, set boundaries between you so that you are comfortable doing your own thing from time to time. They will appreciate this too.Don't feel bad if you have to turn down the occasional date.
Make time in your schedule for your old friends frequently -- they are the ones that will be there for you if something goes wrong.

Feel out the situation.",How to Kiss Someone You Love," The first kiss in any relationship often takes that relationship to the next level, so you want to make sure that you are ready before you make the first move. Maybe you are in a friendship with someone that you really care about and want to become more, or you are in a relationship and are ready to show your partner that you love him. Either way, you don't want to jump into something without thinking over the results.Maybe kissing someone isn't a big deal to you, but when you kiss someone you love, it's usually more than just a casual flirtation. In this case, you want to make sure you are at a point where your words can match your actions, meaning you are committed to the relationship, or the prospective relationship.
It could also be really sweet to tell your friend or partner that you love him along with your kiss. This really takes the relationship to the next level, but is very thoughtful and shows your partner that you care about him and are committed.
If you are interested in kissing a close friend, because you realize you are in love with him, just remember to think about the possible results of this action. You don't want to ruin your relationship or make your friend feel awkward, so feel out the friendship to see if it is an appropriate time.
They key to knowing if you are in love with someone may be that you are willing to take the risk in showing them, no matter the results.;
, Along with deciding if you are ready, you also want to figure out if the person you love is in a place where they want to kiss you too. Observe how he is acting around you to figure out if he shares the same feelings that you do.Is your love being especially flirty with you? Is he making romantic gestures to show you he really cares about you? Does he seem committed to the relationship? Is he spending more time with you than usual? Does he help you without being asked? These could all be signs that he's in love with you or at least feels strongly about you.
This step mainly helps prevent heartbreak in a relationship. Kissing someone you love who doesn't feel the same way about you can be embarrassing and also hurtful, so before you make a move you should feel confident that he would want to reciprocate.

, This doesn't mean physically, but before you kiss someone you love, you should know him emotionally, because this will amp up the kiss and make it more meaningful. Kissing someone you love is different than kissing someone during a hook-up -- you want it to be special and communicate strong feelings towards that person.


If you are not at a point yet where you know someone intimately, take time to get to know them. Maybe you fell in love with him because you saw how he interacted with others, but you haven't had the chance to know him personally. Taking this time to learn who he really is will help create a special kiss.

, One key to making a kiss special and magical is to kiss the person you love in an environment that you view as romantic. This doesn't have to be a stereotypical romantic scene, like on a horse-drawn carriage ride, but it can be something that feels sweet and magical to you. Think about some special spots that you have been to in your relationship or some spots that you think of as romantic. Plan to kiss your partner in one of these locations.Some romantic locations are at a park with a lake or pond, in a secluded corner of a restaurant, at the beach, under the stars, on the top of a building with a great view, etc.
Often times the best kisses are somewhere secluded and quiet, so the two of you aren't distracted. However, you can kiss your partner in a place a with a lot going on if you still feel that it would be meaningful.

, You can kiss a person anywhere, but to make it meaningful, it's helpful to plan a meaningful date to set the scene for the kiss. As previously mentioned, choose a romantic location and plan a date that you and your partner would both really enjoy. Maybe you don't find roses and candlelight romantic, but you both love sporting events. Whatever you think would be the most enjoyable date, plan your night around that.During your time together, there will need to be a time where it is appropriate to move closer to your love. If you are doing something where there's always a foot between the two of you, it may not be the best place to kiss. Plan a date where you can become close and intimate with your love.

, The most romantic times in a relationship can also be the most thoughtful, when you've planned a date or given someone a gift because it means a lot to them. Don't just go with a classic ""date night"" but do something fun and different. Take your love to the first place that you met, or the place you first realized you loved him or her.


For example, a couple may be really into books and so a romantic place to kiss would be in the secluded section of an old library. Or maybe they are really into the outdoors, so kissing in a canoe might be really sweet.
If you think your partner would enjoy a classic date night, then do that! There is no perfect formula for a good date, so just do whatever you think your date would most enjoy.

, One way to make your love eager and excited for the upcoming date is to leave little hints or reminders throughout the week. Text your love throughout the week saying that you are excited for your date, or send him or her sweet messages throughout the week with compliments or expressing your feelings towards your partner.

, Maybe you aren't much of a planner so a planned date and picked out location seems a bit mechanical to you. In that case, kiss that special someone at a moment that feels right to you. It doesn't always have to be a planned out, perfect date, so when you are with your love and you look at him or her, realizing you are in love, then make the move at that moment!

, Before you make the move to kiss your love, you'll want to look your best so that the kiss can be really special and meaningful. If you normally hang out with your partner in t-shirts and sweats, try a new style like throwing on a nice pair of pants or a skirt and fixing up your hair. This will likely make your love more attracted to you, which will make the kiss even more romantic and passionate.


Consider spritzing on a nice cologne or perfume so that your love will want to snuggle up even closer to you.

, Before you kiss someone you'll want to make sure your breath doesn't smell and that your lips aren't chapped. If you just ate a meal, chew some minty gum to freshen your breath, or if you have time, brush your teeth. You might also want to put on some chapstick if your lips are more chapped than usual., Now that you look the part you're ready to actually make the first move. On your date, or wherever you are, become more intimate with your love by inching closer to her. Consider sitting next to her and putting your arm around her or holding her hand.

, This is key to showing your partner that you love them and to making your kiss special. Eye contact can do so much, as people who know each other well can often communicate a lot of emotions just by staring into each other's eyes. Looking people in the eye is also a way to show someone you aren't just playing around and that they can trust you.

, Show your love how much you care about her or what she means to you by expressing your feelings in sweet words to her. Tell her how you feel about her or compliment her on qualities you really admire in her. This will stir up both of your affections, making the kiss sweeter and more intimate.

, First, look your love in the eyes. Then, you can tenderly stroke her face or move her hair behind her ears. Now, go in for the kiss. Slowly move your face towards hers, coming so close that your lips almost touch but not quite -- this will build suspense. Then, tenderly kiss her lips.

, After you have made the first move and kissed your love, wait a few seconds to see how she responds. She may be really into it and start kissing you back, or maybe she is apprehensive. Either way, after you've made the first kiss let her make the next move.If this isn't the first time you have kissed your love, try increasing intimacy levels. Instead of going straight in for the kiss, begin by kissing her cheeks and her brow. These are tender kisses that will likely get her blood flowing.
You may want to avoid using tongue on the first kiss to make sure your love is into it. Once you know your love wants to kiss you back, then you can proceed to french kissing.

Gently kiss around the piercing.,
Communicate with the person you're kissing.,
Get creative with kissing.",How to Kiss Someone With Piercings1," While it may be tempting to kiss your partner roughly, this is a bad idea if they have a piercing. Make sure to be gentle around the area that's pierced because you could hurt them. Gently kiss the person around the piercing at first and test their level of comfort before kissing them more aggressively.


New piercings are especially sensitive.If a piercing is new, tugging or excessive movement could make it more prone to infection.;
, Everyone is different, and some people are more sensitive than others around their piercing. Talk with the person that you are kissing and ask them if it hurts or if it's uncomfortable. If you can see the visible discomfort in their face, stop kissing altogether or be much more gentle.


People that have had piercings for a long time may feel no pain when you tug, and may actually find it to be sensual.
You can say something like ""Hey, does this hurt? Do you want me to kiss you softer?""

, While having a piercing means that you have to think of additional factors, it also opens the door to a world of new possibilities. Tongue piercings, for example, are said to enhance sexual pleasure.Think of new and fun ways to explore kissing with your piercing.


Studs can create a pleasurable sensation when they make contact with skin.

Know where you two will go.,
Choose a place where you can talk - forget movies, opera, concerts, cabarets.",How to Ace a Date2," Come up with ideas, and show her you are in control of everything. Don't say, ""So, where do you want to go...?"" If she doesn't know what to order, make suggestions.

, The music should be soft and relaxing, and the surroundings reassuring, comfortable, and romantic. A place where you can dance is a also an option if you feel confident enough. A nice view is also a plus; it show you have sensitivity. Stay clear of dubious bars and noisy pubs with hard benches and drunk people swearing, or places with sexually explicit pictures hanging on the walls.

Smile, be fun (but never dirty) and be self-ironic.,
Lean toward her, and keep eye contact.,
Be polite throughout.,
Be confident and assured, but never brag (unless it's part of a funny story to make her laugh).

,
If she seems receptive by the end of the date, draw yourself close to her, take a hand or put your arm around her shoulders or waist, look her in the eyes for a few seconds and kiss her.,
Propose to see her home, especially if it is dark outside.,
Be careful; you are not dating a toy or an object.",How to Ace a Date3," Use elevated language, engage willingly in academic debates if she starts one. If not, better not ask her what opinion is of Celine or Kundera's work, or about the French New Wave. Ask her plenty of questions and listen carefully. When asked, answer amply, not monosyllabic-ally.

, Get near her smoothly and gradually, and occasionally softly touch her hand or shoulder.

, Come across as the perfect gentleman.

,, First kiss her lightly on her cheek, ear or eye, before proceeding to kiss her on the mouth. The kiss should last up to 40 seconds.

, As you part, kiss her again, and say how special she is to you. This is a proper love declaration, so be honest but also romantic, full of ardor.

, If you see your date only as a possible sex partner, drop it. Always respect the woman in front of you, and empathize with her all the time. Would you like somebody to be nice, polite and adorable with you just to take you to bed (or get your money, or a position, or anything similar). This is not an article for macho hunters: there are too many of them already.

Make sure your breath is minty fresh and clean.,
Approach the kiss with confidence.,
Set the mood.,
Lean in and tilt your head slightly.,
Start slowly.,
Let yourself linger between kisses.,
Open your lips slightly.,
Consider the French Kiss.,
Be sensually aggressive.,
Try some necking.,
Keep your arms busy.,
Try a ten-second kiss.,
Do not let yourself be distracted by anything.",How to Kiss Passionately," Naturally you practice good oral hygiene, but if you have any doubts about your breath, take a breath mint shortly before the kiss. Make sure to finish the mint or gum before you lock lips.


Be careful, as some mints may leave a bad aftertaste and make your breath worse. Water is the best bet! Leaves you no aftertaste, and freshens your mouth and does not leave you thirsty.;
, Try to kiss their cheek so they turn their head your way. Once you've chosen the right moment to kiss someone, there's no turning back, especially if it's your first time kissing that particular person. Be decisive and confident. If the person doesn't want the kiss, he or she will let you know, but until then, act as though you're a pro.

, If you truly want your kiss to be passionate, you will need to set the right mood. That doesn’t mean that you have to throw rose petals everywhere and light a hundred candles, but you should be some place without many distractions--that way you can both focus on each other (and your passionate kiss).

, Leaning in signals that you want to kiss the person, and tilting your head prevents you crushing your nose against the other person's.

, Don't try to thrust your tongue into your partner's mouth right away. Simply press your lips against theirs. Close your eyes as you do to heighten the intimacy and to avoid looking at the pores on your partner's nose. Imagine your eyes are being controlled by a dimmer switch.

, Kiss your partner once, slowly, letting it last for a few seconds. Then slowly draw your lips away, keeping them close enough to your partner’s lips so that they are almost touching (but aren’t). This lingering will help build the passion, and will really capture your partner’s full attention (pfft, as if you didn’t have it already).

, Once the kiss is accepted, try opening your lips slightly. If the other person follows suit, try slightly varying the openness of your lips (both more and less open) throughout the kiss. You may wish to explore the person's lips and tongue a bit with the tip of your tongue. There are no rules; just try to make your motions smooth.


Keep in mind that there is a thin line between passionate kissing and a drool fest. In order to gauge how wet your kisses should be, kiss the back of your hand like you would if you were kissing your partner and opening your lips slightly. You should leave a slight amount of moisture that dries up in a few seconds. If you see more than this, or leave a big wet circle on your hand, you’ve overdone it--dial it back., As the kiss progresses, you may want to try French kissing, in which you insert your tongue lightly into your partner's mouth and let it dance with your partner's tongue.

, After you’ve been kissing for awhile, you should try getting a little more adventurous. In between kisses, gently bite your partner’s lower lip, letting your teeth graze their lip as you pull away. (Do not suck on their lip or bite too hard, unless they’re really into that).

, If things are going well, consider spicing it up a bit by moving your head down to kiss and lightly nibble your partner's neck.

, You seldom, maybe never, see a great kiss in which the participants just let their arms dangle at their sides. At the very least, embrace your partner and gently pull him or her towards you. You can also run your hands through your partner's hair; or caress his or her back, sides, or other parts of the body. Wrapping your arms around your partner can also be a big turn on!


Where you put your hands should be determined by the status of your relationship, your desires, and your partner's signals, whether spoken or communicated non-verbally.

, Some find that a kiss of at least ten seconds in duration will passionately bond two people more than a shorter kiss. Just hold the kiss for longer, regulating your breathing and keeping your eyes closed.

, Whether it's fireworks going off behind you (hint: that would be a great moment for a passionate kiss) or people walking by you at the airport (bittersweet, beautiful goodbye or epic reunion?) you should not let yourself become distracted. If you look around while kissing, your partner is probably going to feel a little rejected and the passion-o-meter will definitely drop. No matter what is happening, keep your focus on the kiss and on your partner and let nothing distract you - nothing should fascinate you more than the sensation of kissing.

Find the right place.,
Choose the correct words.,
Sit close to each other.,
Hold each others hands.,
Kiss but not so passionately.","How to Kiss when You're Shy, but Your Partner's Shier"," If the two of you are shy it is very unlikely for both of you to want to kiss in public; after all, kissing in front of others is not always a good idea. Find a place where you are both feeling very comfortable because it might also allow you to kiss contentedly. As long as it is calm and comfy, the place does not have to be one where candles are lit or flowers are scattered. That would be the first step in which both of your bashfulness would start wearing away.;
, When both of you are in a relaxed atmosphere you shouldn't stay silent. It is true that kissing does not require conversations but in your case it does. You should get your partner to become in deep need of that kiss and one way is by making a short conversation that describes to him/her how much you like and want him/her.

, Since both of you are shy, sitting would be a better idea than standing. Once you're seated, make eye contact. Eye contact is very difficult for those who are shy, but in this situation, it is very necessary. When you are both looking at each other's eyes you will notice how your partner's eyes will slowly look down and focus on your lips instead. Your partner will then get closer to you while you should remain where you were.

, Holding hands will make the need for the kiss increase and will encourage your partner to kiss you. None of you should feel shy holding hands since even three year olds can do it.

, Yes, you will both succeed on putting your timidity aside for awhile..but only for awhile. Your partner will get his face closer to yours and you should do the same. Your lips will obviously meet and by then you will start kissing, however, make the kiss only last for a short time and include only half of your feelings in it. After the kiss is over, your partner and you will be more excited to do it again which will make both of your timidity disappear making the kiss more passionate.

Make sure the person you intend to kiss is comfortable with it.,
After meeting lips with the person your kissing, keep your eyes closed until the kiss ends.,

If the other person bites you or vice versa, laugh lightly and continue the kiss like nothing happened.,
If you want to take a break for a few moments, then resume kissing, simply pull away and smile at the person you were kissing or lean into them and hug them or take their hand and go back for another kiss.

,
If you want to stop altogether but not break away, simply cuddle for a while.

",How to Kiss Like a Pro," You'd hate to be rejected, wouldn't you? Leaning in for that special moment, only for them to lean away and it be awkward between you. Lean in but keep your eyes open and your mouth slightly parted, but not gaping open like a tunnel. If the person you intend to kiss leans to meet your lips with theirs, then close your eyes and open your mouth a little wider.;
, If you want the kiss to turn into French kissing, press your tongue against their lips if they're closed or into their mouth if it's open. Once you're tongue is in their mouth, find their tongue and gently massage it with your own.

, Breathe heavily, but not like a dog, more like how you'd breathe if you ran for three or five minutes. A little hard, but not panting. Also, don't be afraid to moan a little bit, but not continuously or you'll sound like a tractor.

, If the massaging with tongue part gets monotonous, pull your lips together and twist your head so your lips are tilted the other way or something similar. If you want to stop kissing then, go for it. If you'd like to continue it, re-open your mouth and continue how you were kissing before.

Avoid hitting their teeth with your piercing.,
Talk to your partner about your comfort level.,
Be extra cautious if you both have piercings.",How to Kiss Someone With Piercings2," When you kiss someone, and you have a tongue piercing, snakebites, or a lip ring, it's important to be mindful of the other person's teeth. Piercings can chip teeth and cause oral damage for the other person. Be gentle when you are kissing someone and you have a piercing., Sensitivity levels with new piercings vary. If your partner is doing something that hurts you or that you find uncomfortable, have an honest conversation about kissing and tell them that they should be more gentle.


You can say something like ""I like kissing you, but my piercing is painful when you pull on it. Can you please be more gentle?""

, If you both have piercings, then it's important to be extra careful. Rings are more susceptible than studs to become interlocked.If you're able to, avoid hitting your piercings together to reduce the chance of them getting caught.

Wait for the piercing to heal before kissing.,
Wash your mouth out with antiseptic after kissing.,
Contact a doctor if your piercing tears.",How to Kiss Someone With Piercings3," If you kiss someone with a fresh piercing, you are introducing foreign bacteria into their body that could result in an infection. Wait until the piercing heals before even considering it.


Tongue piercings take 4 to 6 weeks to heal fully but vary from person to person.A lip piercing typically takes anywhere from 6 to 10 weeks to fully heal.Labret and Monroe piercings take 2 to 6 months to heal fully., Use an antiseptic mouthwash like Listerine, Orajel, or Biotene if you can't help but kiss someone. However, it's also important to note that you should stay away from overuse of mouthwash because it could result in an oral yeast infection.If your tongue or mouth begins to turn white, keep mouthwash usage to a minimum.You can ask your partner also to use an antiseptic mouthwash before kissing you to reduce the chance of infection.

, If your piercing becomes dislodged or tears because of rough kissing, then visit a doctor to avoid infection. Often the piercing will have to be removed and then re-pierced once it's fully healed. Effectively caring for a torn piercing will reduce the chances of more severe infections or complications in the future."

Don’t rush.,
Pull away slightly while kissing.,
Try softly biting or sucking on your partner's lower lip.,
Peck softly.,
Kiss at certain times of the day.",How to Kiss Passionately Without Tongue1," There is no rush! The great part about kissing is that you’re taking time away from the world to enjoy your partner. You don’t need to scramble into things like the world is about to end. In all honesty, you will probably find it to be much more romantic and rewarding if you take the time to explore each other than if you kiss super fast and chaotically. Try it.;
, This is a great technique for romantic kissing. As you are kissing normally, pull back just slightly and see how the other person responds. If they follow you then you can continue kissing, and potentially even push them forward very slightly back in the other direction. However, this maneuver works best if you create a slight separation between your lips. This manufactures of a moment of romance, with your lips only slightly apart and your bodies close together.

, This should be a natural position. While you are kissing your lips are generally slightly parted and you aren’t always meeting your partners lips directly head on. Aim for the lower lip and then before pulling away suck on it a little bit or give it a tiny bite. This will feel new and exciting for your partner and it also adds some sensation.

, Sometimes less is more. By pecking softly, you are setting the stage for more to come and it can also be very romantic if you pause on your partners face during one of the pecks and breathe out slowly that can add to the romance. , Greeting with a passionate kiss can be a nice surprise and lead into passionate kissing. The same goes for a good morning kiss or a goodbye kiss. Really there is never a bad time for a kiss, but these times can help punctuate a kiss and make it more passionate than it otherwise would have been. Try to think of romantic occasions to kiss your partner.

Kiss your partner’s eyes one by one.,
Kiss your partner’s earlobe or cheek.,
Kiss your partners neck and under their chin.,
Kiss everywhere!",How to Kiss Passionately Without Tongue2," Then go back to kissing their lips. This is romantic and passionate and if you pause slowly in between each kiss you’ll only add to the anticipation. This can help you to break up the monotony of kiss after kiss and it also leaves you free to explore and kiss other areas around that area. , Breathing into your partner’s ear can help make the earlobe kiss even more passionate. Don’t blow - a little breath will do the trick. You can even say their name softly for added emphasis, but make sure you say it quietly because everything is very amplified when you’re talking that close to their ear. You can kiss their cheek softly on the way back to their mouth if you want to. , Kissing the neck is a classic move, but there’s a reason for it. People really seem to enjoy this, and it’s a nice break from kissing the lips because it’s so close. Try biting or sucking on the skin around the neck lightly for extra emphasis – you don’t want to leave your partner with an embarrassing mark. You don’t need to use your tongue at all in this scenario though, that will probably end up looking messy and wet. , There really isn’t a bad place to kiss someone as long as they feel comfortable. It will just look like you are exploring their body and show your partner that you like all of them – even enough to kiss it. Kissing your wife’s stomach when she is expecting is a great example of this technique.

Try running your hands through your partners hair.,
Push your body into the other person.,
Put your hands on their hands, their hips, or their lower back.,
Caress their neck while you kiss.",How to Kiss Passionately Without Tongue3," Male or female, this is very romantic and passionate. If they have really long hair don’t follow it all the way down, obviously. After all, you’re stroking their hair – not brushing it. This technique works best if you keep your hands moving from their neck up to the back of their head. You can also explore other times of their head, tracing their ears with your finger or whatever else you think of.

, Slight nudges from your pelvis or chest while your kissing can be a huge turn on for the other person, and it also pushes you closer together. Don’t get too dramatic about it, just a slight pressure is enough to get the point across. This is something that you can do sitting down or standing up and it will have the same effect regardless. , You can use this hand position to pull them toward you, or to squeeze their hand, or to rub their lower back, or anything else you think of. There are a lot of options and each of these positions offer the opportunity for you to express your passion through small pressures and touches with your hands. Plus, it makes the kiss more of an embrace.

, The idea behind this is that you’re giving a mini neck massage while kissing. This will show that you really care about how your partner is feeling and adds another skin on skin component to a kiss. Don’t try for a deep tissue massage, just stick to light kneading. You can combine the caress with touching their hair. "

Let him see how much you liked kissing and cuddling with him.",How to Kiss and Cuddle With Your Boyfriend," If you're both on the couch, don't sit miles apart from your man unless you want him to feel lonely. If the Mississippi river could run right between you two without incident, then you have a problem. So, if you're sitting on the couch, move over so your bodies are almost touching. If his arm is around the back of the couch, then that's a big sign that he wants you to move into the crook of his arm.


If you're watching TV, then this makes it a bit easier. Your sneaky moves closer to your man won't be so obvious.;
, Once you're in the crook of his arm, make him see that you like feeling his touch and move closer to him, so your head is on his chest or even resting right below his neck. You can even look up at him and smile to let him know how much you like cuddling with him. Then he'll know that he can put his arm around you.


You can also reach down and hold his hand. Gently stroking his palm or fingers can send him the right message.

, If you're bored with just sitting and cuddling with your boyfriend while you're both facing forward, you can try the reclining cuddle. You can put your arms around your boyfriend's shoulders, moving away from his body until he gets the message and knows he should lie down. Then, you can move into the crook of his arm, still facing away from him while his arms around you.


Alternately, you can just lie on his stomach, facing him -- though this will lead to kissing ASAP. When you're that close to each other, a stolen kiss will be hard to resist.
Your bodies shouldn't be stacked on each other completely. Even if you're lying on top of your boyfriend, move your legs off to the side.

, In this classic cuddling move, you and your boyfriend should both be sitting up with your arms around each other, but your legs should be folded and turned toward your boyfriend, fitting right on his lap while his legs are positioned below you, on the ground.

, This is another classic cuddling spoon. To do this one, you should be curled up behind your man with your arms around him. You should both be lying down, on your sides, to pull this one off.

, This is the ultimate spooning position. Just lie on your side, facing away from your boyfriend, so that his chest is up against your back. Your bodies should both be in the ""C"" position, facing the same direction, as your boyfriend puts his arms around you. He can even rest his chin on your shoulders, bringing your faces closer together.

, You may think that cuddling will bring you closer to your boyfriend no matter what. While this is true most of the time, there are a few cuddling poses that can be so uncomfortable that they bring your cute intimacy session to a halt. Don't worry -- these common mistakes are made by cuddling amateurs and professionals alike. But if you know what to avoid, you'll be one step of the game. Here they are:


The dead arm. The dead arm is the #1 most objectionable cuddling move. This occurs when you're snuggling either when you're sitting up or lying down, with your boyfriend's arm trapped behind your back. This will quickly cut off his circulation -- and his need for romance.
The human knot. This cuddling no-no happens when you and your boyfriend are so entwined that it would take an hour just to find out where you've put your left leg or right hand. If you can't separate your body parts from your boyfriend's, then you have a problem.
The notorious face-to-face cuddle. Unless you're ready to kiss right away, you should avoid cuddling while you're facing your boyfriend head on.
The tight squeeze. Unless you want your boyfriend to literally take your breath away, you should avoid having him hold you so tightly that you're struggling to inhale. If this happens, just gently tell him to let go a little bit.

, Making eye contact is the first step to a successful kiss. Once you're been cuddling for a while, or even if you haven't and just feel like kissing, the first step is to make eye contact. Locking eyes will let your boyfriend see that you want to kiss and that you're thinking about his lips. Once you're facing each other and your arms are around each other, it's time to go in for a kiss.


You can even lick your lips a bit to soften them without being too obvious about it. That will bring even more attention to your mouth.

, Now, move closer to your boyfriend and put your hand on his cheek or face. Pull him toward you and continue to lock eyes as you get ready for the kiss.

, You shouldn't try to French kiss him right away. First, give him a soft, passionate kiss on the lips. Just lean in to kiss his lips, hold your lips there for a second, and then pull away while locking eyes.

, Once you're comfortable with soft, gentle kisses, you can start French kissing if you're comfortable with that. Move your tongue slowly into your boyfriend's mouth as he does the same. Then, you can move your tongue around his mouth in a slow, circular motion, or gently move your tongue up and down as you rest it on top of his.

, If you want to show affection for your boyfriend, you can kiss his neck, his ears, or even the side of his jaw. This will add a nice change of pace to your kissing session, and will make him want to kiss you even more.

, Just because you're kissing doesn't mean that you should drop your hands and do nothing but kiss. In fact, it means the opposite. You should keep your hands busy while you kiss, so that you and your boyfriend feel more intimate. You can also take breaks between kisses to cuddle. Here are some ways to keep touching your boyfriend while you cuddle:


Put your arms around his neck
Play with his hair
Put your hands on his chest
Sit on his lap and put your hands on his shoulders

, When you're done kissing and cuddling with your boyfriend, give him a big smile and a quick kiss to let him see how happy he makes you -- and how much you'd like to kiss him again. Stroke his hair, tell him you like him, or do something small to let him see how happy he makes you feel. Don't be too embarrassed to show him your true feelings.

This will also prevent your significant other from having to bend down a lot to get to your level.

Don't let it get in the way of private intimacy.",How to Kiss in Public," If you want to kiss your partner in public, you can. That doesn't mean you can let that kiss progress into a make out session. When going in for a public kiss, use some discretion.

Kissing in public is fine as long as you don't overdo it. Don't use any tongue, and don't put your hands under your partner's clothes. Anything more than a closed mouth kiss may start to make people uncomfortable.;
, Kissing in public isn't always acceptable. Even if you think no one is paying attention to you, it may not be a good time to start kissing.

For example, just because you're in a dark movie theater, doesn't mean it's okay to start making out. You may be able to get away with a quick kiss on the cheek, but don't push it because you think no one can see you.Avoid kissing in places with large crowds, such as restaurants or grocery stores. An exception to this rule is nightclubs. It's common to see people kissing and dancing at nightclubs. If you're out and you feel like kissing, you're probably in the clear., In some countries, kissing in public is a serious offense. In most Western countries if someone disapproves of your kiss, you should only have to worry about a dirty look or two. But, in places such as India, kissing in public could land you in a lot of trouble.

If you plan on traveling with your partner, research some of the customs before you leave. Look for laws regarding all types of public affection. Don't limit your research to just kissing. For example, in China, holding hands is also prohibited between couples., No matter where you are, respect other people's boundaries. Don't force a kiss on someone who does not want to kiss you. Nobody appreciates unwelcome physical advances.


Don't use public affection as an ego boost. Kissing in public should be about sharing a kiss with someone you enjoy spending time with. Don't use it as a way to communicate to the rest of the world that your partner is ""taken."", If your partner pulls away when you try to kiss in public, ask them about it. Be sensitive to their feelings, and respect their opinion. Don't make them feel like they have to kiss you in public.

Just because your partner doesn't want to kiss you in public does not mean they are ashamed of you. It could be something as simple as not wanting to kiss in a certain location. For example, they may not want to kiss close to where they work, or in front of their friends., There could be any number of reasons why your partner doesn't want to kiss in public. Some reasons could be difficult to talk about. Maybe they didn't get a lot of affection in previous relationships, or maybe they feel that it's a private matter.

When they finish speaking, reply with, ""I understand why you feel this way."" Then, let your partner know your side of the issue. Don't negate their feelings, but try to find out the underlying reasons of the problem., Ask what your partner is comfortable doing in public. Assure them that you aren't trying to make out with them in the middle of a large crowd.

If you reach a compromise and you both decide it's okay to hold hands, and kiss on the cheek, respect those boundaries. Don't break your partner's trust by doing anything more than what they're comfortable doing., When you're alone, let loose. Don't let the issue of public affection get in the way of actually engaging each other.

In the privacy of your home, you should feel comfortable being affectionate. Tickle each other. Wrestle around and kiss. Keep things playful. After a while, some of that affection may spill out into the outside world."

Pick the stranger carefully.,
Show a genuine interest in the person you’re trying to kiss.,
Try starting a conversation about something in the immediate vicinity.,
Suggest a game.",How to Kiss a Stranger1," Pay attention to things like body language and how the person is behaving, especially whether they're interacting with the people around them. If they're alone, and looking around the room interestingly, then they might be looking for someone to talk to. However, they might also be looking for a person they're planning on meeting there. Try to notice whether they're just being observant or whether they seem to be searching for something in particular, for example, they might be craning their neck to get a good look at something that's difficult for them to see. If they're with a group of friends, and seem to be enjoying themselves already, they probably won't welcome an intrusion.;
, It’s generally better to avoid pick-up lines and not try to impress them with your ability to come up with a good one. While there are occasional situations in which these can be effective, it's generally a safer bet to try some of the ideas below to open the possibility of a kiss:


I couldn’t help but notice _________. Insert something you've noticed about them that's drawn your attention. Pick something that's a choice that they've made, not something they can't help like the shape of their eyes. For example, an item of clothing, a hairstyle, something you overheard them say (nothing personal!), or something they look interested in are all good options.
Is this seat taken?
Hi, How are you, my name is…
Are you waiting for someone?

, If you’re in a bar or restaurant that you often go to, ask whether he/she is a fan of some category of food or drink that they serve (for example red wine, a variety of beer, or any kind of food such as nachos, or fried meat). If the person says yes, then recommend something to them, making sure to point out what’s so great about it. If the person says they don't like it, you can either try to convince them that they should try it, or ask what they do like, and try to find some common ground, or a discussion point. Make sure to pay attention to what he/she is saying about what they do or don’t like and respond appropriately.


If you’re in a new place, ask if the person goes there a lot, and whether they have any recommendations. If they say they haven’t been there before, you can still ask their advice about what they think is likely to be good.

, You can go up to just about anyone and ask them if they want to play a game, and then suggest a game or bet with stakes that involves them kissing you if something specific happens. This is a great technique because it gives the other person the option to say that they aren’t interested without having to give a direct yes or no to a question as blunt as: ""Can I kiss you?"" It also preserves the feeling that perhaps they didn’t choose to kiss you, and only ended up doing it because they lost the game. Warning! Even if you win the game, if the other person declines to kiss you, you should not try to kiss them anyway - that would be harassment. A couple examples of some good games are:


Any sort of bet. Notice something going on around you, and say something like: ""I'll bet you a kiss that ____________.""
A card trick where you have to find the card that the person you want to kiss chose. Before you start, agree on the stakes: if you succeed, they have to kiss you (you can even set parameters about what kind of kiss it has to be). If you fail, then offer them something else in return. A drink, offering to take them out to a meal, or some amount of cash are all good options.
Something like spin the bottle. This is especially good if you really want the person you kiss to be a complete stranger - you can call in friends to put together the group, and then you will never have spoken to some of the people you might then kiss!
Truth or Dare. Even if the other person consistently picks truth, you can always tell them the truth that you want to kiss them and see how they react!

The trade-off kiss.,
The flavor kiss.,
The drink kiss.,
The cold kiss.,
The Pop Rocks kiss.",How to Kiss in a Variety of Ways1," This is a fun and advanced kiss that you should try with someone you are comfortable kissing. During this kiss, one person should suck on a cinnamon candy and the other person should suck on a mint. Begin to French kiss. Slowly switch the mints and the candy in your mouths.

Switch the mint and the candy back and forth until you need to come up for air or until they have dissolved.



 


You can do the trade-off kiss with any small candies or mints, but be careful not to choke on them.






If you're nervous, start the kiss by practicing trading just one item between your mouths to get the hang of it.





;
, First, put a piece of long-lasting gum in your mouth just before you and your partner French kiss. While you're kissing, pass the gum back and forth, and see how long it takes for the flavor to run out!


Choose a gum with a sexy flavor, like strawberry or winter mint.

, Take a sip of your favorite drink, which could be either something alcoholic or sweet. Begin to kiss your partner, and when your lips meet, pour the drink into your partner's mouth. Take a very small sip of the drink to avoid spilling it.


Your first attempt should be with a clear substance so you don't end up spilling it everywhere.

, Take a few sips of an ice-cold drink or chew on an ice cube until your mouth is freezing. Then, kiss your partner and graze your tongues. You will feel a sexy chill if you do it right.

, Pour a little bit of Pop Rocks into your partner's mouth and then begin to French kiss him.


Both of you will feel a playful tingle in your mouths.

Have the taller one sit on a stool.,
Sit on the couch.,
Sit on the taller person’s lap.,
Find a staircase.",How to Kiss a Taller Person2," To bring the other person down to your level, have them sit on a bar-style stool. This will bring them closer to your height without making you have to bend over. Sitting in a chair may make them too short, but depending on the height difference, this could work better for you., Having both of you sit on the couch may be one of the easiest ways to overcome the height difference. If you are still much shorter than them, fold your legs under you to give you a little boost. Move closer to your significant other and give them a kiss.

, If you both are comfortable with it, sit in the taller one’s lap. This will naturally elevate you and bring your face closer to their face. You can do this at home or wherever you feel comfortable with public displays of affection.

, Stand on the taller stair to give you a height boost. This is a great and convenient way to become closer to each other’s level. Lean in and wrap your arms around them to show your affection.

"
Wear heels or boots.,
Have them pick you up and hold you in their arms.,
Stand on your tiptoes or on their feet.",How to Kiss a Taller Person3," Break out your tallest pair of heels, boots, or platform shoes to get on more even footing. Be careful not to wear shoes that or too tall which could hamper your ability to balance or walk. A great pair of heeled shoes are both alluring and will overcome the difference of height., If your significant other is able to pick you, have them sweep you off your feet and hold you in their arms. This will naturally bring your faces close together, allowing you to both to kiss.

, Stand up on your tiptoes to give your significant other a kiss. They may have to stoop a bit to meet you in the middle, depending on their height. You could also try standing on their feet, as some people like that or don’t mind. Don’t do this if you’re wearing shoes and they are barefoot, as you might end up hurting them.

Start slow.,
Compliment them.,
Pay attention to body language.,
Don't make assumptions.,
Think before acting.,
Treat it like any first kiss.",How to Kiss a Stranger2," Flirt, and give them hints that you might like to do something more than talk. This will give them a chance to consider the possibility that you might be interested in kissing them, and to think about whether or not they’d like to kiss you. This might be a good time to break the touch barrier, and put a hand on their arm or shoulder to indicate physical interest. Consider asking them to dance if you are somewhere that dancing is appropriate, but make sure not to do anything that could be construed as overtly sexual - coming on too strong will scare most people away. Pay attention to how they respond to this touch: if they pull away, or act uncomfortable, chances are they aren’t interested.

, Try to stick to something that isn’t sexual in nature, and won't come off as creepy, or overly personal. Make sure to take the situation into account, and consider the gender (or gender identification) of the person you’re trying to compliment. While you won't know much about this person yet, compliments that aren't physical are usually more effective, so make use of anything that you've gleaned about them. This below list comprises suggestions, but not all will be applicable to everyone, so you should use discretion and your awareness of their body language to filter the suggestions.


I’d like to get to know you better.
I know we've just met, but you seem really talented / smart / caring / kind / funny.
You’re really interesting.
I think it's really interesting that _________, (Insert something you actually find interesting about them!)
You’re beautiful / gorgeous / good looking / strong.
You make me feel (really) excited / nervous / happy.
I love your eyes. (You can also say something like mouth, or face, but try not to get any more personal than that.)
It's really cool that you_____________. Can you tell me more about_____________. This can be especially effective if you make them feel special for the knowledge they have by adding something like, ""I've never met anyone who____________.""

, Men and women tend to use slightly different movements for expressing interest using body language, but some general signs that a person may be interested in physical contact with you are:


Leaning towards you rather than back.
Paying attention to you when you're talking. If their gaze wanders around the room frequently, it's probably a sign that they wish something else would happen to give them a way to stop talking to you.
Making eye contact. If a person is wiling to look into your face for an extended period of time, it's a good sign that they're interested in you.
Looking interested and engaged. It's usually pretty easy to tell if the person you're talking to is bored with the conversation. If they have been quiet, or look bored or uninterested, either change tactics and talk about something else (try offering them the chance to choose a topic of conversation by asking an open ended question), or look elsewhere for someone to kiss.

, Even if someone seems willing to kiss you, think about whether you have taken into account their body language, or whether you are relying on common assumptions and stereotypes. An example of an assumption you might make is that if someone is dressed in a revealing way, that they are asking for sexual attention. Remember that these assumptions on your part do not constitute consent on their part. When body language fails to tell you what you need to know, you can always just ask them if they’re interested in doing something with you.

, If you might want to start a lasting relationship with this person that is emotional as well as physical, consider that kissing them right off the bat might not be the best way of accomplishing this. Letting the physical tension escalate slowly as you get to know them better may be more effective at starting something that lasts. On the other hand, kissing soon after meeting can be a good way to tell whether there is any physical chemistry between you – something which can be good to establish before too much time has been invested!

, Just because you haven’t gotten to know this person very well yet, it doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t take the same precautions you would for a kiss at the end of a first date! Make sure that they’re interested in kissing you via body language and other signs, and make sure that your mouth is reasonably clean.

"

Follow up.,
Pay attention to boundaries.,
Never kiss anyone who you have any reason to suspect doesn’t want to be kissed by you.",How to Kiss a Stranger3," Just because you kissed someone doesn’t mean that they will assume you want to start a relationship with them. Shortly after the kiss is a good time to establish what you are hoping for. Depending on what you want you could say something like :


That was nice.
Can I see you again sometime soon?
Are you free to go out to a movie next Thursday?
Shall we get out of here?
Do you want to come back to my place?
I really enjoyed that. We should do it more often.

, This means both your boundaries and the boundaries of the person you want to kiss. Just because you initiated the kissing, doesn’t mean that you’re obligated to take it further if your partner indicates that they’re interested. Similarly, just because someone is willing to kiss you, or even enjoys kissing you, it doesn’t mean that they will want to take it further.

, Doing so would be an aggressive sexual advance. If you persist when the person you are trying to kiss has made it clear that he/she does not want to be kissed, then it becomes harassment,and can subject you to legal action.To know whether or not someone doesn’t want to be kissed, pay attention to their body language, and how they are interacting with you as well as any verbal cues. For more information on subtle cues that can let you know the person you want to kiss doesn’t want to be kissed, you can look at How to Know if a Girl Wants to be Kissed. This advice applies almost equally well to people of any gender.

The breath kiss.,
The underwater kiss.,
The vacuum kiss.",How to Kiss in a Variety of Ways2," This kiss creates major anticipation in an already-hot moment. First, you and your partner should part your lips slightly, and barely touch them. Begin to share your partner's breath. You can move your heads to experience different sensations, and touch your lips on and off slightly. This is a teasing kiss that will leave both of you wanting more and will make you feel very sexy.

Remember that hot breath is different from cool breath. Breathing from your throat will create hot breath, while blowing through your lips will create cool air.






Obviously, both partners should have fresh breath before they jump into this kiss.







, This can be tricky, but rewarding. First, your partner should hold his breath underwater. Next, he should pull you down. You should join him with lungs full of air. Gently begin to kiss him, and share your air with him.

When you get this method down, switch and be the person who is underwater first.






Be careful with this one. You could end up choking on water. Start your kiss by parting your lips just a tiny bit.







, This is a playful kiss. Kiss your partner with an open mouth, and suck in so deeply that you're sucking away your partner's air.


Fresh breath is also a must for this one.

"
"
The chew kiss.,
The touch kiss.,
The suck kiss.,
The chin kiss.,
The nip kiss.",How to Kiss in a Variety of Ways3," This kiss is not for the faint of heart. First, your partner should put his tongue deeply in your mouth. Then you should gently bite the back of his tongue. For added effect, you could suck the tip of his tongue as well.


Take turns. After you've worked your way around your partner's tongue, put your tongue into his mouth and enjoy the kiss.

, This is a kiss for experienced French kissers. During this kiss, you and your partner should simply touch the tips of your tongues. Your tongues should be touching outside your mouths. Move your tongues around for more pleasure.


The touch kiss can feel great, but avoid offending the people around you. Kissing in public is one thing, but kissing with your tongues in the open takes it to a new level.

, This is a seductive type of kiss. Instead of a normal French kiss, suck on your partner's top or bottom lip while he is kissing you. You can suck for just one or two seconds and then switch between the bottom and top lip.

Switch and have your partner suck on your lips.






Don't try to suck on each other's lips at the same time. That will be too messy.







, Hold your partner's chin with your middle finger, index finger, and thumb. Tilt his head in the right direction. Continue to hold it as you kiss. Note that you can chin kiss any way you want. As long as you're supporting his chin, you can French kiss or add other elements to the kiss that involve your tongue and lips.

, This kiss needs to be carefully done, but if you do it right, your partner will feel amazing. First, bite your partner's lip very gently. Then be slightly more aggressive and try biting other parts of your partner's lips.


You should only try this one with someone you've kissed a lot, because not everyone is comfortable with biting.

The foot kiss.,
The forehead kiss.,
The Eskimo kiss.,
The cheek kiss.,
The butterfly kiss.",How to Kiss in a Variety of Ways4," The foot kiss is both an erotic and a romantic gesture. Before you begin, make sure you have your partner's consent, because some people are weird about their feet. Next, make sure your partner's feet are clean and ready to be kissed. Begin by gently sucking the toes and then lightly kissing the foot.

While you kiss your partner's foot, give her a gentle foot massage at the same time.






Lightly blow on your partner's toes.






Don't kiss your partner's feet if he wore sneakers or close-toed shoes all day because his feet could be sweaty and damp. The best time to do this is after he is freshly showered.






If you know that your partner plans on kissing your feet, keep your toenails neatly trimmed and manicured.







, This is not an erotic kiss, but is meant to show your affection, or even to say goodnight to your loved one. Simply brush your lips lightly on the crown of your loved one's head. You can even push your loved one's hair back for effect.

, This one is simple. Rub noses with your partner and don't forget to smile.

, This is a great way to greet your partner or to say goodbye. Just gently kiss your partner on his cheek.

, Move your face close to your partner's until your eyelashes are touching. Then, bat your eyelashes at the same time.

Get rid of the evidence.",How to Kiss a Neck," No one wants to kiss cracked, dry lips! The silkier the lips, the easier a time you'll have kissing. A quick lick will do in a pinch, but for the best kisses you should moisturize those lips. Keep yourself hydrated, and apply products like lip balm. Products like Burt's Bees, Carmex, or Bag Balm can get your lips smooth and silky.


A lip gloss can make your lips even juicer for kissing, if you like wearing that kind of thing.;
, Good breath with a sweet taste to your lips are important for any make out session. Neck kisses often result in your breath going straight to their face, so be prepared.

, Don't start the make out session at the neck. Start at the mouth and make your way there. This is much sexier (although, there's certainly something to be said for those sneaky-from-behind neck kisses). Trail kisses from mouth to neck for ultimate effect.

, When you kiss the neck and anything around it, aim for sensitive areas. The back of the neck, for example, is much more sensitive than the side of the neck (which is more commonly the source of focus). Ears, the corners of mouths, and the collar bone are good places to try.

, Not slow as in ""I'm not sure about this"" but slow as in ""I know exactly what I'm doing and you're going to beg me for it"". Enjoy each touch, each texture, each flavor as you move across their skin. This will have them...eager for more.

, You should vary between the lightest of kisses and firm, strong kiss. The variation is what makes the kiss (and make outs in general) more interesting and fun. You don't want to seem robotic!

, A little nibble or even a strong bite can be a huge turn-on for your partner. This is most effective on the side of the neck, rather than the front or back. Be careful though: this is an easy way to leave marks or a bruise, which may land your partner in hot water with family, school, or work.

, Then, of course, there's the classic sucking. This is most sensual if, like varying pressure, it is a quick suck and then release, perhaps interspersed with other techniques. Be careful though: this is an easy way to leave marks or a bruise, which may land your partner in hot water with family, school, or work.

, Whether a quick probe with the tongue or a long sensual lick from earlobe to collarbone, licking is an important part of a good neck kiss. This is also safer than biting or sucking, as it's not going to leave any marks!

, Changes in temperature trigger those sexy tingly nerves. Get such changes in temperature by lightly blowing over some skin you've just licked. A hot sensation can be created by nuzzling or by blowing out a big puff of air (like you're trying to see your breath). The cold is more effective than the hot, however, contrary to what you'd think.

, Moaning, whispered dirty talk, and sometimes even a growl can be a sexy sound for your partner to hear while you nibble. Don't be afraid to make a little sound!

, While you're kissing, you should be moving your hands to caress their chest, cup their face, grope their...erm...you get the idea. You don't want to seem like a dead fish. Show them just how alive you are by overloading their body with sensation.

, Some people enjoy an hour long neck-snog, but generally neck kissing should be a prelude to something else. You especially don't want to linger too long on the neck, as hickeys can really get your partner in a lot of trouble.

, Apply these techniques to a variety of places on your partner's body. All of the nerve endings that make neck kisses feel so good can also be found in other places, like the inner thigh or the wrist. Bonus: hickeys in these spots are way easier to hide!

, Just wander back to the neck every now and again, trailing kisses like we talked about. The variety is what makes for a great make out.

, If you're really going to insist on ignoring our hickey warnings, we can at least keep you prepared on what to do when you get one!

Walk your date to the door.,

Be able to recognize dismissive behavior.,

Lean in slowly.,
Make it special.,
Don’t overdo it.",How to Kiss Goodnight," At the end of the evening, escort your date to their place of departure, whether it be their front door, their car or the bus stop. Most first kisses happen right before you go your separate ways, so your first step is to put yourself into the proper setting to take advantage of the moment. If you don’t even manage to make it that far, there’s a much smaller chance that you’ll part with anything other than a friendly word.It’s best if the two of you are somewhere dark, quiet and private. That way, you can focus all of your attention on one another.;
, Move in close to your date by bridging the distance between the two of you. Try to stand about an arm’s length away, or closer if circumstances allow it. If they don’t pull away as you get closer, you’re on the right track. The cozier and more personal you and your date get, the more likely you are to share a smooch.Standing face-to-face almost guarantees the prospect of a kiss.
Don’t, however, hover unnecessarily close or violate their personal space. This will make you come across as more creepy than charming.

, Look your date square in the eye and smile warmly and flirtatiously. Making constant eye contact helps to form a connection between two people and opens channels for unspoken communication. If he or she steadily returns your gaze, there’s a good chance that they’d be receptive to a kiss.Keep an eye out for what’s known as the “lover's triangle”: glancing from one or both your eyes down to your lips and back. It’s a nearly foolproof clue that your date foresees a kiss in their future., Assuming that the two of you are still chatting and haven’t cut straight to staring into each other’s eyes, pay attention to frequent, pronounced lapses in your dialogue. It might mean that you both have something on the brain other than talking. Gaps in conversation often make a great cue for locking lips.The best time to act usually comes after either you or your date has said something along the lines of “I had a really great time tonight.”
When you’ve run out of things to talk about but you’re both still standing around expectantly, there’s a good chance your date is waiting on a kiss.

, Think back over the night. Was it enjoyable? Did the two of you have a lot to talk about? Does your date seem genuinely interested in you? Gauging the success of your date won’t tell you exactly when to throw yourself into a romantic embrace, but it can give you a good idea of how the other person will be feeling and whether or not a kiss would be appropriate way to end the evening.There’s no guarantee that just because your date had a good time they’ll be ready for a kiss just yet. Not everybody works at the same pace. Tune yourself in to their emotional state before you plan your next move.
Don’t hesitate if it feels right. Many people consider a goodnight kiss the perfect way to end a fabulous date.

, Take note of whether or not your date lingers before saying goodnight. If they immediately start fumbling for their house keys once you reach the front door, you can be fairly certain that they’re not interested in taking things any further. If they’re slow moving or seem reluctant to bring the night to a close, however, they might be hopeful for a heartfelt sendoff.Try to pick up on indications that your date is trying to put distance between the two of you emotionally, such as seeming overly quiet or disinterested, sighing or turning their back.

, Regardless of how you felt the night went, your date might be eager to get it over with. If he or she insists that you don’t need to walk them to their door, or keeps their distance once you’ve reached it, consider quitting while you’re ahead. Other red lights include closed off body language (turning away), unwillingness to meet your gaze, pursed lips and, worst of all, the dreaded handshake.Listen for brisk, conclusive phrases like “I’ll call/text you,” “I have to be up early in the morning” or simply “goodnight.” This kind of finality is typically reserved for when someone wants to put an end to things in a hurry.
A hug can go either way. If your date goes for a hug to be closer to you, and holds on for a long time, it could be taken as encouragement for the kiss. If it feels like more of a platonic gesture, however, try to take the hint.

, On the flipside, your date may clearly be putting off vibes that they’re into you. These can include facing you directly, parting their lips and giving you steady, suggestive glances (or eyeing you and then looking away bashfully). Actions like these are instinctively ingrained, and are about as obvious an invitation as you’re going to get.Some other promising signs to look for are rapid, shallow breathing, continued licking of the lips and a quick or pounding heartbeat.
Most of the time, your date will make it clear to you whether or not they want you to kiss them.

, Be ready to seize an opportunity for a kiss when one arises. This will require a bit of feeling out on your part, depending on the situation. For every goodnight kiss there is a unique “window” during which conditions are perfect. Try to assess your date’s attitude and body language and decide whether it’s an appropriate time.In some cases, it might be interpreted as rude to cut your date off with a kiss mid-sentence, while in other circumstances they might find it romantic. Use your best judgment before you commit.
A sudden, expectant pause in the conversation usually makes a perfect occasion to initiate a kiss.

, When you feel the time is right, move in. Make sure you’re standing close enough to your date for the kiss to happen naturally. Lean in slowly and make your intentions evident—this will give them time to prepare, or to pull back if it’s not what they want. That moment of anticipation before a first kiss is almost electric!You can either go straight for the lips, or pull back momentarily to heighten the anticipation before you finally seal the deal.
If she turns her head as you lean in, just apologize, laugh it off and leave with your dignity intact.

, Give them a kiss they’ll never forget. As you lean in, close your eyes and tilt your head. Part your lips and press them softly against your date’s, then kiss them more firmly. If you want, you can place a hand on their cheek, hip or small of their back and pull them in closer, or reach down to lace your fingers together.Keep your eyes closed until you disengage. It’s always weird to find the other person staring at your during a meaningful kiss.
Get a sense of when to end the kiss. Wait until the passion reaches its peak, then be the first to break away. Always leave them wanting more., A good first kiss is opportunistic, sensual and doesn’t overstay its welcome. Unless your date is particularly enthusiastic, don’t try to slip them the tongue, get grabby, breathe heavily or do anything else that they might find off-putting. Just enjoy the fireworks for a few moments, then tell them goodnight or await an invitation to come inside. Ah, love!Though your date may be sending you signals that they want to be kissed, that doesn’t mean they’re alright with being groped or manhandled. For the most part, you should keep your hands to yourself until you start getting the signals for that, too.
Getting too worked up during a kiss is a surefire way to ruin it, and potentially embarrass yourself.

During this time, occasionally hold his hand or move a little closer in order to build up the romance. Keep your movements slightly obvious, but stay casual so he doesn't start to get scared.


If you see your boyfriend start to shy away, this might be a sign that he is getting uncomfortable. You also could be moving things a little too fast. Upon seeing this, wait a little bit before approaching the move again.
If you see your boyfriend repeating the moves you’ve made, keep the conversation going and keep him comfortable as you build up to the kiss.;
, Physical contact is often the first barrier that needs to be broken in order to proceed to that first kiss. Once a little touching has happened between you two, the rest is written. Bring the two of you together in a physical way.Hold his hand while you’re enjoying time together, riding around in a car or walking to class. Lean on him while you hold his hand or while you’re having a meal together.
Hug him every chance you get to work your way up to kissing. Soon greeting each other as hugs will evolve to greeting each other with kisses.

, If he leans into you as well, he will most likely take the lead. Allow everything to flow normally after that, and don't back out. Touch his face or his hair to create a sweet intimate bridge in the air between you two.Use your hand on his face to gently tilt his face towards yours to pull him into you.
Take the next step and close your eyes to move in for the kiss.

, Give him soft kisses a few times, starting the kisses off to a slow, gentle start. Move the kiss up a level by transitioning into a lip lock. His top lip will be on top of yours and his bottom lips slightly above your bottom lip as you lock together.Continue to gently kiss and vary the movement slightly by sucking on his lower lip in a teasing way. If things get hotter as you kiss, encourage some tongue by running yours lightly over his lips. He’ll respond by opening his mouth slightly and your tongue will be able to stroke and massage his.
Put your hands on his shoulders or make things more passionate by pulling him close and framing his face in the palms of your hands as you kiss him. You can also put your hands in his hair to pull him into you even further.
If the heat proves too much for him too quickly and he pulls away instead of pressing himself closer, back things up a little and return to the soft, gentle kisses you initiated the kiss with.

, Sometimes the way to give a shy guy a little push is to let him know how much you like him. Let him know regularly that you like him, laugh at his jokes, smile when he’s around, make sure that he sees how much you genuinely enjoy him and his company.Shyness is directly related to a lack of confidence, so by instilling confidence in his position in your life by showing him that enjoy his company and that you value him in your life, he will be more likely to feel more confident with where he stands with you in the end.
If your guy isn’t good at picking up nonverbal cues, it might be necessary to actually say to him every once in a while that you like him. If he says something funny, laugh genuinely, and then end it by saying, “Wow, I really like you” with a smile.

, Send visual cues that you want to be kissed by taking special care of your lips. Full kissable lips can be very alluring to your boyfriend.Exfoliate your lips regularly by rubbing wet sugar against them in gentle circles. Keep them moisturized by applying a lip balm or gloss.
Avoid wearing lipstick in moments you want to kiss your man. Lipstick can be a great way to show off your lips, but sometimes makes guys afraid to kiss you in public because the lipstick will be on their lips. If you insist on wearing lipstick, try a nude lip or something matte, since it’s less likely to transfer during kissing.

, Eyes can be one of the most power indicators of attraction and desire. Look into his eyes to show how engaged you are in him and his conversation. He’ll want what you want in no time at all.When the two of you make eye contact, briefly bite your lip to bring attention to that area on your face, look at his mouth, and then return to his gaze.
A more subtle way to give the hint that you want to be kissed is just to smile flirtatiously while you maintain eye contact with him., While you’re talking to him, send a subliminal message that you’re thinking about kissing his lips by looking at his mouth as he talks to you. Make it a point to drop your stare from his eyes to his lips to exude longing.Smile with your eyes as you look from his eyes to his lips and then back repeatedly.
Build anticipation between you two for the big moment by making sure that he notices how longingly you’re looking at his mouth.

, Sometimes you can set the mood, give hints, and try to initiate things, but things still don’t pay off with a kiss. Sometimes the best move is to be direct and initiate your kiss by being straightforward with your boyfriend about what you want.


Express to him how much you have wanted to have a kiss from him. You can also ask him if he can kiss you if you prefer him to be the one who leads the kiss. Say something like, “I really like you and am ready to take things a step further by kissing you. I want to show you how you make me feel.”
If he doesn’t seem interested in fulfilling your needs, even when you express them plainly, you might have to consider how long you’re willing to be patient with his shyness. If you’ve reached your breaking point, break up with him and find someone who is dying to kiss you.

, Most men are visual creatures so one surefire way to get him into a romantic mood is dressing the part. They are wired to be turned on by visual cues, so start the night off right by wearing something that supports the mood you’re going for that night.Even if you’re dressing up for him, try to be as true to yourself as possible. If you’re not comfortable in sky-high heels or feel like going too formal feels contrived, go for something simple.
Dressing up for your man doesn’t necessarily mean you have to dress sexily. Dressing up just means wearing something you don’t wear on a daily basis. Wear a simple dress, skirt, or high waisted pleated trousers. Own your look by being confident. He’ll appreciate the effort and the change of pace visually will be exciting for him.

, This way, it'll set the mood, and your boyfriend will most likely feel more comfortable. Refrain from attempting to kiss him in public, for he'll feel more vulnerable and might be too shy to respond to you the way he'd like to.The movies are a very public place, but can be private because of how dark it is in there. It can be very intimate if you take advantage of its potential for seclusion.
Take him on a walk around the park and find a quiet bench hidden by trees to find your romance in.

, A great way to ignite the spark for an intimate moment is by setting the mood with a romantic night out or even one that’s in. Great food can be a great prelude to kissing because both things involve the mouth.The most important components of your romantic night is to have good food to eat somewhere secluded with low lights. Don’t feel pressured to make plans at a decadent restaurant.
If a romantic night out is not in your budget, have a romantic night in. Use the dining room, make him a meal, turn down the lights, and light some candles to create the tone for the night.

, Use your romantic dinner as a way to implement some sexual tension to illicit his desire to kiss you. Have him close his eyes, get close enough to him that he can smell you, and feed him some of the food you’ve ordered or made.Use this game to warm him up for what you have planned later. The intimacy of feeding him plus him feeling you so close to him will charge the tension in the air and send his pulse racing.
If he doesn’t seem open to being fed, try to be intimate in other ways. Be straightforward and enjoy a conversation where you show him that it’s safe to feel safe. A deep conversation is a great step in the right direction of making him feel comfortable with you.

Initiate physical contact after she gives permission.,
Hold her hand.,
Pay attention to her cues.,
Look at her mouth.,
Stop talking.,
Move in close and kiss her.,
Don’t take the kiss too far.,
Create more tension by letting go first.,
Be respectful if she turns you down.",How to Kiss a Girl Smoothly with No Chance of Rejection," While many girls like fast-moving relationships, others will reject your advances if you try too much too soon. If you want to kiss her but you barely know one another, there’s a large chance that she’ll decline the kiss, leaving you both feeling awkward. Make sure that you’ve had ample time to get to know one another and that the kiss won’t catch her off guard.Respect is the most important part of any relationship with a girl, whether it's physical or purely friendly. The more you get to know and respect her, the easier it will be to accept rejection: you'll already be on the way to being good friends even if a romantic relationship doesn't work out.;
, A girl can reject a kiss for many reasons, and some of them have to do with the time and place of the kiss. Knowing her personality will help a lot with this step, because all girls have different preferences when it comes to dating.For example, it’s likely that she won’t like to be kissed with a large group of people nearby, as she may become embarrassed. Try picking a secluded place like a park or quiet room when no one else is around.
If she has a romantic personality, pick a scenic place for your kiss, like a beautiful nature preserve or a quiet art museum. Romantic places come in many varieties, so you’ll have to know her personality to choose the best one. Make sure that it’s a very memorable spot.
Kiss her by her door. If choosing a place for a first kiss is too difficult, go with an old standby. Walk or drive her home, and then go for the kiss at her front door. This works best at the end of a good date., Good grooming habits are important in general, but become even more important when going in for a kiss. Because you’ll be so close to her, she’ll be more likely to notice any flaws in your hygiene.


Make sure your breath is fresh. Gum or mints are a great way to make sure that your breath smells good before going in for a kiss. If you go out for dinner on your date, try to avoid anything too pungent with strong garlic or onions. If your breath is noticeably bad, she may turn down the kiss. Even worse, she may go through with it and have a bad experience that she won’t be able to forget.
Keep your facial hair neat. Some girls like guys with facial hair, and others don’t. It may be too soon in your relationship to know what her preferences are, but you can still extend her some common courtesy. Beards and mustaches can scratch or abrade her face, making the experience unpleasant. Also, unkempt or uneven facial hair is unattractive in general. Trim your facial hair, and use an oil or balm to soften coarse beards and mustaches.Shower and use deodorant. It may seem simple or obvious, but her impression of you will be negative if you have strong body odor or seem unclean. Make sure to take a shower before you meet up.

, Once you’re in the place you picked for the kiss, you’ll need to start a conversation to keep her focused on you. This conversation will help you get closer to her and initiate signals, so make it light and fun. Ask her what she’s going to do later, or talk about your date. Remember to keep strong eye contact throughout, as this will let her know that you’re attracted to her and interested in what she’s saying., Receiving consent for physical contact is an extremely important part of taking it further. It might feel uncomfortable to ask her directly about a kiss, but if you're not comfortable talking about it, you might not be ready to do it. Be direct and honest about your intentions when asking. Asking for permission shows confidence: it lets a girl know that you're not rushing through the motions or trying to use her.


Say: ""I had a really great time with you tonight, and I'm really attracted to you. Would it be okay if I kissed you?"" or ""Do you feel like there's chemistry between us? I really feel it: do you want to kiss?""
Don't stop asking for her permission throughout any intimacy. Physical relationships require ongoing conversations about what's okay and what isn't. Let her know that you're comfortable stopping at any time, and that she should let you know if she ever feels uncomfortable.

, Light physical contact is the best way to communicate with each other about wanting more. If you don’t talk to her and send the right physical signals, she’ll be surprised and may feel uncomfortable if you make a sudden move. Make sure all of your motions are slow and relaxed. Keep talking as you touch her so that your movements aren’t distracting or overly obvious. Remember, if she seems uncomfortable or asks you to stop, stop immediately.Touch her arm first. While you’re talking, reach up and touch her arm. Keep your touch light and relaxed, and don’t move too fast. If she moves away or asks you to stop, let go.
Touch her hand. If you are already touching her arm, all you have to do is move your hand towards hers. If you aren’t touching her yet and need a reason to, ask her about any jewelry or nail polish. It will help keep the conversation going and make her feel more comfortable. When in doubt, ask if you can hold her hand.
Touch her hair. Touching her hair is an obvious sign that you’re attracted to her, and she will definitely notice. If you’re already touching her hand or arm, move your hand to her hair. Make sure you’ve already asked and initiated some other contact first, as reaching straight for her hair may make her uncomfortable. If you need an icebreaker or feel nervous, ask her questions about her hair before touching it: whether it’s her natural color, whether she wears it up or down, etc. Beware that she may dislike this. If she tells you that things feel weird, or asks you not to touch her hair, don't do it.

, If you haven’t held her hand before this point, you’ll definitely want to do it now. Escalate those signals by asking if you can hold her hand. Remember, the more you ask her permission to take further steps, the more she'll know that you respect her and her feelings.


Try squeezing her hand. Increase the firmness of your grip a bit as you talk. If she squeezes back, that’s another good sign that she wants to take things further.

, It’s likely that when you send her physical messages, she’ll respond. It’s possible that she may even initiate the same cues that you were planning to make. You’ll know she’s interested if she touches your chest or arm, looks at your mouth, blushes when you both touch, or has a hard time with prolonged eye contact.Be aware of negative clues as well. If she fails to respond to your physical signals, it's possible that she's not interested or sees you as more of a friend. This isn't a bad thing, it just means that the chemistry might not be there for her. Always be respectful of her wishes, and back off if you start to get the feeling that she's not interested in taking it further.

, If she’s given you permission to touch her, and she's responded well to your physical cues, there’s another important step to take. Continue to make eye contact with her and then look down to her mouth. Keep your eyes focused on her lips for one second, then return your focus to her eyes. Do this several more times throughout the conversation, but don’t overdo it. Look only enough to let her know that you’re thinking about kissing her. If she does the same thing, you’ll know that she’s thinking about it too., If she’s responded well to all of the clues you’re sending her, it’s time to move in for the kiss. Stop the conversation at a convenient point or let it trail away naturally. Wait for a moment after the pause to make sure that she’s comfortable and still interested in kissing you.

, Make sure that you move in with one, calm motion. Move too fast and you risk startling her; move too slow and you may seem too passive. If she's given you permission to make the move, she’ll most likely reciprocate your advance and kiss you back.Continue touching her if you were already making contact before the kiss. Continue holding her hand or touching her arm or shoulder.
Be gentle. Make sure that if you're touching her, you're only applying light pressure. Being too forceful or holding her too firmly might make her uncomfortable, or show that you're moving too fast.

, The first time you kiss a girl, you won’t want to go overboard or turn her off. Make sure that the kiss doesn’t last too long, and that you aren’t too aggressive with your tongue. Your kiss should be calm and confident, and not too fast. If you come on too strong, she may think that you’re desperate or too forward.The kiss should only last a few seconds. There will be plenty more time to continue kissing, especially if you ask her if she wants to continue. If she pulls away first, don't lean into her and try to prolong a kiss.
Keep your hands on her waist, arm or hands. Don't let your hands wander to places that she may be uncomfortable having you touch. Just because she's agreed to kiss doesn't mean that she is ready to go any further.
If she starts to touch you in return, and you feel that she's interested in doing more, break off the kiss and ask her. She'll be glad that you respect her feelings, and she'll be able to tell you if there's anything she wants to do next.

, If you stay in control of the kiss and break it off first, you’ll show her that you’re confident and in control, and that you’re not moving too quickly. She may go back in for another kiss or tell you that she wants you to kiss her again: if so, go for it.When the kiss ends, ask her if she's okay, or ask how she's feeling. The moment after a kiss can be a bit awkward, but asking if she's alright will give you an idea of what she's thinking about or feeling.
If she says that she's alright, and is happy, you've done a good job with your first kiss. Try not to make things awkward by getting flustered or asking for more physical contact. Stay relaxed, continue talking, or let her go for the night if you've walked her home.
If she says she's not alright, don't be upset. She may not have felt a connection with you, or she may have been uncomfortable with the kiss. She might let you know the reasons that she felt uncomfortable. Listen to what she says, and respect her feelings about the physical contact.

, If you’ve done your best to send signals and talk to her throughout the process, she still may or may not reciprocate. Girls sometimes turn down a kiss or cut off a situation for their own reasons. She not be emotionally ready, or she might not be attracted to you. No matter what, always respect her decision. Don’t get upset or try to change her mind, as she’ll become upset with you.

Take stock of your opinion on your partner.,
Consider whether you support your partner's success.,
Ask yourself if your partner factors into your decisions.,
Think about your future.,
Consider how you feel about your partner's flaws.,
See if the two of you compromise.,
See if you want others to like your partner.,
Consider how you experience jealousy.,
Ask friends and family members whether you've changed.,
See if you feel like you can express yourself.,
Consider whether you feel happy around your partner.,

Watch for physical changes.,
Be aware of your physical desires.",How to Tell if You Are in Love," Obviously, examining how you feel about your partner can help you tell if you're in love. However, it's not always in ways you would consider. In addition to considering traditional factors like butterflies in your stomach, take note of how you feel about him or her as a person.


Do you think your partner is special? When in love, people tend to magnify positive qualities of another person while ignoring or overlooking the negative. You should think your partner is somehow objectively special and stands out from other people.Do you find yourself missing your partner a lot when you're apart, even for short periods? When people are in love, especially in the early stages, they want to be together all the time. How much you miss a person can relate to how fond you are of him or her. Think about how much you miss your partner. This can be a strong indicator of whether or not you're in love.Do you like your partner as a person? It sounds strange, but many people have lustful relationships that seem like romantic love with people they don't really like. When you're in love, you should think your partner has a desirable personality. An underlying friendship, or at least mutual liking, is an important predecessor to love.;
, You should genuinely want your partner to succeed if you're in love. If you're in love with someone, you'll find yourself thrilled for his or her personal triumphs.


People often feel inferior in the face of the accomplishments of others, even close friends, but what's different about romantic love is that you don't feel this sense of inferiority when your partner succeeds.Even if you have not been successful or have suffered recent failures, you will still feel happiness at your partner's success. This is one way that romantic partners feel connected. Your partner's success should almost feel like your own., When in love, people are more likely to base decisions around their partners. This doesn't just apply to major decisions, like whether to take a job or move to a new city. Even minor decisions may be based around your partner's tastes.


When in love, even daily priorities will make you think of your partner. When you get dressed in the morning, for example, you might find yourself picking an outfit you think your partner would like on you.You'll find yourself willing to experience new things based on your partner's interest. For example, you may suddenly want to go hiking if your partner enjoys it even though you're not normally an outdoors person. You may want to listen to music and watch movies outside the realm of your usual tastes just because your partner is interested in them., When you're in love, you'll feel in it for the long term. When you dream about your own future, like a new job or moving to a new city, you will likely incorporate your partner into those dreams in some ways.If you want children, do you think about children with your partner? Do you consider whether he or she would be a good parent? Can you imagine having kids with another person or only with your partner? Have the two of you discussed children or the future? If so, it might be love.
Do you think about growing old with your partner? Do you like the idea of the two of you aging side-by-side? Do you imagine distant things, like retirement and 50th anniversaries?
When you make big decisions for your own future, does your partner factor in? Can you not picture moving to a new city or taking a new job without your partner's support or presence?

, While you magnify positive qualities during the early stages of love, eventually you will realize your partner is flawed. How you feel about his or her flaws can be an indicator of whether or not you're in love.


If you're comfortable admitting your partner has flaws, and can accept him or her despite them, this is a good sign. The idea of your partner as perfect only lasts so long and you should be able to accept bad qualities as well as good ones. Being able to accept negative things about your partner may help you stay committed to him or her.Are you able to talk to your partner about his or her flaws? Can the two of you laugh about them? Do you want to help your partner deal with his or her flaws if they're getting in the way of success? If you're invested in making your partner the best version of him or herself, this is a sign it may be love.

, When people are in love, they're willing to compromise. When you and your partner disagree, you should be able to reach decisions that are mutually beneficial to both of you. Love means wanting another person to feel comfortable and happy, so if you're in love you must be willing to compromise., When you're in love with someone, you'll be invested in the impression they make on friends and family members. See how you feel when your partner meets people close to you. How much do you care whether they like this person?


Your social circle plays a big role in the success of your romantic relationship. Even if you really like someone, if your family or friends do not this creates tension. Therefore, if you're in love you'll be heavily infested in how your partner is perceived by others.If you find yourself paying close attention to how your friends and family members act around your partner, this is a good sign. It means you're invested in the success of the relationship and you may be in love., Jealousy is actually a healthy component to a romantic relationship. However, how you experience jealousy is important.Evolutionarily speaking, jealousy makes sense. It means you're suspicious of potential threats which means you're committed to the success of your relationship. If you're in love, you may find yourself getting jealous of your partner's interactions with other people and feel somewhat possessive when you're out in public.However, jealousy can become toxic if it manifests itself in suspicion. Distrust is a sign you may not really be in love. Do you feel the need to check your partner's text messages and emails? If so, you might want to reevaluate your relationship., When you're in love, you'll find yourself changing. Small things, like your tastes, as well as big matters, like your life priorities, will alter when you're with your partner.


When you're in love, you'll take on new characteristics. You'll find yourself developing different tastes and things like your sense of humor and style may change slightly. You may not feel this difference, however, as it happens somewhat subtly.Ask people close to you, such as friends and family members, whether they've noticed you changing. Is your personality, tastes, or style at all different than it was when the relationship began? If the answer is yes, you may be in love., If you're in love with someone, you should feel loved in return. Many people describe feeling in love as feeling that another person understands them. If this is the case, you should have no trouble expressing yourself around your partner.Do you feel like you can talk about yourself and your problems without fear of judgment? Can you bring up negative emotions you're feeling, even selfish ones, without feeling your partner will think any less of you?
Do you feel like you can disagree with your partner, even on big matters? If you have different religious or political beliefs, for example, do you feel your partner respects your beliefs even when not sharing them ?
Are you comfortable being yourself around your partner? Can you use your own sense of humor, laugh, cry, and experience the full range of emotions around him or her?

, While this might seem obvious, many people will realize they're not actually their happiest around their partner. While your partner should not be the only thing that brings you joy, you should experience excitement and genuine pleasure in his or her presence. Not every day needs to be absolutely thrilling, but you should look forward to seeing your partner and always find the two of you have fun together. Even little things, like watching television, can be made more enjoyable by your partner's presence.


This doesn't mean that you're blissfully happy every second of the time you two are together. Such an expectation isn't realistic; relationships are work, even between highly compatible people, and sometimes conflicts and disagreements happen. However, research suggests that the ratio of positive to negative experiences in successful relationships is about 20:1.Basically, you should feel happy in your partner's presence more often than not.
Feeling consistently unhappy or distressed around your partner is one sign of a problematic relationship., Your brain secretes three chemicals, phenethylamine, dopamine, and oxytocin, when you begin to fall in love. These chemicals have a major effect on your emotional behavior. Dopamine in particular is associated with your brain's ""reward"" pathways, meaning feeling ""in love"" is something your brain enjoys and wants to experience more of.During the initial phases of love, you may notice a heightened mood, high self esteem, and a tendency to do things that are out of the ordinary for you. For example, you may be inspired to perform grand romantic gestures like buying expensive gifts.You may also find yourself preoccupied, constantly checking your phone, e-mail, or social media pages to see if this person has reached out to you in any way.You may also experience certain negative emotions. You may have a heightened fear of rejection and experience sudden moods. You may replay key moments over and over, worrying that your first kiss wasn't quite right or that you said something that sounds silly at dinner.
The mental response behind love can cause acute feelings of longing. If you feel acute longing, even after short periods apart, you may be in love., Due to the chemicals released by the brain during love, there are a number of physical responses as well. It might be love if you experience any of the following:


Increased energy
Loss of appetite
Trembling
A racing heart
Difficulty breathing, Physically, you will experience desire for your partner. This should not be solely in the form of sexual desire but also manifested in a desire for touching and cuddling throughout the day.


Oxytocin is what drives your physical needs when you're in love. It's sometimes referred to as the cuddling hormone. You'll find yourself wanting to kiss, cuddle, and touch your partner throughout the day. You'll want to have a heavy amount of physical contact with this person at all times.While sex is an important component to falling in love with someone, it likely will not be the most important factor. Most people in love find that an emotional connection with their partner is more important than a merely sexual one. If you're in love, you will feel like your relationship is more than just sex."

Listen to your partner.,
Go to bed together.,
Wake up together.,
Make time to support their endeavours.",How to Say I Love You Without Words1," Regardless of what point you are in a relationship, or what relationship you have with a person, everyone wants to feel valued. One of the clearest ways to show someone that you love them is to actively listen to what they have to say. Put away any distractions, make eye contact with the other person, and show that you care.You should talk back when it is your turn to talk, but don’t interrupt the person.;
, Even if days are super busy, going to bed with your partner can allow you at least a little intimate time together each night. It allows the two of you to have pillow talk to cuddle up before going to sleep (or while sleeping even). Making an effort to wrap up your evening and go to bed with your partner is a great way to say that you love them., While you may be on a different schedule than your partner, it speaks volumes if the two of you wake up together. Having time for a cup of coffee together (or even better a full breakfast) before the day starts can really show that you are going the extra mile to say “I love you.”Even if one of you goes back to sleep after the other leaves or starts working, that is fine. Just making the effort to spend those few moments together is what is important.

, Since every relationship and every person is different, you and your partner may or may not be in the same career field or enjoy all of the same things in your free time. That being said, it is important that you support each other by showing up to big events. This might be going as a date to your partner’s business meeting or dinner, or something going to watch them play in a tennis match. What is important here is that you show up to support your partner both at home and in public.It is also a nice gesture to be supportive on days that aren’t big events. For example, you might surprise your partner by stopping in at the office with their favorite lunch one day. Just be careful not to do this everyday or take it to an overbearing extreme.

Touch each other throughout the day.,
Cuddle at night.,
Talk to each other openly.,
Text or call each other for no reason.,
Do things together.",How to Say I Love You Without Words2," Physical touch is an important part of relationships. It builds trust and intimacy. Remember to do things like kiss your partner, or hold their hand on a walk. Also, TV time can be great for cuddling up together.Doing something for your partner like a back massage or foot massage can be romantic and much appreciated. There are also other types of massage, such as an Indian head massage.

, Many people do not like to cuddle while they sleep. Luckily, this is optional. What you should do, however, is carve out a few minutes each night before sleep to cuddle. This has been shown to help build and maintain a healthy connection between partners and allows each person their own space to sleep afterward (if needed).This kind of intimacy is also shown to lead to a healthier sex life.

, Asking each other about the day is a great place to start. You also need to carve out time to listen to your partner’s thoughts and have a deep conversation from time to time. The other side of being open is expressing when you disagree with your partner, and this should be done respectfully. Talk to your partner as if they are someone you love and care about, even when you disagree. This really shows your partner that you love them.Note that you are using words in this step. Communicating is an important part of any relationship, but they way you communicate with your partner can show love without explicitly saying “I love you.”
For example, your partner might say something like “I had a strange dream last night.” To this, you could respond with something that shows your care and interest, like “I don’t really remember my dream from last night. What was yours about?”

, This can be especially important for long distance relationships, but makes a huge impact on all relationships. Sending your partner a text or giving them a call when you have a minute or two extra shows that you are thinking of them and that you want to talk to them. Knowing that they cross your mind throughout the day will make your partner feel loved and appreciated.


You might text or call your partner for something as simple as to say “I’m having pizza for dinner. Are you having anything good?” This shows that you are interested in sharing the minute details of your day with your partner, and also hearing about theirs.

, This can be tricky sometimes. Of course you should do things that you both enjoy together, but what about other things? It is important to do things with your partner that they enjoy, even if it isn’t your favorite pastime. Keep in mind, that your partner should do the same for you. This helps you both bond and learn more about each other."
"
Make your partner a gift.,
Give them something that they can’t find easily.,
Give gifts freely.",How to Say I Love You Without Words3," There is nothing wrong with buying a gift from the store, but the thought and time that goes into making a gift for someone can really say “I love you.” Think about things that are special in your relationship to incorporate into a gift. It can be something as simple as framing pictures from a vacation, or as involved as building your partner a piece of furniture. This is an instance where the thought really does count., Maybe your partner had a favorite toy when they were growing up, or they love a certain brand of honey that isn’t available where you live. Go out of your way to try and find a special something for your loved one and they will really appreciate the effort. Not only are you giving them a gift, but you are also showing how well you know them and how much you listen to them., While each partner should contribute in any kind of relationship, you shouldn’t expect the immediate reciprocation of a gift. With holidays like Christmas or anniversaries as exceptions, your partner may not even know that you intend to give a gift. Allow them to appreciate you and give them time to put back into the relationship.

"
"
Leave your partner a note.,
Do a chore you wouldn’t normally do.,
Do a the things they hate doing.,
Surprise your partner.",How to Say I Love You Without Words4," This is a great way to brighten your partner’s day. You could leave a note on the bedside table, or slip it in their lunch bag. When your partner finds the note, they know that you were thinking ahead of time to make their day special.Though leaving a note is technically using words, but it shows a degree of consideration that goes beyond just saying “I love you.”

, In most relationships, the chores generally end up split in some way. Even if it starts by accident, somebody will probably end up being the kitchen cleaner and someone will end up being the car washer. From time to time you can go out of your way to do one of the tasks that your partner usually does. This shows them that you notice their efforts and want to help., Aside from keeping up you end of things, it means a lot if you always do the thing your partner hates doing. This might mean doing dishes or cleaning the toilet. It doesn’t matter what the task is, your partner will appreciate that you are willing to do it for them because you love them., All too often we let our relationships get dull. We fall into a routine and we sacrifice spontaneity in the name of survival. This is pretty normal, and a schedule can be a great thing. That being said, you should break the rules from time to time and surprise your partner. This can be as simple as stopping by the store and picking up their favorite movie and a bottle of wine, or booking a hotel room for a weekend (or midweek) getaway.Even just being playful or surprising your partner with a hug can make a difference.
Do plan your surprise to some extent. If you are going to have a special evening or weekend for your significant other, make sure that they will be free.

Keep busy.,
Change your routine.,
Focus on why it would not work out.,
Say goodbye.,
Get rid of reminders.",How to Stop Being in Love With a Person You'll Never Meet1," Stay occupied during your spare time so that you don’t give yourself a lot of time to think about them. Take up new hobbies, pick up old ones, ask friends out for coffee or dinner, join a club, take a class, or volunteer. Fill your days and nights so that you’re enjoying life and aren’t spending much time thinking of them.You will notice that thinking of them is regressive – you will think of them less and less over time.;
, You might have a routine of texting them every morning, or talking on the phone every night, and come to expect that is what you’ll do every day. Change your routine so that you don’t expect to talk, text, or video chat with them at certain times throughout the day. If you normally talk in the morning, try exercising instead. Or if you always text at lunch, plan to read a book instead.Your routine won’t change effortlessly, and that is okay. Stick with it and before you know it, what was work will be your new routine.
If they try to continue with routines that involve you, such as phone calls or texts, you can explain that you no longer wish to speak with them on the phone, for example, or you may take a more thorough approach and block them on social media.
If you choose to block them, block their phone number so that they may not call or text you also.

, It may help you to look at all of the reasons why a relationship with this person is not realistic. Try making a list of all of the reasons why it would not work out. You might include:


Distance, such as living in different states, countries, or even different continents.
Differences in lifestyle, personality, or interests. For example, maybe the person you are in love with is an outgoing sports enthusiast who loves to attend parties and other social events. If you are more of an introvert who likes to watch movies and hang out at home with just a few people at a time, then your lifestyles, personalities, and interests might not mesh well.
Different relationship goals, such as wanting marriage while the other person may not be interested in a monogamous relationship at all.

, You don’t have to actually say goodbye to them, but you do need to say goodbye to the relationship. Reconcile with yourself that you need to stop being in love with them, and that it’s time to let go. This can be a painful process, but it’s necessary because it signals that you’ve made a decision to stop being in love and move on.You can say goodbye, you can write it in a letter, or a poem, or simply process it internally by thinking about it.
If you share a friend or hobby group, you may decide that you want to maintain a friendship with them. If that’s the case, explain to them that you’re ending the romantic part of your relationship but look forward to a mature and healthy friendship.
If you think it would be better to cut all ties, it’s up to you whether you want to explain that you want no further contact with them.

, While you’ll never meet, you might have exchanged letters, trinkets, gifts, or other items. You need to get rid of these reminders so that you can begin the process of healing and falling out of love. Box the items up and throw them away or ask someone else to discard them for you. This should happen at the same time that you say goodbye to allow yourself a clean slate."
"
Plan how to start the conversation or letter.,
Send an email.,
Send a direct message.,
Speak on the phone or video chat.,
Get closure.",How to Stop Being in Love With a Person You'll Never Meet2," Before you contact the person to tell him or her that you want to end the relationship, take some time to plan out what to say. Try writing out what you want or need to say ahead of time. There are several different ways that you can start this conversation. Some potential opening lines that you might use include:


""I need to talk to you about something important...""
""Do you have time to talk about something important? I want to discuss…""
""I don't know the best way to start, but...""
""I'm heartbroken about this, but...""

, This is probably the least personal way to end the relationship, but it does allow you to write your thoughts out carefully and choose your words intentionally. Ending the relationship via email also gives you an opportunity to speak without interruption or rebuttal. This method also gives the recipient time to reflect on what you’ve written before they respond.Don’t write extensively about what went wrong. Instead, simply say that you need to end the relationship and what it is you expect going forward, be it no communication, limited communication, or a thriving friendship.

, Ending a relationship over chat is a bit more complicated because you need to make sure that you and the other person are both able to chat at the same time without interruptions. You’ll still tell the other person that you are ending the relationship and what you expect going forward. The difference is that chat or direct message facilitates a conversation, which will allow the other person an opportunity to respond to what you’re saying.If you think that they won’t take your ending the relationship well, you might consider writing an email instead of allowing them to respond to you in a direct message.

, You may decide that you want to speak to the other person, either on the phone, or over video chat, so that you can have the closest conversation possible without being face-to-face. On the phone or in video chat you’ll still need to focus on your decision to end the relationship and your expectations. Don’t be accusatory or rude because that’s unproductive and will just provoke anger or hurt in them.If you are nervous that they will try to talk you out of ending the relationship, opt to send an email instead of the more personal routes of conversation.

, When ending a relationship, especially with someone who you love, obtaining closure can be an important step in the healing process. Closure lets you both know that you appreciate your experiences together, but that that it’s time for both of you to move forward without one another. Communicate with the person that you love and tell them not only how you’re feeling, but that you need to restrict or cut off communication, and that you wish them the best.Sometimes it’s not possible to have a conversation that brings you satisfying closure. That’s okay. That lack is a closure in and of itself. Move forward and focus on healing yourself.

Decide what sort of relationship you’re looking for.,
Consider your self-esteem.,
Learn from your experiences.",How to Stop Being in Love With a Person You'll Never Meet3," Make a list of what you’re looking for in a relationship, such as companionship, partnership, someone to share life events with, someone to talk with, and so on. This will help you figure out if you’re looking for an online or face-to-face relationship. You may discover that you actually want physical companionship as well, which will help you stop being in love with the person you’ll never meet., If you have fallen into a habit of thinking that no one will be attracted to you or that no one in your town or city is available, an Internet relationship can be an easy substitute for dealing with personal issues. Instead of focusing your energies on a relationship, spend that time and energy working on yourself and your self-esteem. Take two minutes every day to quietly think about that which you appreciate about yourself, such as your sense of humor, your eyes, your intellect, or even your shopping savvy.
Make an effort to be kinder to others. You will have a better opinion of yourself the kinder you are to others., Even though this relationship hasn’t met your needs, it was still a good learning experience. Whether you've learned that you can be loved, that your personality is relationship-worthy, or that long-distance relationships are just plain hard sometimes, the important thing is to not let the whole situation be a wasted experience.Consider what was good about your relationship. Was it educational? Or did it help you mature emotionally? Was it nice to have a confidant? Thinking about the positive aspects will help you figure out what you want in future relationships.Similarly, consider what needs you had that weren’t met in the relationship. Was it difficult to coordinate schedules? Or did you have different life goals?
Lastly, consider what did and did not make you happy in your relationship. Thinking about these aspects of your relationship will help you identify your needs and what you want in future relationships.

Reallocate your resources.,
Accept that you feel may conflicted.,
Break the cycle.",How to Stop Being in Love With a Person You'll Never Meet4," Being in love with a person who you’ll never meet is a good learning experience and has the potential to meet many of your emotional needs. However, it also uses up so many of your emotional, financial, and time resources. Choose to reallocate those resources to dating locally. Because you’ll be able to meet people locally, your resources will be much better invested.Go on a local dating website
Or look at a national website, but select your geographic area
Or look to local hobby groups
Ask a friend to set you up with someone
Join a local recreational sports league

, You may feel an internal conflict when you decide to end your relationship to pursue dating locally. Choosing to date locally can be intimidating, especially if you’re in love with someone who you’ll never meet. You have an emotional and intellectual connection with that person, but seek a physical connection as well. Recognize that you feel conflicted, accept that it’s okay, and give yourself permission to seek happiness in a local relationship.It’s good and healthy to admit that you’ll never meet this person for whom you have feelings. Maintaining even the slightest hope that you’ll meet them may only intensify your inner conflict.

, Ending a love relationship can be painful, and it’s not something that you want to feel again intentionally. Refrain from starting another relationship with someone else that you won’t meet. If necessary, stop using the Internet for a while to prevent opportunities for falling into a similarly difficult relationship.Find new games to play, new message boards with which to interact, and new groups to join.
You learned from previous experience that it was important to meet the person who you love, so you want to avoid starting a similar relationship with someone in these new groups or communities.

Do your best to make sure she likes you.,
Make sure your breath smells nice before asking her to dance.,
Ask her to dance to a slow song.,
Go with the flow.,
Move in closer and whisper something sweet.,
Move your face back and look into her eyes.,
Tilt your head and gently kiss her.,
Caress and her neck and hair.,
Go in for a deeper kiss.,
Back your head away and look into her eyes as you finish kissing.",How to Kiss a Girl While Dancing," Knowing whether a girl likes you or not is far from easy. If there’s any indication that she’s not into you or not comfortable kissing, stop in your tracks: never try to force a girl to do anything. Before making any moves, think about some signs she might be giving you.When the two of you talk, does she touch your shoulder, or otherwise try to make body contact? Has she ever blushed or batted her eyelashes when the two of you talk?
Have any of her friends asked you what you think about her? Have they ever given you any hints that she likes you?
Perhaps you asked her to go to the dance with you and she said yes. That’s a good sign that she likes you, but keep in mind she might just like you as a friend. Look for other hints instead of making assumptions.;
, Breath mints are a key part of setting the stage. Keep a pack of mints in your pocket, and pop one in before asking for a dance. If the music is loud and you lean in close to ask her for a dance, you’re much more likely to get a “Yes!” if your breath is minty fresh.Choose mints over gum. You don’t want to be stuck with gum in your mouth later when you go in for a kiss.
Put a bit of chapstick on, too. Don’t use too much, as gooey lips aren’t much better than chapped lips. Try not to use mints and chapstick in front of her, or you’ll look like you’re trying too hard.

, Ideally, ask her to dance when a romantic song comes on that you both know. Think about requesting a song from the DJ if possible, and choose a song you know she finds meaningful. If you two are close, and if she’s comfortable with it, wrap one arm around her waist and take the other in your other hand as you lead her to the dance floor.


Try to be charming and polite. If she’s sitting down when you ask her, take her hand in yours and gently draw her up to her feet or closer to you.
It’s certainly fine to be a bit nervous, but try not to break the ice by being silly. For example, don't hold her hand way out away from you and act like you’re about to dance a tango. Try to be sweet, sincere, and romantic instead of making a joke out of it.

, Trying to control everything will most likely just ruin the moment. Just try to relax and let it happen.You might find that the moment just doesn’t feel right. Do your best to feel out the moment and let it build up, rather than go in with a “now or never” mindset.
It might be better to try another time, especially if it’s your (or her) first kiss, rather than go in and knock each other’s teeth, bump heads, or get turned down.

, Gently move your face closer to hers. If you know the words to the song and can carry a tune, try gently singing along to the song to her. Do your best to be just loud enough for her to hear without ruining the moment by shouting in her ear.


If you don’t know the words or aren’t comfortable singing to her, just tell her something sweet. Try saying “You are absolutely beautiful,"" or ""You know, this dress is so gorgeous on you.""
As you sing or whisper a compliment, hold her close to you. Gently put your arms around her and caress her to build up the moment.Make sure she’s comfortable, and give her space if she’s stiff or pulls away from you.

, Try to make this a gradual movement instead of a quick jerk. Gently tilt your head, brush your noses together, and rest your forehead against hers. Look into her eyes for two or three seconds, but try not to just give a blank stare. You should be genuine and look at her deeply - make sure you mean it!After two or three seconds, slowly start closing your eyes. When you actually move in to kiss her, there’s nothing creepier than having your eyes open.If she doesn't want to kiss you, she'll let you know at this stage by moving her face away from yours or trying to back away. Give her space and just dance until the song is finished, then thank her for dancing with you.

, Purse your lips and go in with a sweet, gentle kiss. Don’t go all in: don’t use your tongue, try to French kiss, or make out. Start out slowly, using just your lips, and after a two or three seconds, draw back a bit and give her a little smile.Try not to be too nervous. If you're already close to her and dancing, she probably wants to kiss just as much as you do. At this point she may open her eyes to look at you before moving in for a kiss of her own.

, If everything has gone well so far, gently brush your fingertips up her neck to cup her head in your hand. Move in to kiss her more deeply as you run your fingers through her hair, but don't make her feel like you're pulling it.If her hair is up or neatly done, she might not want you to mess with it. If this is the case, just gently cup her neck with your fingertips.

, Lock lips with her by taking her lower lip between your lips. Gently massage her lip using yours, but do your best to keep your lips relaxed and soft.


Even though you’re going in for a deeper kiss, try to avoid slobbering. Wet lips on wet lips is nice, but putting your lips all over her face will make her feel like she’s kissing a dog.
Keep both your tongue (if you choose to use it at all) and saliva in check. Don't just stick your tongue in her mouth, and no drooling!, Do your best to feel out the moment and let the kiss come to a finish naturally. If she’s still kissing you, don't pull away abruptly, but back off if it feels like it’s coming to a natural conclusion. Lift your head away, look into her eyes again, smile, and if it feels right say something like, “That was really nice.”


You might judge from the moment that talking would just ruin the mood, or she might put her head on your shoulder. In either case, just keep dancing until the song ends.

Conduct a sexy chocolate treasure hunt.,
Make a playlist of music featuring chocolate.,
Take a bath in chocolate.,
Have chocolate on the menu for breakfast, lunch or dinner.,
Try body painting with chocolate.,
Give a gift of exclusive chocolates.,
Visit a chocolate spa.",How to Use Chocolate to Spice up Your Relationship," Choose a time when the kids are with friends and create a steamy game of chocolate hide and go seek. Don’t tell your significant other, just allude to an evening of intimacy and to “be ready.”


Purchase a large box of pre-wrapped chocolates––preferably your partners’ favorites.
Create either a trail of chocolate pieces (and rose petals) leading to the boudoir or devise an interactive treasure hunt.
For treasure hunt clues, weave both humor and romance into the text such as, “Find your next treat in the place where I take my evening seat (a favorite sofa).”
Leave a small clue with each piece of chocolate until the hunt culminates either in the bedroom or in a cozy area of your home where you have arranged for a romantic dinner for two.
The end of the chocolate treasure hunt could involve you smothered in chocolate or at least with chocolates artistically laid out across your body.;
, A simple search using the term ""chocolate"" on a music program such as iTunes will reward you with numerous tracks based on chocolate or chocolate themes. Choose ones that you like and put together a chocolate infused music compilation to play in the background during your chocolate romancing.

, Skip squeezing the Hershey’s syrup into the tub and do a chocolate bath the right way. While the Internet is loaded with plenty of chocolate bath recipes, you may like to try wikiHow's own chocolate bath recipe or a chocolate bubble bath. Although you may be tempted to sample the chocolate while you bathe, resist the urge to imbibe. Think about where your feet have been over the past few hours and your temptation to drink the chocolate will fade away! And as well as soaking in sensual chocolate, you can stimulate the senses with a few added touches:



Champagne for two––skip plastic cups or ordinary glasses and go for the real crystal flutes.
Scented chocolate candles––fill the room with the aroma of chocolate by lighting several chocolate-scented candles around the bathroom.
A plate of chilled, fresh fruit. While strawberries are usually preferable, explore adding mango, berries and cherries.

, Surprise your honey by having a full chocolate feast instead of the usual fare. For example, dine on chocolate croissants for breakfast or serve nothing but chocolate dessert for lunch. For dinner, it’s possible to infuse main course, appetizers, drinks and dessert with chocolate and finding the right recipe need not pose a huge challenge. Look at Mexican cuisine chocolate main course recipes such as chicken mole (or vegan mole). And beyond that, here’s an example of what you could make:


Beef stew with chocolate: combine two pounds of chopped beef stew meat with traditional spices such as salt and pepper. Sear meat in a large saucepan over high heat until all sides are brown and caramelized. Set aside. Combine one cup of sliced carrots, 8 ounces of mushrooms, three cups of diced potatoes, one 14.5 ounce can of tomatoes and the beef in a slow cooker. In a separate bowl, mix two tablespoons of finely grated dark chocolate, one teaspoon grated garlic, one meatloaf packet, one 14 ounce can of beef broth, and one cup of red wine. Pour over the beef mixture in the slow cooker and cook for four to six hours.
White knight-tini: Mix two shots of vanilla vodka combined with two shots of white chocolate liqueur and half shot of chocolate liqueur. Stir, strain and serve over ice. For an added touch, dip the glass rims in warmed white chocolate.

, Although it may be tempting to try painting with regular brand chocolate, consider going for chocolate that is made especially for body painting. One distinct advantage is that body painting chocolate is ready for fun––no mixing or re-configuring the make-up to find the right consistency. However, if you insist on DIY’ing your chocolate body painting experience, try this recipe:


17.5 ounces of dark chocolate (sweet and/or semi-sweet) chopped, 13.5 ounces of cream, a handful of chopped mint leaves, one finely chopped chili pepper and a double shot of espresso. Divide cream into three different pans, add mint and chili to one pan and the espresso to the third pan. Slowly warm each pan to almost a simmer (for approximately 15 minutes). Melt chocolate in a separate pan either in the microwave or by using the double boiler method. Remove from heat and divide chocolate into the three pans. Return pans to low heat and simmer until fully combined.

, At the end of a day or evening of chocolate romance, provide your beloved with a memento that can last a few more days. Buy the most delectable box of chocolates possible (or naughty anatomy chocolates) and present your beloved with it to help him or her recapture the evening of chocolate indulgence for a little longer yet. Seal the giving with a French kiss involving passing an exquisite chocolate between the two of you.

, For the ultimate in chocolate romance, book a trip to a spa that specializes in chocolate treatments. Numerous local spas offer chocolate massages and facials to tantalize the spirit and the senses. While this one takes a little more planning, it can be a truly enjoyable experience for your chocoholic beloved and gives you both the excuse to get away and totally indulge for a short time.


For the all-encompassing supreme experience, consider a visit to The Spa at the Hershey Hotel. Parked in Hershey, Pennsylvania, couples can revel in all things chocolate. Treatments include hydrotherapy, facials, massages and body wraps. If you don't live near here, plan a vacation treat for another time.

Trust people when they tell you that they love you.,
Stop fearing loss.,
Love yourself.,
Let love in and don't block it.,
Beware the voices of societal negativity.,
Show love.,
Watch the experts at receiving love.",How to Receive Love," Whether it be an intimate relationship, a friendship, or a family relationship, it is important to accept the declaration of love at face value. If you are pushing aside the gift of their love for you because you are afraid that they do not mean it, then you prevent them from having the chance to prove that they do. It also might push them away from you, so that if you change your mind it may be too late.;
, A common reason for not being able to receive love is prior experience of losing someone you loved, whether it was from death, a break-up, or for some other reason that has scarred you. If you spend all of your life pushing aside love given to you on the off-chance that the person offering it might withdraw it, you will always feel cynical and unsure, which is not a comfortable or happy place to be. Instead, embrace the love that they are offering and go with the flow, expecting those who offer you love to stay around.

, This might be the hardest step of all but if you don't love yourself that much, receiving love is impossible because you don't believe that you deserve it. If this is the case, start working on why you can't love yourself so well, including seeking help to explore the issues involved if needed. Remember that every person is special and that you are very deserving of love.

, Simply open your heart, live in the moment and cherish the fact that other people care so deeply about you that you are connected, needed, wanted, and included in the affairs and lives of others. Being open and receptive to the love from others can be learned with practice, provided you don't let cynicism and toughness take over. Let down some of those defenses and pride and let others know that you enjoy their deep care and support for you. And forget about keeping score; love others even if it is not reciprocated. As one large human family, it keeps going around and we receive it back again anyway.

, Social conditioning has a habit of making us feel wary of being effusive about and openly accepting of compliments, generosity, caring, and kind acts, lest we be seen as greedy, prideful, or selfish. Do not push aside the caring, wonderful things people have to say about you just because of such negative overlays; be appreciative and embracing of the love given out by others in all its forms. To do otherwise is to block receipt of love.

, Receiving love is also about expressing love. Kiss your spouse and children, hug your friends, compliment your colleagues, say friendly and complimentary things to the grocery store clerks. Do this regularly.

, Children are expert at receiving love because they accept what is said at face value and view receiving love as natural. What is also natural is that being able to receive love creates a balance in which you give and receive in equal measure. Take note of how children manage this beautifully - they ask for help when needed, they give help when asked. They offer compliments without a thought and they accept at face value the compliments that they are given. Re-learning what was once innate for you can restore a lot of happiness and trust in your life.

There are many different types of fear that can cause a person to fear loving someone or being loved.Consider your feelings and try to figure out what your main concern is. What are you afraid might happen if you allow yourself to love or be loved?
Try writing about your feelings to explore them in more depth. Writing about your fears concerning love may help you to identify the root of your fears and the act of writing may help you to work through some of your feelings as well.;
, One way that you can start to understand your fear regarding loving or being loved is to think back on your past relationships. Consider the problems that arose in the relationship and how you contributed to those problems.What did you struggle with in the relationship? What did you fight about? If you broke up, what was the reason for the breakup? In what ways did you contribute to problems in the relationship? What thoughts caused you to respond in the ways that you did?

, Sometimes childhood experiences can contribute to our ability to love and be loved. If you had some difficult experiences as a child, you may be carrying to feelings into your adult relationships. Consider things that happened to you or around you as a child and how they might be affecting you as an adult.Was there a lot of fighting in your household when you were a child? Did you feel rejected or unloved by one or more of your parents? How did these experiences make you feel?

, Many people have fears when it comes to loving and being loved. Among those fears are the fear of getting hurt, fear of hurting someone, and fear of commitment. Consider these different types of fears and try to determine if your feelings align with any of these categories.Fear of Getting Hurt If you have been hurt in previous relationships, you know how painful it is and may want to protect yourself from ever feeling that way again. As a result, you might try to prevent yourself from falling in love in order to avoid having to feel those painful emotions again.

Fear of Hurting Someone Perhaps you have hurt people in previous relationships and it made you feel guilty. As a result, you might want to avoid getting into another relationship and causing the same pain to someone else who you care about.

Fear of Commitment Maybe the idea of being committed to one person for the rest of your life is terrifying to you, so you don’t allow yourself to get too attached.

Fear of Loss of Identity Some people think falling in love means that they have to give up certain parts of their identity, which can be scary and may cause some people may avoid love.

, Some people struggle to love and be loved because they believe that they are not loveable or not worthy of being loved. This belief can be the result of childhood neglect, rejection, or other experiences that caused you to feel unworthy of being loved. Consider whether or not your feel like you are worth of being loved., Some people fear love because it makes them think about their mortality. Loving someone and being loved back can make the thought of death much scarier because you have more to lose. Some people may even avoid falling in love or being loved because of these negative, frightening feelings., In addition to past relationships and childhood experiences, negative thinking may be preventing you from loving or being loved. Some people think negative thoughts about themselves or their partners that cause the relationship to suffer. Do not allow a negative thought to go through your mind without addressing and reframing it. Doing so will help you to change your mindset and stop reinforcing your fears about loving or being loved. The next time you have a negative thought, turn it into a positive one.For example, if you are worried about being rejected, you might think something like, “She’s way out of my league. She’s going to dump me.” Or, if you feel unworthy of being loved you might think something like, “You are too ugly for anyone to ever love you, so don’t even try.”
These thoughts are damaging to your self-esteem and to your ability to love and be loved. If you are dealing with these types of negative thoughts, you will need to work to silence them and change them.
The next time that you find yourself thinking a negative thought, stop yourself and change the thought. If you think to yourself, “She’s way out of my league. She’s going to dump me,” turn it into something more positive. Change it to something like, “She’s a beautiful woman. I am excited to see where this relationship goes.”

, You might also benefit from some positive self-talk regarding love. Try using positive daily affirmations to develop more positive feelings about love. Positive daily affirmations can help you to deal with the negative emotions that may be part of your fears about love. Take a few moments each day to look at yourself in the mirror and say something positive about love. You can say something that you believe about love or something that you would like to believe about love.Some examples of things you might tell yourself include:


“I am worthy of love.”
“I will have a fulfilling loving relationship someday.”
“Love is a wonderful thing.”

, Vulnerability is defined as the risk and uncertainty that comes along with emotional exposure. People who fear loving and being loved often have their defenses up in a relationship. If you want to overcome your fear of loving and being loved, you will need to lower your defenses and allow yourself to be vulnerable to your partner. This might sound frightening, but it is an important step to become more comfortable with love. Common defenses against feeling vulnerable include retreating into a fantasy world or presenting yourself in a less than ideal way.Identify the defenses that you use to prevent yourself from feeling vulnerable. What are your defenses? How can you lower them and begin to allow yourself to be more vulnerable?
In your next relationship, try taking the long view — using memories of past happiness as insurance for the future or recalling the original commitment and promises made each other.

, Talking to someone about your fears and feelings may help you to deal with your fears about loving and being loved. If you are in a relationship consider sharing these feelings with your partner. Telling your partner how you feel can open up the possibilities for greater intimacy in your relationship. Make sure that you have this discussion with your partner when you are both calm, not after or during an argument.If you are not in a relationship or if you are not ready to talk to your partner about your feelings, talk to a trusted friend instead.
Try starting by saying something like, “I think my past/current relationship problems were caused by some of my fears about love. I am trying to work through those feelings so that the problems do not continue. Would you be willing to discuss that with me?”

, Sometimes fears related to loving and being love are so severe that you need to get help from a counselor.

"
Define love.,
Feel it.,
Make eye contact.,
Say it at an appropriate time.,
Say it without expecting anything in return.,
Be creative.,
Back up your words.","How to Say ""I Love You""1"," The sincerity of the phrase is strengthened by knowing what love is, and what loving someone means to you. Determine the difference between love, infatuation and lust, and make sure it's genuine love that you feel for this person.;
, There will come a point when you know what you feel for your boyfriend or girlfriend had moved from friendship, to like, through infatuation, and into romantic love. When you're sure you've crossed that threshold, that's the time to express your feelings. If you say it because you think you should, or because it's expected—and you're not there yet—it will come across as insincere.

, Making eye contact not only shows sincerity and communicates trust, it's a delight to look into your partner's eyes when you first say ""I love you."" It will be a moment you will both always remember. Even though there are probably a few inches between your faces, it should feel like there is nothing between yourselves, not even air.


Holding hands as you tell them you love them can also communicate sincerity and trust.

, Time the statement in a way that will make both you and the recipient most comfortable.


If you're in a private place and there's not much background noise, keep your volume low; don't whisper unless you bring your lips to his or her ear, which can also be a very intimate way to express your love.
If you want to tell your partner how you feel when you're in a public place, it's up to you whether you want to pull the person aside or say it in front of friends or even strangers. It depends on your loved one's personality and your own personality. Some will find it terribly romantic to be told they're loved across a room full of people; others may find it mortifying.

, It is nerve-wracking to tell someone that you love them if you're going to wait anxiously for their response. If you truly feel it, then say it with no expectations of a response. Your intention can be to tell the person how you feel, with the hope of making them happy and showing them that they are valued. So say what you feel, and if they love you, too, they'll let you know in their own way and in their own time.

, Say ""I love you"" in another language. Write it into a poem or even a haiku. If you want to be romantic, spell it out with rose petals on the bedroom floor. Write it in code, like a Vigènere cipher. Say it in little ways, like post-it notes in unexpected places, and express it in every way you can.

, Don't just say it, show them that you really do love them. Saying ""I love you"" without showing it is, in a way, a lie. Express your love in action as well as in words.

"
"
Tell your family.,
Say, ""I love you, man.""","How to Say ""I Love You""2"," Sometimes, it gets taken for granted that we love our parents or our siblings, and though they're really important to us, we simply don't use ""those words"" in normal conversation. If that's how you were raised, get over it! Whether or not your family is comfortable expressing their love for each other, be the icebreaker and tell them.


You can tell them during an event—a wedding dinner, Thanksgiving, or just a family dinner. Raise a glass and say something like ""You're my family, and I love you all.""
You can tell them in private, in an unguarded moment. For example, surfing the web for the latest Lolcats hilarity, give your Dad a hug and tell him you love him. It doesn't have to be all gooey and sentimental—just a statement of fact.

, Sure, it's a goofy beer commercial tagline, but the idea is right. For some, saying this is a cultural taboo that is hard to overcome—especially for guys. But the fact is, good friends are like the family we choose, and every now and then, it's a good thing to tell the people that matter to you that you love them. This is true whether they're the same sex or not. Just keep in mind that this is not about romance and sex, this is about friendship.


For example, he's been your best friend since high school. He was there when that boy broke your heart, you were there for him when she went off to college in another country and ended the relationship. You've talked about going beyond friendship, but decided that's not how you felt about each other. You've celebrated milestones together, and even though you live in separate states, you keep in touch regularly. Next time you see him, if you haven't already, say something like ""Danny, you're such a great friend. I totally love you!"" Chances are, Danny feels the same way.
Another example is ""the buds."" Both of you guys were on the team together and have always had a friendly rivalry. You've been there for each other through thick and thin. He's your best bud, and you love him like a brother. After celebrating an event, or when thanking him for something he's done, just say it casually: ""I love you, bro."" Then punch him in the arm if you feel too awkward!
Your BFF is another person to tell. You two have shared secrets, shared crushes, go to parties together, and cry on each other's shoulders. Even when you lived in different countries, you Skype at least once a week, and you'd be lost without her. Just say, ""I love you so much, Buttercup,"" or whatever you like to call each other. She'll say it right back.

There are no rules.","How to Say ""I Love You""3"," Unconditional love is best exemplified by what we usually feel for our children. There is, perhaps, nothing more wonderful than the love we have for them, especially when they are babies. We expect nothing in return, and delight in just seeing them smile. As they grow, they'll challenge us, make us proud, disappoint us, grow, and make mistakes, but we love them regardless.


Another example of unconditional love is how your dog loves you, engendering the statement, ""I strive to be the person my dog thinks I am.""

Take the initiative to help her out.,
Be a creative gift giver.,
Say things that make women melt.,
Use endearments regularly.,
Take her on a romantic vacation.",How to Make Women Melt1," Set aside defined gender roles in your household and distribute the work equally. When you've settled down and made your love nest together, here are some ways to keep the woman in your life melting:



Make her breakfast in bed on the weekend. You can also cook breakfast or dinner for the whole family. If you're not already cooking for the family regularly, start making this a regular routine. Also. know what her favorite foods are. When you go grocery shopping together, add them to the cart as an automatic reflex. You'll send shivers of delight down her spine!
Do things without having to be asked. Take care of the vacuuming, the pets or the pile of dishes in the sink. Repair broken items around the house.
Take care of the kids for a day. Take them out and wear them out so they come home exhausted and don't want to hassle her! Or give her the special delight of arranging an entire day of playing with them and feeding them at home, allowing her to just sit back and enjoy the sound of her children laughing and enjoying themselves all day. This combination that will definitely make her heart melt: you caring for the kids while they are laughing with joy.
Take care of her when she's sick. Make special meals, fetch her mail, fluff up her pillows, rub her back, get the temperature ""just right,"" rent her favorite movies, and if you have kids, tell her not to worry because you're taking care of everything.
When she's tired, run her a warm bath with something scented in the water, or give her a relaxing massage. Carry her to bed if she falls asleep anywhere else.;
, Gifts that are unique and thoughtful in nature are a lovely way to tell her that she's special.


Give traditional gifts in the beginning of the relationship, such as stuffed animals, your sweater or sweatshirt or a piece of jewelry. After you've been together for a while, start coming up with something a little more personalized so that she'll know you're into her.
Have the gift customized. For example, you can inscribe a special message on a mug, T-shirt or bracelet. Then, give her a note card that says, ""I want you to know that I appreciate everything you do. I probably should tell you more. I think you're the complete package. So I'm giving you this bracelet to show how much I appreciate you,"" she'll melt.
Don't just buy the first bundle of flowers that the florist has to offer. Go out of your way to either select flowers that you know she loves or to find less common ones, such as violets or freesias. You can also pick wildflowers and give them to her yourself--she'll definitely melt.
Choose handmade chocolates from a hard-to-find artisan chocolate shop. Or if you're good at it, go all out and make them yourself!
Remember your anniversaries and arrange unique ways to celebrate them. And tickle her pink by mentioning an upcoming anniversary before she does!

, Saying things that make her melt depends on who she is and how well you know her. While you won't find a 1-size-fits-all formula, have a toolbox full of general sweet somethings that you can use until you know her a little better. Here are some of you might like to try:


Acknowledge her sense of humor. Tell her that she makes you laugh.
Ask her, ""How was your day?"" It's surprising how many times people forget this simple nicety. Yet, it means a lot because it gives her an open invitation to talk about herself. Ask specific questions about her job or about her day raising your children.
If you've been apart a few days, tell her you miss her. Something like: ""Can't wait to see you; feels like it's been an eternity since we've been together.""
If things have been flagging a little lately in the romance department, tell her: ""Honey, I want to increase the romance in our lives.""
Tell her there's no one else like her. She's unique, and nobody else in the world is as right for you as she is. Everyone likes being told how special they are. Doing this serves as an especially powerful tonic if she's feeling insecure. When you're getting ready to propose, tell her: ""I cannot wait to spend every moment of my entire life with you.""

, Your own special words for one another are a reminder of the unique love for one another and it's important to continue using these even as your relationship turns into everyday living.


Call her by a pet name. Some of the cute names women like may include kitten, love, sweetheart, sweetie, babe, gorgeous, darling/darlin', princess or a sweet nickname that you came up with on your own.
Tell her that you love her regularly. Few of us tell one another often enough that we love each other. For example, in public, say ""Sweetie, I love you"" loudly enough for people around you to hear, and then kiss her. Or call her or text her for no other reason than to say, ""I love you.""

, Book everything, create a small portfolio of the trip and ask her to ""close your eyes"" and then ""open your eyes and look where I'm taking you"" before placing the itinerary in her hands. If she's a hard worker who worries about time availability, try to clear the vacation time with her boss first.

Tell her how much you appreciate her.,
Compliment her often.,
Respect her body.",How to Make Women Melt2," You can never underestimate the power of appreciating another person for who they are, particularly the special woman in your life. It isn't enough to just say that you're thankful to have her in your life; it's important to spell out why. The details matter because they go to the core of who she is and how her essence is reflected in your eyes.


Notice what she does to help others, including you, and make a comment about how much you value her generosity and kindness. Tell her that you really appreciate her ability to help and care for others.
Pay attention to her appearance changes. Tell her you love her new hair style or her new clothes.
Cherish the little things. Whenever you notice something small that reminds you how much you appreciate her, say it rather than just thinking it.

, One important way of letting her know that you appreciate her is to compliment her. Compliments serve as instant mood-boosters and are an important means for reminding her how much you care about her. Don't compliment her so much that she begins to question your sincerity, but at the same time, don't get into a routine that causes you to forget how much she needs to know that you notice her.


Be specific in your compliments. Instead of making a general remark about how beautiful she is, pinpoint specific aspects of her that amaze you, such as her eyes, her hair or the way she smiles. Singling out a particular reason for why you like or love a person is far more effective than a generalized reason.
Ask questions that are a compliment. For example: ""I love your earrings, they are perfect with your outfit. Where did you find them?"" A question like this shows that you notice, that you think she looks great and that she has good taste.

Be sincere. If your compliments or comments are not meant sincerely, they won't carry a genuine feeling and she'll pick up on this lack of sincerity. Dale Carnegie once said: """"Flattery is from the teeth out. Sincere appreciation is from the heart out."" Therefore, only say things you feel in your heart and believe with all your might.

, Tell her what you love about it. For example: ""Darling, you've got such an incredible body. Are you sure we've had three kids and 10 years together?"" Let her know she is beautiful, but be specific about what you like. Don't simply tell her she's the most beautiful woman in the world because she won't believe that you're sincere.

Listen to her.,
Use touch to make her melt.,
Flirt subtly in public.,
Ask for her help.,
Call her when you're feeling sad or down.,
Be humorous and witty.,
Enjoy each other's company and have fun together.,
Respect her intelligence.,
Demonstrate true friendship.",How to Make Women Melt3," This means really listening, so that you learn about her deepest fears, convictions, desires, and hopes. Remember what she tells you, and occasionally do something that shows you've heard what her deepest wants are.


Always be prepared to listen to her viewpoint. Even if you don't agree, strive to understand what she's saying so that you can reach a compromise. Ask questions that provoke her to say more instead of just asking ""yes"" or ""no"" questions.
Listen without debating, fixing or responding. Avoid disagreeing when she finally trusts you enough to open up to you.

, Remember that non-sexual touch is very important for women and is something you can put into play every day you see one another.


Stroke, rub or simply touch her arms, hands and neck. A simple touch as you go to the bathroom and return again when at dinner together can do wonders.
Stroke her hair. If it's windy, brush the hair out of her eyes and off her face.
Stand behind her, wrap your arms around her and hug her. You can kiss her neck, whisper in her ear or nibble her ears as well. Hold her hips with your hands.
When she rolls over to go to sleep, kiss her in between her shoulder blades. It's an erogenous zone.
Squeeze her hand three times for ""I - love - you.""
Kiss her eyelids, or give butterfly kisses (using your eyelashes) on her cheeks.
When introducing her to your friends and family, put your arm around her. If you're talking to a female friend, pull your woman closer to you. Kiss her hand around your best buddies to show her she's worth it.

Hug her. Hugs are great for cheering her up, for saying hello and for reassuring her if she feels jealous.
Give her random kisses.

, A public show of your affection and love for her is a display of your pride in being with her.


If you spend time looking up generic pick-up lines, sift through them to discard the trite, the lame, the obvious, the inappropriate and the downright silly. You know your woman best – do her a favor by reflecting your love, not your cliches.
Keep flirting throughout the months and years that you stay together. Don't let the spice creep out of your relationship.

, When you ask for her help, you're showing that you trust her enough to let down your masculine guard and show some vulnerability. It's a heart-melting gesture.

, She'll appreciate that you're seeking solace in her love. Alternatively, if you call her on the phone and she's crying, go around and see her rather than trying to cheer her up on the phone alone.

, Humor easily melts a woman's heart because you're demonstrating to her that you can relax easily and see the funnier side of life. A sense of humor shows her that you don't take yourself too seriously and that you're ready for a humorous take on the most challenging issues the 2 of you might face together. Laugh a lot, and keep the warm smiles for her. Whenever she's feeling down, do your best to make her laugh.

, Sometimes it can be tempting to make a relationship too serious in its focus, or to try to be a serious couple in a way you think conforms to societal expectations, thereby deadening the spontaneity in your lives. Always take time to re-inject fun into your time together, no matter how long you've been a couple.


Do what she wants to do,. Spending time doing the things she finds fun is a ready-made way to make her melt. Put aside what you'd rather be doing and indulge her, even if it means seeing a chick flick once in a while.
Take her to your favorite sport. Spend more time talking to her (even it's to explain the sport) than watching the game.
Do crazy things together once in a while to shake things up. Unexpected surprises will thrill her heart!

, Respecting a woman's intelligence shows that you hold her in high personal regard. Put aside the corny pick-up lines, gender jokes or put-downs. Flirt with her intelligence as much as her beauty and sexiness and you'll make her melt.

, True friendship shows that you'll be by her side regardless of your status as partner or lover. Being a friend shows that you're willing to be there through thick and thin, that you're trustworthy and that you trust her with your deepest confidences. Women see friendship as being at the heart of any good relationship, and being her best friend will make her melt.

Pick a specific destination you have always wanted to visit.,
Choose a type of destination.,
Go somewhere that is special to you.,
Use what you know about your partner.,
Stay somewhere local.",How to Plan a Surprise Romantic Getaway1," One way to plan a trip is to decide on the end location first. This could be a country (like Mexico), or a city (like Paris), or even a specific destination (like the Grand Canyon). Try to find a place that you both want to visit, even if you have to compromise a little.If you have a country in mind, you’ll have a lot of options that you can choose from as you research your trip.
It will be more romantic if you both are interested in the destination. If you get a place in mind, try to drop some hints about it so you can see how they feel about it.;
, You may have a certain type of location in mind, but you don’t know about specific options yet. For example, you may decide you want to travel to a ski lodge, and you can compare different options. Or if you just want a warm beach somewhere, you can decide how far away you will need to travel.


With this option, you’ll give yourself a much broader range of destinations. You could go skiing in Minnesota, Switzerland, or China. If you have limited time, you can pick based on where you can travel to quickly.
Once you have a budget in mind, you can use it to narrow down which places are your best options. You can see what type of accommodations are available in the areas you find.

, If you don’t live in the city you met in, you could go back there and relive some of your favorite memories. You could go to a favorite place that you’ve both visited separately and make new memories together.If you already have some specific connection to the place you go for your getaway, you’ll have some romance that already exists in that place.
Maybe your partner moved away from their home when they were young and you could surprise them by planning a trip there. The fact that you care about where they came from will add a romantic aspect to the trip.

, For a successful romantic getaway, you need to go somewhere that your partner will like. If they don’t like nature very much, a cabin in the woods is probably not a good option. If big cities stress them out, their uneasiness will kill the romance.


If you don’t have much experience traveling together, you can casually ask some questions to gauge what places they would enjoy. You can mention somewhere you’d enjoy traveling and see how they respond.
Try to remember places they have mentioned during your relationship. Most people have said, “I would love to travel to ,” at some point, so rely on that. They will be surprised that you remembered and it will be romantic because it gives them something they have wanted.
Your partner may not be a big fan of surprises, so you need to take this into account as well. Maybe you can plan the majority of the trip but tell them a little bit for the departure date so they don’t feel caught off guard.

, You don’t have to go anywhere far away for it to be a romantic surprise. If you go to a local bed and breakfast or ritzy hotel, it can still be romantic. A low-key getaway would most likely involve less planning and therefore less secrecy.


Sometimes the only thing you need to create romance is a change of place. Getting out of your home and daily routine can be a fun way to mix things up.
Local doesn’t have to mean 10 minutes away. If you live in the country, you could head into a larger city somewhere nearby. If you live in the city, you may be able to travel an hour or so away to get to a quieter countryside setting.

See the best in your love.,
Have compassion for your loved one.,
Appreciate the little things.,
Share a 6-second kiss every day.,
Give your partner the affection and attention he or she needs.",How to Make Love Last1," If you want to make love last, then you should focus on your loved one's best qualities -- not their worst qualities. Though you can be honest about your loved one's less-than-ideal qualities, you should focus on his or her ability to make you laugh, their intelligence, and their great smile instead of how they're always late or that they spend too much time on their cell phone.A survey of 470 studies on compatibility revealed that the one thing many long-lasting relationships have in common is ""positive illusions"", which allowed the people in the relationship to see each other in a positive light. This is also known as the ""positive perspective.""
Every day, look for the best in your partner and remind yourself why you are with this wonderful person.;
, It's been proven: couples who exercise compassionate love have happier marriages. To have compassion for your loved one you have to learn how to understand why he or she is upset and to be sympathetic to their needs instead of being annoyed that they aren't in a good mood. Look for opportunities to practice random acts of kindness toward your partner and see how much of a positive impact it makes on your relationship.Make it a goal to surprise your partner with a small gesture once a day. It doesn't have to be complicated or cost a dime; the time you take to send a text or leave a little note to tell them how special they are can mean more than expensive gifts.
When your loved one has had a bad day make it a point to be extra kind by helping him or her out around the house, whether it's by making dinner, doing laundry, or even giving him or her a back massage.

, To make love last, you can't underestimate ""the sliding door moments."" Sliding door moments are the seemingly inconsequential everyday moments filled with the words we haphazardly throw back and forth at each other. They are accompanied by little evanescent pains, frustrations, joys, and laughter, flying through our minds and our hearts that make or break the most important relationships in our lives. These little moments add up.Even if you only have a few minutes of time with your loved one in the morning make it count.

, The six-second kiss is one simple and fun activity you should incorporate into your everyday moments of transition as a couple. This kiss is long enough to feel passionate and romantic, and it can serve as a temporary oasis within a busy day -- for example, when you're going to and from work. Make a goal of sharing this kiss at least once in the morning and once in the evening. You'll see what a difference it makes.


Greeting your partner with affection communicates his or her importance to you while reminding him or her of the good feelings you share when you’re in each other’s company.

, When your partner lets you know that he or she wants an emotional connection, whether he wants to cuddle or briefly step out onto your balcony to look at the stars, try to give him what he needs instead of rejecting him, no matter how busy you are. These moments won't come often, and if you want your relationship to thrive, then you should give your partner the affection he or she needs, so you can get that love and affection in return.Take the time to listen to your partner and to respond to his or her needs thoughtfully.
You can't always give your partner the affection and attention that he or she needs, but you can make a goal to do this much more often.

Clear your schedules.,
Avoid holiday weekends.,
Plan the trip around an event.",How to Plan a Surprise Romantic Getaway2," Taking care of your own schedule should be fairly easy, but the hard part is figuring out how to make sure your partner is free. If you plan the trip for a weekend, you may have less interference from work. If you plan it on short notice, you should be able to find out if they have plans already.A good trick you can use is to get a friend of your partner to make plans with them for the same time that you are planning the trip. Tell the friend that you need them to make fake plans. Your partner should end up keeping their schedule clear.
For example, call your partner’s best friend and say, “Hey, I want to take John on a surprise trip this weekend. Would you make some fake plans with him so he’ll keep the weekend open?”
If you’re planning a multiple day trip, you may only need the fake plans to be for part of that time, as long as your partner keeps the rest of the time open.
If you are willing to give away part of the surprise, you can simply tell them, “I’m making plans for us for this weekend, so keep your schedule open.” It accomplishes what you need, but it does not give the whole surprise away.

, So many people travel around holidays that it can be a little tricky to take your romantic getaway at those times. Tickets and housing can be a little more expensive, and travel can get more hectic. All of this can add some stress to the situation which can easily take away from the romance of your getaway.If you want to make the trip part of the holiday experience, you can plan the trip for a weekend before or after the holiday time.
Sitting in traffic, walking through crowded airports, and dealing with packed hotels will most likely cause stress, not romance. For these reasons, holidays are best avoided.

, A great way to surprise someone is getting tickets to an event they would enjoy. You could pick a concert, a stage play, or a convention of some kind. If you find a fun event, this will determine the date of your trip and you can work the other details out around it.


Most events are scheduled pretty far in advance, so this will help you with planning.
Focusing on an event will also help you narrow down where you’re going to travel.
You could also start with a location that you want to visit and find out what events are going to be in that area. This will most likely give you a good number of specific dates to choose from.

"
"
Plan for the trip’s expenses.,
Budget and save for all of the expenses.,
Pack passports if you are traveling abroad.,
Plan for your dependents.,
Make transportation plans.",How to Plan a Surprise Romantic Getaway3," A romantic getaway will most likely entail a number of different expenses. Planning for these expenses ahead of time will help make it go more smoothly. Your main expenses will be travel, lodging, food, and entertainment.


As you start to plan the trip, take note of how much each part will cost. You need to plan for travel expenses, which could be gas money, bus or plane tickets, or a rental car.
A hotel, cabin, cottage or some other housing rental may be one of the larger expenses. Once you have the destination in mind, you can compare various options based on price. If you specifically want a certain accommodation, you can compare different locations that have that accommodation.
The other main expense will be food and entertainment. On trips, you may have to eat at restaurants for most of your meals. You may plan a vacation package which includes entertainment, or you may need to plan that separately and include those expenses.
It is also possible to take food to cook if the place you are staying has a kitchen you can use, which can save money. You can plan low-cost or free entertainment like parks, museums, sightseeing, or relaxing at the beach.

, Most trips are going to cost at least a couple hundred dollars. If you can save for a month or two, this will make it easier. Spending lots of money can bring tension into a relationship, so being careful about money is important.As you are planning and you determine the range of money you would need for the various trip options, consider your income and what trip options you can realistically afford.
Travel is most likely an unavoidable expense, but you can find ways to reduce the money spent on other options. You could plan for some cheap meals or buying food for sack lunches part of the time.
Talking about money usually isn’t romantic and is one of the biggest sources of tension in a relationship. If you can have a plan for most of the money aspects, you can make it more romantic by not worrying about it during the trip.
If you really want the whole trip to be a surprise, avoid using credit cards for which your partner could see the bill or spending from a joint bank account.

, It seems simple, but in the planning of a big surprise you may end up forgetting your passports. Your trip will be ruined or significantly delayed if you don’t have your passports.


If you have not traveled in a long time, you may need to get passports updated ahead of time.
Your partner may not have a passport, so this is a detail you’ll have to work out. You may be able to casually encourage them to get a passport just in case they need it someday, since you know they will definitely need it.
For example, you could say something like, “I would really like to visit Greece over the Christmas holiday, could we go ahead and get our passports early?” You can use a holiday or specific vacation time that is coming up to revolve the trip around.

, If you have kids or pets, you need to plan ahead for having them taken care of. If kids are teenagers, maybe you can realistically leave them home alone. Pets that can be self-sufficient may be fine for a couple days. Otherwise, you need to find a sitter who can stay at your house or will let them stay at their house.You know your pets, so you know how much attention they need. You may be able to get a friend or family member to stop by your house a couple times a day. If your pet needs more attention, you may need to get someone to stay at your house while you are gone.
For your kids, you may have to pay a sitter to stay are your house. You may also be able to ask a favor of a family member or friend to save money.

, You may be driving yourself to your destination, but if not, you need to make sure to plan specifically how you’ll get there. You may arrange for a driver, buy bus tickets, or purchase plane tickets.


Make sure you make these arrangements well in advance so you ensure you can get to where you need to go.
How far you are traveling will have a significant impact on transportation options. If you are going out of the country, flying is most likely your only option.

Take good care of yourself.,
Make a name for yourself, do something that they will remember and show them that there is so much more to you than just a pretty smile.,
Be kind.,
Show your flaws.",How to Make Someone Fall in Love with You1," Physical appearance plays a huge role in whether or not someone will be attracted to someone else.How well you care for your physical health and appearance is something that people can see right away, so it is worth putting some extra time and energy into while you are trying to attract someone. People will notice if you don’t care for yourself and this may make someone lose interest.


To ensure that you look your best, exercise, eat right, practice proper hygiene and wear clean, flattering clothing.
Don't be afraid to capture attention.;
,


Make sure that your personality shines through and he/her knows about your likes and dislikes. Being passionate about something is very attractive and others will take notice.
Be proud of your accomplishments and confident in your abilities. Confidence is something that people admire, so don’t be shy about what you have accomplished., Treat others the way you want to be treated. It may sound cheesy, but it's true. If you want others to treat you with care and respect, you should start treating others this way, too. People are more likely to fall in love with other people who have great personalities, who are polite, and who are kind to others., Let him or her see how far you’ve come. For example, if you are fit and active now, but you used to be a couch potato, tell the person about your transformation. Revealing some of your past shortcomings to someone will allow him or her to see the real you and appreciate you even more."

Avoid the four most common relationship killers.,
Maintain a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions during conflict discussions.,
Manage the perpetual problems in the relationship.,
Introduce a conflict tactfully.,
Learn to compromise.,
Apologize when you're wrong.",How to Make Love Last2," If you want to effectively manage conflict with your loved one, then you need to avoid the four forms of negativity that are so lethal to relationships that they are sometimes called ""the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"": criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling. After observing a couple for only a few hours, scientists can predict with over 94% accuracy whether they will stay together or get divorced if these negative behaviors are not changed. If you find yourself using any of these approaches toward your partner, decide to do something about it before it erodes your love.Avoid criticizing your partner just to get rid of some built-up resentment. Instead, complain without blame by stating a positive need. Talk about your feelings using I statements and then express a positive need. What do you feel? What do you need?
Avoid having contempt for your partner by building a culture of appreciation and respect in your relationship.
Avoid being defensive, and be open to your partner's comments and suggestions. Don't focus on trying to prove that you're right and work on finding a solution with your partner. Accept responsibility, even if for only part of the conflict.
Stonewalling, or refusing to listen to your partner or to give in to their demands even one bit, is one of the worst things you can do in a relationship. The antidote is to practice physiological self-soothing. The first step of physiological self-soothing is to stop the conflict discussion. If you keep going, you'll find yourself exploding at your partner or imploding (stonewalling), neither of which will get you anywhere.

, This will help you and your partner keep things positive while solving a problem together instead of blaming each other, yelling, or hurting each other through comments you don't really mean. You can maintain this ratio of positivity during an argument by avoiding saying things like, ""You never..."" or ""You always..."" Don't think in absolutes and focus on the positive aspects of the situation, not the negative, if you want to reach a solution.Talk to your partner as if he or she is an equal. Use “I” statements like “I would appreciate it if we…” instead of “you” statements like “You need to…” That way, the problem becomes “our problem,” not “your problem.”

, Even the best relationships have their problems, and not all of these problems can be resolved. To make your love last, you should accept the problems or find a way to manage them instead of constantly fighting over them to no avail. What matters most is not solving these problems, but being positive and open-minded when they are discussed.The goal in your relationship when discussing these types of problems should be to establish dialogue that communicates acceptance of your partner, while demonstrating humor and affection.
Ultimately, what does count is being able to actively cope with the unresolvable problem rather than treating it as a condition of gridlock. Gridlocked conflict discussions only lead to painful exchanges or icy silence.

, Using a ""softened startup,"" or a more tactful technique to bring up a conflict during a conversation, can go a long way in how your partner views the conflict and how easy it will be to resolve it. To introduce a conflict, you should complain about the situation carefully, without blaming the other person in a vindictive, angry manner. This will lead to a more stable, healthy relationship.


For example, instead of saying, ""You said you'd go grocery shopping this afternoon and you completely forgot,"" say, ""I'm really upset that we don't have food in the house right now. I thought we discussed that you would help me out by going shopping this time.""
Make statements that start with ""I"" instead of ""You."" When you start sentences with ""I"" you are less likely to seem (or be!) critical. Blame immediately puts your partner in a defensive position, while ""I ""statements show that you are discussing the impact on your feelings instead.
Avoid eye rolling, crossing your arms, or looking away from your partner. These little angry gestures can make a big difference when a conflict is introduced.

, If you want to make love last, then you have to know that being happy is better than being right. If you're determined to get your way every time you have an argument, then your relationship won't have long-term success. You and your partner should be able to weigh the pros and cons of any decision rationally, and to think about how much the decision means to both of you. In the end, you should be able to satisfy both people instead of just having one person get what he or she wants.


You can also take turns. If you got your way on one big decision, when the next big decision comes around, let your partner decide.
Both people should be willing to compromise in a good relationship. If you end up yielding to your partner because you'd rather avoid the conflict, then you have a problem.

, If you want to make love last, then you should be ready to swallow your pride and to let your partner know that you've made a mistake. Admitting that you're wrong takes courage and will make your partner appreciate your honesty and candor even more. If you know that you are messed up but just want to sweep it under the rug and do better next time, you'll run into trouble down the line.


When you say sorry, you should mean it. Don't just say it because you think it's the right thing to say to make things better.

Make time for romance.,
Take the time to compliment your loved one.,
Take the time to say ""I love you."",
Make the time for fun with your partner.,
Make time to pursue new interests with your partner.",How to Make Love Last3," No matter how long you and your partner have been together, you should make time for romantic moments at least once a week. Have a ""date night,"" where you do nothing but talk, enjoy a nice meal, and see a good movie together. You can also plan more elaborate romantic adventures, such as trips to the beach, long hikes, or a night spent stargazing. Whatever you do, keep it consistent, and make sure that you can spend at least a few hours of quality time with your loved one, when all you want to do is enjoy your love and your relationship.


When you're being romantic, you should really take the time to connect. Talk about your dreams, fears, and goals -- not about who is going to do the laundry or pick up the kids.
You should plug a ""date night"" into your weekly schedule, and make this a sacred event that no visits from friends or work obligations can overrule.

, You may be thinking, ""I've been with my partner for five years -- he or she must know how much I love her by now."" This is logical thinking, right? Wrong. Though you may know in your heart exactly how special your loved one is and how much he or she means to you, you should still let him or her know how much she means to you, and that you appreciate all of his or her unique qualities. Make a goal of complimenting him or her at last once a day with something fresh and meaningful.


Don't take your partner's looks for granted. If you're dressed up for a date, let him or her know she looks nice -- or let him or her know how beautiful they are when they are just watching TV in their everyday clothes.
Let your partner know about all of the things that they have done to improve your life. Saying things like, ""I never could have done this without you,"" or ""I'm so lucky to have you here during this crisis,"" will help your partner know how helpful and supportive they are.
Take the time to let your partner know about all of your favorite aspects of his or her personality, whether it's his or her sense of humor, or his or her ability to charm a new person as soon as he or she meets them.

, You should say ""I love you"" every day to your partner -- and mean it. Don't say it because you're too busy, because you think they should already know that, or because you're in the middle of an argument. You can never say it enough. When you say ""I love you,"" look into your partner's eyes and give them all of your attention to let them see that you really mean it.

, Love isn't all about appreciating each other, managing conflict, and being romantic -- it's also about being fun and even just plain silly. Make the time to do something truly fun with your partner, whether you see a comedian, spend hours telling corny jokes, or go to an amusement park and laugh your heads off. Don't underestimate the positive impact that laughing with your partner can have on your relationship.


It's true: a couple that laughs together stays together. Carve out some time for laughter every day.

, If you want to keep your relationship fresh, then you should take the time to pursue new interests with your partner so everything doesn't feel so ""old hat."" You can take an exercise or dance class together, delve into a collection of classic movies, or travel to a completely new place together. Though developing a routine that makes you happy can help a relationship, making time for new interests or hobbies is equally important so that your relationship can grow.


Taking a salsa class together can make your relationship sexier and more fun.
Start exploring nature together. Taking hikes or walks through pretty scenery together can improve your moods and help you appreciate nature -- and each other.

Don't act like you're not bothered.,
Be emotionally available.,
That this is the one.,
Think about your motives.,
Consider your goals.,
Believe that there are other people.",How to Make Someone Fall in Love with You2," So many people do this. Pretending that you don't care or aren't bothered about the relationship does NOT help and makes the other person feel a burden and this will NOT work.

, Relationships are hard. Before trying to get someone to fall in love with you, be sure that you are ready for one. If you are too hung up on a past relationship, are more interested in dating someone else, or just not ready for commitment, don't try to get someone to fall in love with you., Consider how you feel about this person. Do you love him or her? You will want to be sure that you feel romantic love for the person and not just the love felt between close friends. It can often be difficult to tell the difference. If you don’t love the person yet, then consider slowing things down. If it is meant to be then you will both develop feelings together.

, Think about why you want to be in a relationship. If you only want a person to love you in order to feel better about losing another relationship or to make someone jealous, then getting that person to fall in love with you is a bad idea. This is inconsiderate towards the very real feelings they may end up developing. If you want someone to fall in love with you because you want to be with someone for a long time and have a mutually supportive relationship, then go ahead., Determine your long-term goals for the relationship. If you can't see it lasting, there isn't much sense in trying to make someone fall in love with you. This is emotionally cruel to both yourself and the other person. There is nothing wrong with casual dating; if you want to date someone but don’t see it lasting, just enjoy it for what it is and don’t try to make it more serious. You don’t need to be in love to keep dating.

, Sometimes we have feelings for someone are not returned. This is okay. You shouldn't feel like it's the end of the world or that there's no one else for you. There are an awful lot of people on this planet, after all. If someone doesn't return your feelings you should understand that it wasn't meant to be and that you wouldn't have been all that happy together. You'll find someone else before you know it and wonder why you ever felt upset in the first place.


Don’t try to be someone you are not to get someone to fall in love with you. Make sure that the person you decide to be with is compatible with you as you are."
"
Get to know the person better.,
Share the person’s passions.,
Treat the person like a hero.,
Create trust.,
Support your significant other during difficult times.",How to Make Someone Fall in Love with You3," The first step in getting someone to love you is to get to know the person better and allowing the person to get to know you. Getting to know someone takes time and energy because you will have to ask the right questions and listen well.


Ask about what your love interest wanted to be as a child and what he or she wants to do now. This will tell you about the person’s hopes and dreams, as well as other things that he or she wants to get out of life.
Ask about likes, dislikes, interests, hobbies, and goals.

, Show an interest in the things that your love interest loves and learn to appreciate the things that make him or her happy. Don’t fake your interest because people can often tell when you are not really interested in something. Try to experience the person’s interests through his or her eyes and share in that passion. This will give you something to bond over and put you on the path towards love.


For example, if the person is a big fan of a sport that you don’t know much (or anything) about, ask him or her to tell you more about it or teach you how to play. Or, if the person is really into a certain kind of music, listen to a lot of that music and find some songs that you like too.

, Make your significant other feel like your hero/heroine when they’re around you. Let him or her help you with schoolwork (to make him or her feel smart), ask for personal advice (to make him or her feel wise), and ask for help or advice on subjects that are particularly important to the person (to give him or her a chance to demonstrate expertise). Asking for clothing advice or help reaching or opening containers are also ways that you can make your significant other feel useful and capable., Trust is an essential component in a healthy, long-lasting relationship. Learn to trust your significant other and show that you trust him or her with your words and actions. Make sure that you show your significant other that you are trustworthy as well.If your significant other tells you a secret, keep it. If you find out something that embarrasses him or her, don’t bring it up or tease him or her about it.
Share your secrets with your significant other and reveal parts of yourself that no one else sees. Allow yourself to be vulnerable with your significant other and let him or her comfort you.

, Offering support is very important to creating true love between two people. Most people want to be in relationships to begin with because they like having someone to support them. If you can be supportive and caring to your significant other, this will go a long way towards getting the person to fall in love with you.Sometimes you can support someone by offering to just listen and provide physical comfort. But other times, you may need to do something more. For example, if your significant other is struggling in school, you may need to help him or her study.

Respect your significant other.,
Be a good friend.,
Remember that you are two separate people.,
Embrace your significant other just as he or she is.,
Honor your significant other’s need for alone time and personal space.",How to Make Someone Fall in Love with You4," Respect is important in a loving relationship. Always give your significant other a chance to speak and have an opinion, and when he or she talks, make sure that you listen. Respecting your significant other also means never giving him or her a reason to think that you're unfaithful. It's fun to flirt with other people, but if they see you flirting with everyone who walks down the street then they're never going to want to commit to you., You should give your significant other the same consideration you would give a good friend. This means that you should always be there for them and be unselfish in your actions. But be a good friend to your significant other because you want him or her to be happy, not because you want something from them.

, No one wants to feel trapped in a relationship. This is why many people keep themselves from getting too serious. If you give your significant other the freedom to do the things he or she loves, you will go far in making the person feel comfortable with the idea of loving you. Respect your significant other’s independence; don’t try to change them and certainly don’t invade their privacy. They are allowed to have secrets and things that are just theirs.

, Celebrate the good things about your significant other and try to accept the things that annoy you. Don’t try to get your significant other to change for you.For example, don’t force your significant other to change his or her diet or personal style. If you make suggestions along these lines and he or she says “no”, respect that and don’t bring it up again.

, Alone time and personal space are important for both of you, so don’t try to make your significant other give up his or her personal time to spend more time with you. Be respectful of your significant other’s personal space as well and don’t try to rearrange your significant other’s room or go through his or her things.


Do things on your own or with your friends a couple of times each week. Don’t force your significant other to spend every waking moment with you or he or she may feel suffocated.

Appreciate your significant other.,
Spend quality time together.,
Keep things exciting.",How to Make Someone Fall in Love with You5," Don't ever take the person for granted. If someone falls in love with you, you’ll need work to maintain that love. The best way to keep someone in love with you is to never, ever take the person for granted. Show the person that you appreciate him or her every day.For example, say thank you when your significant other does something nice for you. Make sure that the “thank you” is sincere and specific. For example, “Thank you for putting away the dishes and making coffee this morning! That made my morning so much easier! I really appreciate it.”

, Just because you’re both in love and your relationship seems stable and at its peak doesn’t mean you should stop putting in an effort. Continue to go on dates, buy each other flowers, and things like that. This will show your significant other that you still care and are still invested in the relationship.Most importantly: tell your significant other “I love you” every day.

, Don’t just do the same things you always do. Routines can be nice, relaxing, and even comforting but it’s important to break out every now and again and do something new and exciting together. This shows your significant other that there are still things to look forward to in the relationship and that their lives won’t stagnate by being with you. It can also help recapture some of the excitement associated with first falling in love.Do something daring like skydiving or rock climbing. Take up dance classes or learn to paint together.
Learn something new together, like furniture building, which can be used to fill your living space with things you create together.
Try introducing a board game night, which will give you the chance to have fun together and indulge your competitive sides.

Find someone that's right for you.,
Set up a date.,
Be a great date.",How to Make Someone Fall in Love with You6," Finding the right person will increase your chances of being able to fall in love, be loved, and stay in love. The person you choose needs to be ready for a serious relationship, able to cope with the emotional stress of a relationship, and compatible with you. If the person does not meet these requirements, then you will be wasting your time and you may end up getting hurt.Think about your compatibility: do you enjoy the same things? Do you have the same goals in life? People that make good couples tend to be kind of the same in terms of how they handle drama and what they prioritize in their life.

, To set up a date, don't beat around the bush: be straightforward and specific. Suggest a concrete activity that is entertaining for both of you and be honest about why you want the person to come. Taking control of the situation like this shows that you are confident, which is an admirable quality.Tell your special someone something like, ""Hey, I'd really like to go to the zoo this weekend and I would love it if you'd be my date.""

, From the very first date, you want to be someone that's fun to be around. Even before your date you will want to create opportunities to spend time together in a way that shows just how wonderful you are.


Choose date activities that will be fun for both of you. If you don't know each other very well, choose something that will give you and your date something to talk about: like a movie. If you do know each other well, choose something that's outside the norm for both of you. This may allow them to see you in a new light
Try a thrilling date, such as an action movie or a trip to an amusement part. These activities have been shown to increase feelings of attraction between two people."

Show that you care about your appearance and health.,
Smile well and often.,
Make frequent eye contact.,
Wear soft textures to attract his touch.",How to Make a Man Fall in Love with You1," By putting time and energy into your physical appearance, you will demonstrate to your man that you value your looks and good health. You will also feel more confident about yourself if you feel healthy and strong, and confidence is always attractive.Stay active by going to the gym regularly. Don't skip your workout to spend time with him. Invite him to join you or take a rain check.
Keep your hair clean and styled neatly, and pay close attention to your personal hygiene.
Put on a little signature scent in the morning or before you go out, or wear scented body lotion for a subtler scent.
If you wear makeup, aim for a look that's flattering but simple; don't try to overdo this aspect.
Brush your teeth twice daily, floss, and use mouthwash. During the day, use mints or gum to freshen your breath.
Do your laundry regularly. Instead of buying a new wardrobe, make the best of what you have. Set up a regular schedule and make sure you always have clean shirts, pants/skirts, undergarments and socks available. Don't let him see stains or unkempt clothing!;
, Your best weapon is always available, completely free, and can't be overused—your winning smile! Flash a genuine grin as often as possible, whether it's directed at your guy or not. It makes you look approachable, and it might actually make you happier.Find something to smile about. If you're a bit blue, think of a happy moment or amusing joke to spark a smile. Do you have a favorite pet? A favorite memory? Whatever it is, think of it as often as you need to.
Try a slow smile. If you've made eye contact with the man you love, smile at him slowly, letting it spread over your face. If you tend to blush and look down when he's looking at you, let it happen after the smile — you'll be irresistible.

, Making eye contact is a crucial component of flirtation and it can also increase his feelings of attraction for you. Gaze into his eyes when he is talking to you and don’t be afraid to lock eyes with him even if you are both silent.If you are too nervous to gaze into his eyes or you don't think it is appropriate yet, use quick glances to make frequent eye contact with him. By looking at him for a moment and then looking away, you can show him that you are interested and see if he is interested too.

, Studies suggest that people find soft and pleasant textures pleasing and soothing.Try wearing clothing made from microfiber, silk, faux fur, or other soft textures that he'll want to touch. This will make your guy associate these pleasant sensations with being around you.Try wearing red to catch his attention. The color red has been shown to increase feelings of attraction and passion in both men and women. Try wearing a red dress, a red top, or some red lipstick to make him notice you."

Emphasize your similarities.,
Demonstrate your independence.,
Be kind and considerate.,
Show him what makes you special.,
Be a positive force in his life.",How to Make a Man Fall in Love with You2," Part of the reason why people feel attracted to each other is due to a sense of connection. If you have things in common with him, emphasize those things in your conversations. For example, if you both love a certain type of music or band, talk to him about it. Just make sure that you do not overemphasize or lie about things you have in common. Doing so may cause him to see you as desperate or dishonest.

, Being clingy and dependent on someone else for your happiness are not attractive qualities. Instead, try to show him that you are an independent, strong woman. Showing him that you have a great life and that you don’t need someone else to be happy will intrigue him. Keep your plans with friends and family and turn him down for dates now and then so that he knows that you have your own life., Being rude to the guy or other people is a quick way to make him lose interest in you. Be polite and kind to the guy you have your eye on and show that you are also kind to others. Demonstrating your kind personality will increase his affection for you.

, Letting a guy see what makes you such a catch is another great way to increase his affection for you. It will intrigue him and make him want to get to know you even better. For example, if you are skilled at playing an instrument, look for an opportunity to play in front of him. Or, if you are an excellent baker, whip up some cookies and share some with him., Most people can manage to be negative all by themselves, so they're drawn to people who focus on the bright side of things. Instead of focusing on what's wrong with your life or talking about the people who annoy you, try to emphasize what's right. Moreover, be pleasant in all that you say toward him and avoid gossiping. Be a positive person in his presence and aim to be positive in general.This isn't to say that you can never complain around him. Everyone complains. But it can be exhausting to listen to someone gripe constantly. Try to keep a rein on it so that he feels warm and fuzzy about his time with you, not tired and down.

"

Maintain a balance.,
Make him feel needed.,
Act casual.",How to Make a Man Fall in Love with You3," In the beginning of a relationship, it is important to spend lots of time together. During this time, you are just getting to know each other and spending time together should be fun. Don’t fight this urge to spend lots of time with him when you are just starting out, but know when to pull it back. The ""scarcity principle"" suggests that people are more likely to want and value something that's a bit hard to get.This doesn't mean you have to play mind games with your guy, but make sure that you're not available at the drop of a hat every time he calls. Maintain a good balance between spending time with him and spending time on your own.


To get some time away from him, make plans with your friends and family, spend more time alone, or work more to have some time away from him.
This strategy may seem odd, but it will be good for both of you. It will give him some time to think about his feelings and it will also give you a chance to think about your feelings. Having some time apart will help the two of you avoid getting bored with each other or taking each other from granted.

, Doing things to make your guy feel needed may increase his feelings of affection for you. Asking him to help you with something or even just asking for his advice can make him feel needed and important. For example, you might ask him to help you move some furniture in your bedroom or ask him to help you make a decision about your car insurance., Remember: you can't actually make him fall in love with you. He's free to choose what he wants. Beyond that, though, people can't always control who they love. If it's simply not there on his end, resist the temptation to punish him for it. Accept that if the relationship is meant to be, it will happen; if not, then you're meant for something better.


Avoid using the ""girlfriend"" term until he has said it first. If you say it too prematurely, he may run and never look back. Even more importantly, avoid all talk of marriage and babies––that will definitely scare him away.

Talk about how certain situations made you feel or how you would like to see some things happen differently.


When you communicate with your partner, try to frame things positively. For example, if you did not like that your partner said you would attend their work event without asking, instead of saying “Don’t make my decisions for me,"" say something like, “I love to support you in your job, however I would really appreciate it if we could discuss going to social events before you RSVP.”

, On a first date, you make a significant effort to impress. If you strive to look your best and be on your best behavior each time you go on a date with your partner, you will both feel happier and more satisfied., Leave your home for two days a month and visit a place you have never gone with your partner. You can plan the getaway or make it spontaneous. Throw a dart at a map and go to wherever it lands.

Try to just change your setting as much as possible. By being with your partner in a different environment, you may see them in a different light.
Going on trips can also test your relationship by revealing your compatibility, showing how you manage each other when you are together 24/7., Taking time for yourself in a relationship is a healthy step because it promotes independence and adds mystery into your lives. If you love going to art museums but your partner does not, going on your own can encourage self-love, which will be carried into your relationship.Have a “girl’s or boy’s night” and hang out with your own group of friends. You can talk about things you wouldn’t necessarily discuss with your partner, and you will be reminded of yourself as an individual, instead of yourself in a partnership.

, An old-fashioned picnic basket will add to the overall experience.You can find them at most home goods stores, or you can buy them online. If you really want to be authentic, you can visit antique shops for one.


If you can’t find a basket in time, try using a nice looking cloth or tote bag.
Avoid packing your stuff in a backpack or box because it will take away from the romance.

, Plastic utensils come off tacky and cheap so avoid using them unless you’re on a budget. Even if you’ve brought finger food, remember you may need a knife to apply spreads or to cut cheese.


Bring a zip-lock bag so you can put dirty utensils in it after you’re done.
Your silverware does not have to be expensive, just make sure it’s visually appealing.

, For an extra special touch, you can serve regular or nonalcoholic champagne in champagne flutes. While crystal flutes are the most formal, glass or even plastic ones are more appropriate for a special picnic.


If you do use breakable glasses, keep them wrapped in cloth or a towel during transportation.
Stemmed or stemless wine glasses could be nice alternatives to champagne flutes.

, Your blanket should be big enough so you can both sit on it. Avoid white blankets since they can easily stain. Some blankets have a waterproof side which make them perfect for wet grass.


If it has recently rained you can bring a shower curtain lining to put under your blanket to prevent you from getting wet.
Down comforters are filled with the undercoating of goose and duck, and are softer than synthetic blankets., Picnics usually leave a lot of waste, and you don’t want to destroy the beautiful environment that you just enjoyed. In addition, your date might not find it attractive that you litter if they’re an environmentalist.


Littering fines are different in different states, but can be anywhere from $1,000 in fines or community service.

, It’s not romantic to have a conversation when there’s something on your mouth. Because a lot of the food you brought is eaten with your hands, it could get messy.


For a more classy experience, cloth napkins are a good alternative to your typical disposable ones.
Paper towels also work.

, It’s easy to be romantic if your date is in a location that they already like. Do they like the woods and being around nature or would they rather be on the beach? Do they like the warm weather and being in the sun or are they the type of person who prefers shade? Take all of these things into consideration before picking your location.


The wrong location will destroy the mood.
Make sure that you tell your date before hand so they can dress appropriately for the location.

, Try to find a bigger park that has wide open spaces. You probably want to set the picnic up in a field, so avoid overly wooded areas. Think of places where the weather would be comfortable.


National parks often have fees associated with entering ranging from $40 to $60.Make sure to check the park's rules to make sure you can bring everything you want on your picnic.

, If your date doesn’t like the woods, you can opt to go somewhere else. If they like the sand and ocean, then the beach is a great place to have a picnic. If the beach isn’t their thing, then finding a garden, or just a wide open space outside is a good location for your romantic picnic.


A secluded area is the best for a romantic picnic.Make sure to cover your food when on the beach or else sand will get in your food.
Some places restrict the consumption of alcohol.

, Rain can ruin a picnic, so make sure you check the weather forecast before making any final plans. If there’s a big chance of rain, don’t risk it. Pick a different day that’s convenient for both of you. The weather will also determine what kind of foods compliment the picnic.If there’s a slight chance of rain, make sure to bring umbrellas.
Rain isn’t the only thing that can ruin the romance. Extreme heat or humidity can also ruin the romance.

, It may increase the romance if you plan your picnic around sunset, but make sure that you have enough time with your date before it gets really dark. Factor in how long it’ll take you eat and how much conversation you will have. Time flies when you’re having fun, so make sure to keep an eye on it.You’ll also need to make sure that the picnic coordinates with the other person’s schedule.
Leave enough time for any unexpected delays.

Offer a few different days to set up a date, this will show them that you're willing to plan around their schedule.Simply asking “Are you free Wednesday or Thursday?” gives options, while still being direct. This will show your date that you respect their time, but can still handle making plans.
Asking your date if they'd prefer to go out on a weeknight or weekend is also a great way to show that you're flexible and want to see them on a day that works best for their schedule.;
, Once you've picked a day, offer a few vague suggestions for your date to choose from. This will show them that you care about their interests and that you're going out of your way to make this date perfect.


Ask your date ""Would you rather have a relaxing night or get a little adventurous?"" or ""Would you rather we have an indoor or outdoor date?"" Their answer will point you in the right direction for your planning.
Don't be too specific when giving your date options. Keep some of your plans as an element of surprise.

, To plan the perfect date, you need to make sure that you solidify your plans. Whether you're going to a restaurant, going mini golfing, going sky-diving, or going to a concert, don't leave your date to chance. Call in advance to ensure that you get tickets, make reservations, etc.Some restaurants don't take reservations, and some activities won't require tickets. If this is the case, it's important that you come up with a backup plan for your date just in case your initial plans don't pan out.

, Sometimes, plans can fall through. One of you may be running late because of work, or maybe you got stuck in traffic. Whatever date you have planned, always have a simple backup plan just in case things go wrong. Even if your backup plan is your favorite local coffee shop, or hanging out at your favorite view of the city you live in, it's always good to have another idea in your back pocket.Make two dinner reservations at nearby restaurants – one at 6pm and one at 6:30, for example. If you happen to be running late for your first reservation, you'll have another reservation at a restaurant that's nearby. This will make a great impression on your date, as it will be obvious that you've thought this date through.

, Give your date an idea of what you'll be doing so that they can dress appropriately and be prepared. More adventurous dates may require some athletic clothing, fancier dates may require a dressier attire. Give your date at least a day in advance so that they don't feel rushed or unprepared.For example, if you're planning on going hiking, give your date a heads up to wear sneakers and comfortable clothing. High heels and hiking aren't a good time.
If you plan on going to an opera, tell your date to have fun getting dressed up for a romantic night on the town. If they're underdressed for something like the opera, they may feel uncomfortable, resulting in them not enjoying the date.

, If your date goes tremendously well, neither of you will want it to end. Pick a fun place to have drinks or coffee, just in case you'd like your date to continue. Ideally, you should choose a location near your date's home. This will show that you've considered their time and are not trying to pressure them to stay out longer than they'd like to.Instead of picking an actual location, offering to take a walk or go for a scenic drive is a great option to spend more time with your date.
Your date may offer for you to come back to their place – that's perfectly fine! However, it's important to let your date make that suggestion, otherwise you may come off a bit pushy.

, Traditional movie dates can be fun, but they don't allow you to interact with one another. Going to the movies is appropriate for a casual date – but the perfect date should be a bit more creative. The best dates allow people to really get to know each other and spend time with one another, so choose activities that will allow you and your date to communicate.Choosing the movies for a date isn't a bad idea, it's just not the perfect idea. Putting some creativity into your plans will show your date that you've made an effort to show them a great time.
Movies can be fun if you go to a local film festival, or go see a cult classic at a local theater. If you're totally set on going to the movies, make it an interesting experience.

, Instead of going to a regular restaurant, make your dinner experience fun. It's easy for people to bond over food, so make an adventure out of your dining experience to make it even more memorable.Take a cooking class together. Cooking together can be fun and delicious, so look up local cooking classes in your neighborhood.
Go on a mini-tour of restaurants and eat a different course at each one. This is a great way to turn dinner into a fun date night adventure. Start with appetizers at one restaurant, get dinner at another, and end the night at an amazing dessert shop.
Try out food trucks in your neighborhood. Instead of the traditional restaurant experience, check out the local food trucks in your city. This is a fun way to learn more about your neighborhoods and communities while eating delicious food.

, If your date is up for a little fun, try a fun new experience together. There are tons of activities to try, so why not try these new activities together? Sharing new experiences creates amazing memories and conversation, and a perfect date is a date that is never forgotten.Go bungee jumping, try rock-climbing, or hit the water for some kayaking. These are super adventurous dates that will never be forgotten.
If your date is up for a fun time that's not too extreme, try mini golf and go-karts.

, If your date is into the arts, there are tons of fun date ideas that will allow the two of you to get creative. Try taking a BYOB painting class, sign up for an improv comedy class, or go do karaoke. Keep things light and fun, and pick something that will allow you two to laugh together.


Make sure your date doesn't feel the pressure to be good at any of these things. Emphasize that these activities are all for fun.If your date enjoys the arts but doesn't want to actually participate in an artsy activity, try going to an art gallery or a concert. Pick an activity that will still allow the two of you to interact.

, If your love interest leads a busy life, they'll sometimes want to do something a bit more relaxing for their perfect date. (This is why you should get an idea of what they want to do before planning your date). Whatever you decide to do, pick a plan that will allow your date to relax and have an enjoyable, stress-free time.If your date wants to unwind, bring a blanket and a bottle of wine for stargazing in the park. This will make for a nice and relaxing evening while still giving you a chance to get to know each other. Bring a telescope if you have access to one so that the two of you can see all of the stars.
Plan a lazy Sunday brunch date instead of Friday night dinner. This takes away the pressure of a fancy dinner date.

, When dressing for the perfect date, wear something that makes you feel attractive and comfortable. The better you feel, the better you'll look. Don't wear something that's extremely uncomfortable just because it looks good, as your date will be able to sense that you're uncomfortable. Dress appropriately for your date – dressier for a fancy date, and more casual for a fun date.


If you're going out on a fancier date, break out your favorite dress and heels, or your favorite blazer.
If you're going on a fun, adventurous date, wear your go-to jeans, your favorite boots or sneakers, and a cute shirt or jacket. Wearing clothes you love will make you feel more comfortable., Do your very best to be on time. If you're late, your date may think that you're blowing them off or that you don't care enough about them to be on time.Of course, things happen in life, and you could end up running behind schedule. If this is the case, give your date a quick call or text to apologize for running late, and give them an honest timeframe of when they should expect you.
Confirm the time of your date earlier in the day. This will ensure that the two of you are on the same page, and your date will appreciate that you are confirming plans.

, This might seem like a given, but it's very necessary if you want your date to be perfect. Show your date that you're paying attention to them by actually listening when they speak and engaging in meaningful conversation.


Compliment them on something they're wearing or how they look, and be genuine. Instead of saying ""You look nice,"" say ""You look beautiful. The color red looks amazing on you!"" Being specific with your compliments will show them that you're paying attention.
Don't go overboard with the compliments, but make an effort to show your date that you notice the effort they put into getting ready for the date., You planned the date, so you should pay. If you ask someone on a date and you make the plans, do not expect them to pay their way. They may offer to go dutch on the bill for your date, but you should insist on paying.Don't show off how much you're paying for the date. It may come off like you're showing off or bragging, so it's best to be more discreet when paying the bill.
If your date involves an activity where tipping is involved, leave a good tip (15%-20%). This will impress your date.
If your date seems bothered by you paying, let them know that you're more than happy to foot the bill. Express that you invited them out and you want this date to be your treat.

, When you've found someone you really like, you'll want every date to be perfect. Discuss other date ideas that you and your love interest would like to try, and make plans to do them. Having an open conversation about future date ideas is also a great way to show you if this person is truly interested in you.Ask what kind of date they'd like to go on next. If they're unsure, give them options again. For example, ask ""Would you like to do something adventurous next weekend? I know of some amazing hiking trails and mountain climbing spots."" (You can pick your own activities, of course).
Or if you don't want to go the adventurous route, say ""I'd love to see you again next week. Are you free to grab lunch or dinner?"" This shows them that you're flexible to their schedule, and they'll appreciate you giving the options.

, Ending your date with a goodnight kiss isn't always in the cards for a first date, so it's important to pay attention to the verbal or physical cues from your date. For example, if your date steps closer when saying goodbye, leans in during your parting conversation, or lingers while giving you a goodbye hug, these are all signs for a goodnight kiss.


If your date keeps their distance while saying goodbye, or seems in a rush, these are signs that they're not interested in a goodnight kiss. Some people tend to move slower than others when it comes to intimacy, so this does not necessarily mean that your date doesn't like you.
A first kiss is normally brief and tongue-free, as this shows your date that you like and respect them. If they initiate further intimacy, you can follow their lead."

Before the date


Schedule day and time that will work for both of you.,
The Date


Don't be late.,
After the date/at work


Don't talk about your date
at the office...
...especially if that may get to your boss.",How to Plan an Early Morning Date,"
The fact that you schedule your date in the morning almost always suggests it is not your day off or the weekend. So, make sure that although it is a work day, no important presentations, meetings or tests are coming. You'd better not risk having your date and/or your business arrangement ruined.


Find the right coffee shop.
One of the most difficult parts of this plan is finding the right place for your date. If it is a first or second date, you would probably prefer to have it over a cup of coffee. Unfortunately it is almost impossible to find a quiet place at that time of the day. So you should look for a smaller bakery or coffee house in advance or if possible, make a breakfast reservation at your favorite place. Another approach would be to arrive earlier and pick coffee for both of you to drink in the park after the other party arrives.

Pick a smart outfit.
Men are really lucky here. The business outfit only makes them look more attractive. Women, however, have to be more careful. It is perfectly normal to want to look stunning on your date, especially because the morning light is the most unflattering type there is. On the other hand, if it is a work day, you cannot wear your favorite short skirt and top or a cocktail dress. So you have to find a way to make your business outfit date-appropriate. Accessorise it with a stylish scarf, tastefully chosen jewelry and a matching bag. Do your hair using some styling product and put make up on (foundation, rouge and mascara should be enough) Do not overdo your appearance, no one expects you to look absolutely perfect before lunch.;
, Getting ready for a date is not a usual morning activity. However, make sure you arrive on time, especially if you were the one arranging the date at that time. It is stressful enough that you will have limited time and a work day ahead of yourselves. You can always read a paper or listen to some music if you are too early.

Be a sunshine.
This is a date like any other so make sure it goes smoothly, at least from your part. Do not yawn, complain or talk too much about work. Instead make a joke (for example how at this rate soon people will have to arrange their dates while grocery shopping or car washing) and have fun. Being easy-going is always appreciated in the dating business.

, They might take it as a sign that you literally put your romantic affairs before your work. And besides, it is your personal life after all. Keep it private so that you don't have to deal with mean office gossip.

Focus on your tasks.
It's absolutely amazing if your date went great despite the unusual circumstances. But try to forget it at least until lunchtime otherwise you risk decreasing your productivity and looking absent-minded or unprepared. Turn off your personal phone so that you don't be tempted to text your best friend or, even worse - your sweetheart(:

Pick a time and date.,
Invite your partner or surprise them.,
Think about your partner’s preferences.,
Decide whether you would like to go out or stay in.",How to Plan a Romantic Evening1," Get an early start by looking ahead and planning in advance. People get busy and schedules get filled up, so it is best to start planning at least a month ahead of time. This is especially important if the romantic evening is for an anniversary or other special occasion. Begin considering activities and thinking about special moments that your partner will enjoy.;
, Look at both of your schedules and find a good day. If you know that your loved one is exhausted during the workweek, plan it for the weekend instead. To ensure you will both be free for your romantic evening, make sure to mark it on both of your calendars., Decide whether you want the evening to be a surprise for your partner, or if you would like them to know about it ahead of time. If you would like them to know, you can simply invite them by saying something like, “I was thinking we could do something special for our anniversary. Would you like to go out for a special evening?”If you would like to surprise your partner, you can have a friend help you and schedule a fake outing for that day so that your partner won’t have anything else going on. For example, your friend could plan an activity with you and your partner on that same day and then cancel at the last minute, ensuring your partner’s availability without giving away your romantic plans.

, Make sure that this evening will be about your partner. Think about what he or she likes, including food, places, and activities. This will help you to plan a memorable evening that your partner is sure to enjoy.You could make a list of some of your partner’s favorite things and find a way to include them in your evening. For example, if your partner loves nature, you could make sure that your romantic evening includes a walk on the beach.

, Note that there are two types of romantic evenings. The first type is to do something special at home and the second type is to plan an evening out. Both can be great for a romantic date with your loved one. To make this decision, consider whether your partner generally enjoys going out or staying in. You want them to be comfortable.


Staying at home is a good choice so that you will have privacy and not be distracted by other people.
Going out is a good choice because it can make for a special evening by doing something out of the ordinary.

If this isn’t an option, choose a place that serves the kind of food your partner enjoys, like a French restaurant. It should be some place that is fancier than where you would normally eat, but you don’t have to pay hundreds of dollars. You should be able to get a quality dinner for two that costs under $100, but if you want to splurge on something extra fancy, you can do that too.


If you are trying somewhere new, read reviews first to make sure that people had a good experience there. You could look on Yelp to see how other people liked the restaurant.
Look for a place with a romantic ambiance rather than a family-style dining place. It should be a restaurant where you will be able to talk and that has a good tone, like candlelit tables and tasteful artwork on the walls.

, This is important so that you are sure they will be able to seat you that night. It will also keep you from having to wait for a very long time at a busy place. Simply call the restaurant ahead of time and tell them when you need the table reserved.

, Besides sharing a romantic meal with your loved one, you can plan something for after dinner. You could take your partner out dancing or to a jazz club or to a movie or to live theatre. Think about the activities your partner enjoys and the interests your partner has and choose a special event for after you eat.


Depending on where you go, you may need to buy tickets in advance.
You could also keep it low key and simply take a moonlit walk together.

, If you wish to spend the night with your partner out of the house, book a hotel room. Try to find some place nice, and be prepared to spend at least $100, perhaps even $300 depending on the city you are in. It doesn’t need to be a 5-star hotel, but look for one that is tasteful and elegant, perhaps something like a Marriott., If you wish, you could buy your partner a gift to show your affection. Flowers, jewelry, and chocolate are always a good bet. You could get something more personal like a picture frame with a nice photo of the two of you. You could even make a gift, like a CD of romantic songs. Getting your partner a gift is a nice touch that they will surely appreciate.

, Make sure to wear something special to look your best for your partner. Depending on where you go, guys could wear a nice suit and girls could wear a knee-length dress. Dressing well helps make the evening special and your partner will appreciate the effort you put into looking your best."

It is elegant and requires very little preparation.Don’t plan any meal that will be too heavy or you won’t feel very romantic afterwards. The same goes for spicy foods.

, You could choose a nice bottle of wine for dinner, like a Tempranillo from La Rioja, or even a fun cocktail, like a Tom Collins. A bottle of Champagne can be very romantic. For something non-alcoholic, you could go with sparkling water, sparkling grape juice, or fresh squeezed juice. Having a fancy beverage will help the night feel special., Choose something that your partner will enjoy. You could have a fondue-style dessert and dip strawberries in melted chocolate. This requires very little preparation, is delicious, and is something special that you wouldn’t do every day. It’s these special touches that will make your romantic evening memorable.

, Take into account your partner’s preferences, but choose something that is light and have it playing quietly in the background. You could play some smooth jazz, like Billie Holiday, to set the tone.You could make a playlist or stream music, just make sure there won’t be any commercials, which will damper the ambiance.

, Lighting is a big part of a romantic evening. It also shows that you made special effort. You could dim the lights and have a candlelit dinner and then sit by the fireplace for desert or drinks.Just make sure to use caution when dealing with open flames. There is nothing less romantic than setting your house on fire!

, Besides eating and conversing, have something else planned. Maybe you could watch a movie together, like The Princess Bride, or you could plan a romantic massage.

Go for a ride in the car and don’t stop till you find a place where buildings can’t obstruct the view of the sky and city lights can’t outshine the stars. Another idea is to spend a night in the beach; just you and him, sitting around the fire and drinking wine. Check your local laws before doing this. A night in jail for breaking the open container laws is not romantic.;
, There are so many events going on in your town that even if you’d like to catch them all, you wouldn’t have the time! Instead of reading reviews about exhibitions, find out where the next comic festival, book presentation, music concert or poetry reading is gonna be!

, Or go to the nearest hill to have your picnic there. Being spontaneous will improve the fun.

, Try be fun and outgoing. The classic way to have fun with your boyfriend if you decide to go out is to go for a hot cup of coffee in a cozy cafe at the corner, or somewhere you’ve never been before. If you’d like to combine chin wagging with a good meal, choose a restaurant where you could taste different cuisines. You should also experience the night-life of your town once in a while. Dance the night away in a club, or enjoy your drink while listening to your favorite music in a bar!

, Go to the movies at least twice a week. There are always new movies out that will let you share a good laugh, or give you new things to talk about. Invigoration is the source of a good relationship!

(Not that kind of amateur movie… that’s in a different article!)

, You can watch a chick flick and promise to watch a movie of his choice. But you can still keep it engaging for him by snuggling up to him. You can place your hand on his chest to remove all touch barriers. You can always slip your hand underneath his shirt but it might send the wrong signal so be open to anything he might try. But keep it fun by switching things up. Also stop to kiss him once in a while it will send him in a whirl!

, Want to combine fun with exploring new lands and meeting new people? It’s recommended to go on a trip at least one a year. Let this trip be a road trip! As soon as you wake up in the morning, make your suitcases (remember to take as less things with you as possible) and get in the car.

, This will be fun! It will bring out his competitive side which is always fun to watch. It might bring out some funny and embarrassing stories from both of your childhoods. And you can always give a reward such as a kiss in the end for the winner.

If you accidentally do this, look at her right in the eyes and tell her she looks ""so pretty"". (if you have been on a date with her before, beautiful is okay, but if you already have said it right when you saw her at the door, then saying in the middle of a date is weird.

, Don't talk about one thing the whole date, unless you know that she is very interested on the subject. Don't only talk about  yourself.

Communicate any important details to your date.,
Consider splitting the planning.",How to Pick a Good Place to Go on Your First Date1," Your partner won't enjoy the date if it seems thoughtless or impersonal. Consider if he/she wants an involved active date or would rather do something passive, like watch a movie.

Share a meal.,
See a movie together.",How to Pick a Good Place to Go on Your First Date4," If you really want to talk and learn about your date, get coffee or a drink.

Take care with how you smell.,
Have clean breath.",How to Prepare for a First Date and Find Great Things to Do1," This seems like a simple step, but it is commonplace to hear: His after shave was so overpowering, or his deodorant smelt so cheap. Another complaint is smelling sweaty.


Men: Throw away the deodorant sprays and invest in roll-on deodorant. Not only will you not be overpowering and cheap smelling, your body odour will be better and will last the whole night, no matter how much you perspire.
Ladies: Do the same. Don't believe in all those sexy ads. If it's your time of the month, purchase some dermatological and gynaecological tested spray deodorant for intimate hygiene.;
, Even if you have brushed your teeth, never take it for granted that your breath is fine, so keep breath mints on hand. Don't use chewing gum, as there is nothing more off putting than someone chewing all the time. Besides if you are going for a meal, what are you going to do with the gum at mealtime? Most people don't know what they look like when they are chewing gum, so do yourself a favour and don't do it.

Be aware that most women don't realise that they dress to impress other women; they think that it's to impress men but it's in fact for other women.,
Realise that men don’t see the same in women's dress as other ladies do.,
Be ready for being summed up instantly.",How to Prepare for a First Date and Find Great Things to Do2," Just think about it. Ladies, who do you criticise mostly about clothing, weight, and makeup? Say no more.

, Sure, men look at figure, and clothing, but men primarily respond through their five senses. Men don't want to date the sexy girls on Playboy; in any case, men don't know how to react around beautiful sexy women anyway. So be at ease. Your nose is not out of shape; your bum is not as big as you see it in the mirror.

, It takes just a quick glance, maybe three seconds, for someone to evaluate you when you meet for the first time. In this short time, the other person forms an opinion about you based on your appearance, your body language, your demeanour, your mannerisms, and how you are dressed. Dress like a tart, that’s the impression he will have.

"
"
Be on time.,
Be yourself and be at ease.,
Relax!",How to Prepare for a First Date and Find Great Things to Do3," The person you are meeting for the first time is not interested in your “good excuse” for running late. Plan to arrive a few minutes early. And allow flexibility for delays in traffic or taking a wrong turn.

",How to Prepare for a First Date and Find Great Things to Do4," Well, it couldn't be any truer in this situation. You might rant about how much you enjoy extreme sports and living life in the fast lane, but when the first date comes around, that will not wash. Instead, find ideas that will be enjoyed by both of you.

, This is the most popular and the safest, as you don't have to do much speaking. Remember it must be a girly movie, unless she mentions another. (This will show that you care for her comfort).

, This can be a bit tricky; you are going to have to hold down a conversation. Secret tip: Before you make your date find out a bit about the other person, like date of birth, hometown, pet animal etc. Then do some research on-line and get as much information as you can. This will give you an edge you will be thanking me for in the years to come. Remember it’s about the other person, not about you. If you do this the conversation will go back and forth between the two of you all night.

, A cheap and fairly easy ""sport,"" it allows for some physical contact when you have to give her a crash course on how to hold the putter, say no more.

, Yes, amusement parks are generally aimed at children, but who says that adults can't engage in some childish fun? Take her for a spin on the Ferris wheel or win her a big old teddy bear, and she won't have a chance to get bored.

, It can simply be a quiet get together that allows for stimulating conversation, which is also a good venue for you to show off your sandwich-making skills and your sangria expertise.(Remember point 2: conversation).

, You could just sit in the park. Before you go, make yourself a list of questions to ask - that's a great way to start a conversation. But watch out: don't ask questions that are too personal or else she/he will think your investigating her/him. You will see that the conversation will go great, you just need that kind of start.

, Why not test her driving skills? F1 carting is an exciting and fairly cheap way to test her road abilities and take her for a ride(Secret tip: Let her win the first or second race: you won’t regret it).

, There is nothing like looking at people from a bird's-eye view, floating above the city with her hanging on to you because she is afraid of heights.

Drink responsibly.",How to Make the Perfect Dinner for Date Night," While you wait for your meal to finish cooking, serve some simple appetizers. These should be light and not overly filling. The goal is to avoid getting full on appetizers while trying to not get hangry and kill the mood. A light tossed salad makes an excellent appetizer.
You might also try bruschetta or hummus and pita chips.
Remember to keep it simple. Your appetizers should not overshadow your main dish.
Be sure to plan ahead and avoid serving anything that your date might not like. Pay attention to things that they have ordered at restaurants. You can also ask them what they like. If you noticed that they like shellfish, try asking “what would think about having shrimp cocktail for dinner?”;
, Your main dish should be something that is not so heavy that it makes you lethargic yet so light that you are still hungry. You should ideally be full but not uncomfortably so. Consider a dish that shows off your cooking skills, yet requires little preparation. If you are hoping that the night takes a romantic turn, try including aphrodisiacs like oysters, almonds and basil.Avoid cooking difficult to eat or messy foods. Soups and pastas are a dangerous choice. You want to focus on the conversation and your date, not avoiding stains.
Try not to use too much garlic, onion or other foods with strong odors. If things get more romantic later, your smelly breath might be a turn off.
A sautéed meat and vegetable dish is an easy and safe dish to serve on a dinner date.
Be sure to plan ahead and cook something that you know your date will enjoy.

, Like the other parts of the meal, the dessert should be a light dish that is not overly filling. A light pastry or gelato with some fruit and berries are excellent after dinner treats. Try incorporating aphrodisiacs like strawberries and chocolate into the dessert. Avoid messy desserts. Syrups and sauces can make a huge sticky mess.
Be sure to prepare a dessert that you know your date enjoys.

, Before the meal, offer your date a drink. Depending on your and your date’s preferences, this can be an alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage. After the meal, you may want to offer your date some hot tea or coffee after dessert. This will help you stave off being drowsy after eating. However, if things are feeling more romantic, you may also offer another round of cocktails or wine. Play it by ear and see what the moment requires.Try to figure out ahead of time what your date enjoys drinking so that you can have it waiting for them. Pay attention to what they order at bars and restaurants, or you can just ask them what their favorite drink is.
Your meal choice will help determine what type of wine, if any, you will serve. Red wines go well with red meats, while white wines pair well with lighter meats and vegetarian meals.
Food and drink combinations vary, so you can also try pairing beer or liquor with your meal., Before your date arrives, be sure to thoroughly clean your home or apartment. A dingy and cluttered living space will kill the mood almost immediately. Vacuum your carpets, dust, and put away any clutter. This also applies if you are planning a date night with your partner who you live with. Having a clean space will help everyone feel less stressed and more romantic.

, Before your date arrives, or you and your partner begin cooking, try to look your best. This can include taking a shower, shaving, putting on makeup, wearing nice clothes, or whatever it is you need to do to feel good about yourself. Putting your best foot forward tells your date that you care about them.You might also want to get a haircut before the date. This might give you a little extra confidence.
Do not overdo it. Make sure that you look nice and are comfortable with your attire. Wearing things that make you uncomfortable will be distracting and kill the mood.

, Serve the meal on your nicest dinnerware and use your best cutlery. This will demonstrate that you value the meal and your date/partner’s presence. The goal is to make the person you are with, as well as yourself, feel special. Avoid using paper or plastic dinnerware. This will make the dinner seem thrown together at the last second.

, Clear off your dining table and set it with a table cloth and napkins. You will want to create a clean and intimate space for you and your date. It is important that you are able to look across at each other without any distractions. You may decide to set the table with some flowers to help the mood. However, do not place them so that it is difficult to see your date.

, Try dimming the lights in the space where you will be eating. You can also light a few candles to help set the mood. The dimmed lights and candle will help create an intimate setting for you and your date. Avoid using any scented candles. These might distract from the food you are serving.
Be sure to put out the candles when you are done with them. You want to kindle a fire in each other’s hearts, not the dining room.

, Turning on some light music in the background is a great way to set the mood. Play music that is romantic and that you both enjoy. If you are early in a relationship, this will kill any dead silence. It might also get the two of you dancing. Avoid playing the radio. Advertisements can be a loud and obnoxious distraction.
Try creating a Pandora station or a Spotify playlist of romantic music. Try Kenny G., Adele or Al Green.

, Before your dinner date, make sure that you have everything that you need for the meal. Figure out what foods your date does and does not like. Review your recipes and make sure that you have all of the necessary ingredients. Prepare some of the meal beforehand so that you are not rushed when your date arrives or your dinner begins. You want to make sure that you have enough attention for your date.Cooking a meal that your guest does not like is an easy way to kill the mood.
Make sure that you do not cook something that they are allergic to. Your date probably will not find a trip to the ER very endearing.

, Do not chew with your mouth open, talk with a mouth full of food, or pass gas at the table. Unless you, or your date, are from a culture where these practices are considered polite, be sure to avoid them. Proper table etiquette demonstrates to your date that you are considerate of other people. Put your napkin in your lap, not in your shirt.
Turn of the TV. Unless watching a movie is part of your dinner plan, the TV should be off.

, Talk with your date during the dinner and try to avoid any long silent pauses. Ask them about their work, family, school, or hobbies. If your dinner date is with your partner, you should have already developed a rapport but it is important to work on your communication. However, if you are new in a relationship, maintaining the steady flow of conversation will help you build a new connection.Ask your date things like “how long have you worked at Costco” or “Skydiving is quite the hobby. How did you get into that?”
If you are nervous about what to talk about, prepare a list of topics to discuss during the meal.
Find things to talk about that you and your date have in common. For example, if you both like a certain film genre, ask your date things like “what’s your favorite movie?” and “who is your favorite director?”

, Although getting a nice buzz will help set the mood, getting drunk might be a good way to derail the romance train. If you are going to serve alcohol, try to avoid getting drunk. It is unlikely that your date will be terrible amused by this. Show some self-control and do not overdo it. "

, You don't need this, but it works great with the ladies. If you decide you want it, you won't be sorry. The girl will be all over you, if it smells good. However if you put too much on, it might stink, and she won't want anything to do with you!

, Now that you have everything planned out, put it all together. Get into your clothes, put on your cologne, fix your hair. Don't do it sloppily-act like you really are going out on the date.

This is a very important step-don't be lazy and skip it, you will regret it.

, Rushing home from school/work and jumping into your outfit can leave you looking red and sweaty. Skip that and take a relaxing but refreshing shower.

Don’t put cologne on your clothes, walk through a cloud of it, or rub it in once applied.Prevent bad breath by brushing your teeth, flossing, using mouthwash, and gargling with a half-teaspoon of baking soda dissolved in a small glass of water., If you’re driving, you’ll need your driver’s license. Bring cash or a credit card that covers more than you think you’ll need for expenses on the date.


For instance, people spend an average of $80 on a date, and that number may increase for special occasions like Valentine’s Day or a first date.If you live in a city where the cost of living is higher, that number can even double.
Don’t plan to spend more than you can reasonably afford. Plan a budget-friendly date, if necessary, like sight-seeing.

, It’s normal to feel a little nervous on a date, but it’s important to be yourself, and your nervous self isn’t necessarily your genuine self. Calm yourself down when you’re nervous. Realize that you’ll have other dates and opportunities to impress a girl, maybe even the same girl.Avoid looking nervous by staying calm and not fidgeting, tapping your foot, or biting your nails. Relax your muscles and think calmly and positively.

, Don’t overload her with compliments the whole date, or you might come off as insincere. Instead, express your appreciation with genuine feeling when you first see her, and whenever else it feels natural and truthful.


Avoid comments about her body or what she’s wearing. When you greet her, try saying, “You look beautiful,” before or after a kiss on the cheek. Or, focus on something about her that’s more specific, like “You have gorgeous eyes.”Compliment good features of her personality as you notice them, such as her intellect or sense of humor.

, Consciously focus on having good manners. Open car doors and building doors for her. Offer her your hand if she’s getting out of the car. Pull out her seat in a restaurant. Offer her your jacket if it’s cold.


Be polite to others in front of your date as well, such as employees of locations you visit on your date., Smile at her and make frequent eye contact. Be an active listener by nodding and showing that you’re interested in what she says. Definitely avoid staring at or showing interest in other girls during your date.


For instance, don’t interrupt when she’s talking. Give her your full attention, as if you’re going to be quizzed on it later. Listening to your date is the best way you can find out what she wants and expects in a relationship.

, Be the one who asks the waiter for the bill if you’re at a restaurant. You want to impress her, so plan to pay for the date and don’t make a show about it – in fact, if you want to earn her respect, pay it discreetly without making any mention of it. Many girls expect their date to pay, and she may be insulted if you suggest that she pays half.Don’t say anything to her about the bill unless she comments on it or offers to contribute to it. If she does, try saying, “Please, allow me.”
Who pays the bill is a delicate situation. A girl may offer to pay towards the bill, but be annoyed if you take her up on it. However, if your date sincerely insists on paying, don’t refuse to allow her to contribute to the bill, either. Use your best judgment.

, Don’t hesitate, be fidgety, or otherwise make the parting awkward. Tell her that you’d like to see her again, if you would. Pay attention to her body language, eyes and facial expressions. If you believe she’ll be responsive to it, give her a hug and a kiss either on the cheek or the lips. Don’t break apart right away or linger too long.Try saying, “This was a great time! I’d love to see you again.”
For example, if she seems put off when you go in for a hug, don’t try to follow it up with a kiss.Don’t give her a sloppy kiss! You don’t want it to be aggressive or leave slobber all over her face. Give her a soft kiss with your lips closed for a few seconds. The more gentle and tender, the better."

It's easy to quickly find a girl to crush on, but before you make any moves, think a little more deeply.,
It's best to like a girl for her true self, not just for her looks.,
Avoid asking a girl out because of her appearance; not only might the girl feel hurt, but you may regret it in the future.

",How to Improve Chances of Dating a Special Girl1," What is it that you like about this girl? Do you like her for her true self or for her looks?

However, choose your topics wisely and avoid touchy subjects you know she'll be upset about. Ask questions about what she likes, but keep from asking too many or she may freak out. Add a little about yourself as well, but mostly keep the spotlight on her unless if she directs it to you!

, However, if she tends to sit with girls only, don't join them. Not only might she be embarrassed - and you as well - but it's an obvious sign that you are crushing on her. If you are unable to sit with her at lunch, try to get a seat near or next to her in class.

, If she drops her books or can't reach a certain item, offer your assistance. However, refrain from running around and helping her with every single thing - this will be exhausting for both you and her. Keep from labeling her as the helpless damsel; this will annoy her.

, Start a small conversation with her on the way, even if it's short! Every word matters in your sentences at this point, so be sure they have a purpose and will not offend her.

, Avoid inappropriate or corny jokes; these will not please her.

, One or two will do!

, This will help form a big group that has both you and her in it! If you notice that she has a friend or two that always hangs around with her, start hanging out with them and bring a close friend along as well. This will help form a small group that has both you and her in it! Not only that, but small groups are easier to maneuver. Plus, they may go to more places to have fun at, such as fast-food restaurants, the movies, malls, etc. while big groups normally stay in the cafeteria.

Does she appear comfortable with her? Is it positive energy that is flowing from her when you interact with her, or is it negative energy?

, There may be something going on between her and you, and you need to awaken that!

, Don't be disappointed, however. There is a reason for this, and you'll find the right match for you in the future. Keep looking towards the horizon! You'll find her!

, Don't bombard her with too many, or she may panic and your relationship will fall flat. Show her in subtle ways that you like her.

, This move is not recommended if you are not confident with her feelings for you.

, If she responds positively, blushes or brushes her hands against yours, you might want to try holding hands. If she draws away or appears uncomfortable, now might not be the time; wait a little.

, However, never have a friend ask her if she likes you, or tell her that you like her. Not only will this make you appear as a coward and possibly ruin her opinion of you, but it will also make her feel intimidated, and she may refuse to say anything.

, Also add a reason or two explaining why you like her. Make sure those reasons are pure and genuine; if you tell her you like her only for her appearance, she may feel hurt and that will ruin her relationship with her. Tell her it's fine if she has no feelings for you, and that you would be willing to stay friends if she preferred it that way.

, You must also have proof that she likes you; don't pretend that she likes you, for this will only hurt you and it will not benefit your relationship with her.

, Not only are you hurting yourself even more, but you are also hindering yourself from finding that right person for you. She is merely blinding your eyes from seeing the sun rise in the horizon; in other words, she is distracting you from the true future!

Don't give up - there's still hope!

"
"
The moment you've confirmed whether she likes you back or not is very important, as it will influence your next decision: asking her out.,
On your first date with her, it's best that you have a group date instead of a one-on-one date.",How to Improve Chances of Dating a Special Girl4," Fortunately, asking her out is simpler than pursuing the answer of whether she likes you or not. Once you've received her response (yes, she likes you), proceed to ask, ""Would you like to go out with me?""


If the answer is yes, plan out a time and date when both you and her will be available. Be sure it's a place where you both will be comfortable. Make sure you take her home before curfew!
If the answer is no, she still likes you, but she probably isn't ready for this step. It's fine - just tell her you can and will wait. She may accept another invitation from you in the future, but as for now, remain as her friend - the only difference is that you know you two like each other!

, Group dates are less intimidating and are free of stress. Not only will you be building a closer, more intimate relationship with your crush, but you will also be strengthening other important relationships as well! It's recommended that you go on a few group dates together before starting to go on one-on-one dates.


Group dates don't have to be special people. They can just be your original small group or a few friends of hers and yours. However, be sure there is no rivalry between one of your friends and hers, or there may be problems! Be sure everyone is comfortable with everyone.

Identify where you are eating.,
Consider the spice factor.,
Avoid messy foods.,
Order like an adult.",How to Know What Not to Eat on a Date," Before you can even decide if the menu is “dateworthy,” you’ll need to determine what kind of food you are going to be eating. If you get to choose the restaurant you’ll have more of an advantage because then you can make sure the menu is date-friendly. However, if your date is the one making the selection, find out what the restaurant serves so you’ll know what your choices are ahead of time.


Check out the menu. Many restaurants post a menu online, however if the spot your date has chosen does not provide this option, drop by the restaurant and either grab a “to-go” version of the menu or ask to see the menu.
Identify an appetizer, main course and dessert you would feel comfortable eating. Look for foods you are familiar with and generally don’t leave you covered in sauces or drippy dips.
Inquire about special orders. If you can’t identify something that you will feel comfortable ordering (for example, your date chooses a rib joint and you are vegan) ask the host if they would consider a special order. In some cases restaurants would entertain an off the menu order.;
, If you have a delicate pallet or sensitive stomach, steer clear of any food that may be spicy or gassy. One good bout of gas or diarrhea will definitely put you in the friend zone immediately following your first trip to the toilet.


Thai food. This seemingly harmless fare can pack quite a punch if you don’t order correctly. Many Thai restaurants help out the dinner by denoting especially spicy dishes by placing a certain number of chilli peppers next to the entrée.
Indian food. If you have a sensitive stomach it would be a good idea to order daal (a soothing lentil based-soup) or mutter paneer (stewed peas and cubes of special cheese). Nearly every dish at an Indian restaurant has a certain amount of heat—some much more than others.
Wings and ribs. When it comes to avoiding too much spice at a wing or rib restaurant, always order mild. Some people are concerned about coming off looking like a wimp by ordering mild sauce, however sweating profusely and downing glass after glass or milk will most likely make you look worse.

, Long strands of red sauce laden pasta or giant crab legs you have to crack open yourself may be considered to be too messy for a first or early date.


If you have to slurp it, avoid it. While oysters have been thought to have an aphrodisiac quality, seeing you or your date slurping those babies down will most likely remove any sex appeal you were trying to build.
Sloppy Joes or messy burgers will end up in your lap and all over your face. Even if you are craving a loose meat sandwich, resist the urge and go for something neater like a chicken sandwich.
If you need a bib, avoid the food. Lobster may be delicious, but seeing you wildly digging into the red shell, wearing a bib may not be the biggest turn on for your date.
Extremely cheesy food can be difficult to wrangle. A cheese-laden piece of pizza may be tough when you are trying to get that long string of cheese to finally break off.

, Even if you have a McDonald’s Happy Meal addiction don’t reveal this to your date until later down the road (perhaps after you’ve been married for a few years).


Ordering from the kid’s menu is off limits. Some restaurants will allow adults to order off the kid’s menu, however stop short from ordering that grilled cheese or hot dog. You want your date to feel as if he/she is on a date with a real grown up.
Have a refined beverage. You don’t need to sip fine wine, however ordering a milkshake or a big glass of milk with your meal in an early dating situations creams “juvenile” —unless that's the sort of thing you first bonded over.
Go for the real thing. Order a nice piece of fish or chicken instead of fish sticks or chicken fingers.

Make the necessary reservations.,
Be prepared to improvise.",How to Have the Best Date Ever1," If you are in charge of the planning, you should have some suggestions in mind before giving them a call. Whether it’s a first date or your fifth date, talk to the other person about the things they would like to do (and eat!).


Remember that you are going out together. Think of activities that you not only enjoy, but that you would like to do with your date.
If you are still getting to know each other, be sure to plan something that allows you to talk. Have dinner at a quiet restaurant or go to an outdoor exhibit.
Once the date is planned, ensure that you both know what you’ll be doing so that you can plan your outfit accordingly.;
, If you are planning an epic date, you’ll need to have good timing. Don’t plan at the last minute and offer some scheduling options.


Don’t assume that your date is free on Friday evening. Offer a few days and times that work for you. If it’s a first date, have a clear start and end time. That way you won’t get stuck in an uncomfortable situation for too long if things don’t go well., Once you know your date’s interests, you can plan something unconventional that will set you apart in a nice way. Remember that you may need some extra time to plan if you’re doing something special.


Go for a hike or go to the beach if you like outdoor activities.
See an art show or a explore a new coffee shop if you are more low-key., Going out to brunch may be enough for a great date. If you are having a good time, however, you may not want to part ways too soon. Plan a secondary activity near by in case the fun hasn’t ended. Look up bars or coffee shops in the area. Suggest going for a drink to keep the conversation going. , You don’t want to find a great restaurant, only to learn that there are no tables when you arrive. If you plan an activity like rock climbing, call in advance and let them know when you are coming. Find out if you’ll need to bring anything extra. If you do get to your spot and find that you can’t get in, it’s good to have a plan B. Do your research beforehand, and have something else in mind.

, Despite your planning, things don’t always work out as you’d imagined. Hopefully you and your date will read each other well and things will flow nicely. If things are going well, something unplanned may arise spontaneously. Don’t be afraid to step out of the box if you both agree that a change of plans would be fun.

Be considerate.,
Read social cues.,
Dress appropriately.",How to Have the Best Date Ever2," Be polite to your date and the people around you. This means using respectful language, giving them your undivided attention, and arriving on time.


Pay attention to your date. Don’t use your cell phone unless you absolutely have to. Be punctual. Being late shows that you don’t respect your date’s time. If you are running late, give him or her a call to say when you will arrive., Pay close attention to your date as you interact. Notice his or her tone of voice and body language. These cues can let you know if they are having a good time.If your date looks uncomfortable for any reason, try changing the subject or suggesting a change of activity.

, The activity you choose to do will dictate what is appropriate. Try to dress on the nicer side no matter what you do. There is no need to go overboard, but looking nice shows that you care.For men, wear a button down instead of a T-shirt.
For women, spend a little time on your hair or wear a cute blouse.
No matter what, it is important to feel comfortable. Don’t wear something that doesn’t fit your personal style or makes it hard for you to move around."

Be yourself.,
Relax and be present.,
Have good conversations.,
Listen actively.,
Be romantic.",How to Have the Best Date Ever3," A good date means that both of you are having a nice time. Be true to who you are and your needs along the way.Remember that you want to put your best foot forward, but that doesn’t mean changing your personality. If you want to start a meaningful relationship, you’ll have to show your true colors eventually!

, Dating can cause anxiety, but you have to relax to have a good time. Smile and enjoy the moment. Be fully present and aware of how you are both feeling. Let the chemistry arise organically. If it doesn’t happen, it’s okay to part ways.


Ending a date early can be awkward. Some people are comfortable making up excuses about meeting friends or running an errand. If you really aren’t having a good time, you can also try saying something like, “I’m not feeling so great, I think I’m going to head out soon.”

, To have a good flow of conversation, ensure that you both have equal talking time. Don’t ask too many questions back to back, and don’t only talk about yourself! Think of things you would like to know about your date. Ask questions about his or her hobbies, goals, or experiences. Strike a balance and share your stories as well. For example, you might ask an open ended question like, “What are your favorite things about playing soccer?” This may lead you to more questions or things you would like to share about yourself. For example, “I also love running. I hope to join the track team later this year.”

, Actively listening is a great life skill. Show that you are listening to your date by facing him or her and looking him or her in the eye. Do not check your phone while the other person is speaking. Verbally confirm that you are listening by repeating what was said or pausing before you respond. For example, your date might say, “My cousin went to the World Cup a few years ago.” If this is impressive to you, turn your body toward them and say, “Wow! The World Cup!” Then let them continue with the story.

, Do something flirty like touching the person’s arm or shoulder. Share a dessert or snack as a way to show intimacy and interest.


Use body language to let them know if you want a kiss. Step closer to them, or linger when you say goodbye. Note that the other person will reciprocate if they also want to kiss.Don’t get between the sheets too soon. Sleeping together before you get to know each other can cloud your judgement and cause you to miss any red flags."

Remember that flirting is about showing him you are interested in a sexy and compelling way, so don't be afraid to put yourself out there a little bit. Here are some basics you should know:


Smile. Your smile is your best weapon, so use it! Whenever you see the object of your future lip-lockery, communicate that you're happy to see him with a little grin. Step it up a level by smiling at him across a room like this: lock eyes, let the smile spread slowly across your face, then look away. He'll be hooked.
Do light touches. Find excuses to touch him in small, fleeting ways, such as lightly laying a hand on his arm while he's talking or ""accidentally"" bumping into him gently when you're walking together.
Pay him a compliment. Boys love to be complimented just as much as girls do! Focus on a quality you genuinely like about him — whether it's his eyes, his sense of humor, his hair, and so on — and tell him why you appreciate it. Because compliments traditionally run one way, from guy to girl, it'll make you stand out to him.

A nice compliment doesn't have to be complicated. If you're really struggling with how to pull it off, just do this: look him in the eyes, spit out what you have to say (""Has anyone told you yet that your hair looks amazing that way?""), smile, and carry on as usual. Done!

;
, Don't go overboard and message him constantly, but do send a few texts every so often. If you do it right, he won't be able to stop thinking about you; if you do it too much, though, he'll get annoyed. Here are a few guidelines:


End the conversation early. Don't let the exchange drag on so long that it becomes boring and labored. Instead, bow out while it's still interesting so that he'll already be looking forward to the next time he talks with you.
Spark up a conversation with something other than ""hi."" Having a more specific opening gives you something to talk about, instead of just awkwardly asking how it's going. Tell him what you're doing, ask about his plans for an upcoming event (like a dance, homework assignment or holiday), or bring up an inside joke. Whatever it is, it should be something that invites him to text you back.
Set up the next interaction before you leave the conversation (optional). If you want to get him hooked for next time, try to set up something for the future before you leave. For instance, it could be something like ""I'll have to get more music recommendations from you tomorrow"" or ""We should check out sometime!""

, If you want to kiss a boy (or have him kiss you!), step up your looks a little bit. There's no need to go into full makeover mode, but there are a few small things you can do to make yourself more appealing. Try focusing on these areas:


Smell amazing. Boys (and people in general) are subconsciously more attracted to people who smell appealing. Shower at least once a day (and twice if you tend to get sweaty or dirty), wear deodorant, and find a perfume or body spray that smells nice with your individual body chemistry. Apply scent to your wrists, your throat and the back of your knees. If you really want to cover your bases, use a scented body wash and lotion as well.
Rock luscious lips. Get rid of chapped skin by gently brushing over your lips with a toothbrush, then apply lip balm to keep them soft. For a pop of color, try a lip stain or lipstick.

Avoid using sticky lip glosses. They look nice, but they're terrible for kissing.


Pay attention to your hair. Most guys won't notice what you're actually doing with your hair, they'll just note whether or not it looks awesome. Make the extra effort by adding 5 or 10 minutes to your routine in the morning, or try some of the looks in How to Do Simple and Cute Hairstyles.

, Even if you've tried some light, flirty touches, breaking the touch barrier in a really noticeable way can help make your intentions clear. If he responds well to the smaller touches, go bigger! Here are a few classics:


Sit closer to him. If you're sitting together on a couch or in a car, move in closer than you need to. If he seems to like it, you're on the right track.
Try holding his hand. If you see a good opening for slipping your hand into his, take it! Or, make your hand look available for holding by avoiding folding your arms or twiddling your thumbs.
Go in for a hug. This works best when you're leaving or parting. Lean in for a hug, putting your arms around his neck or shoulders, and hold it for two or three seconds before pulling away. That should seem long enough to feel intimate, but not so long that the hug gets awkward.

, Boys often complain that girls move in packs so much that it's difficult to get one-on-one time, so make it easy for him! Hang back from the crowd, or go outside to grab some fresh air. If you really want to make sure you're alone, you could always ask him out on a solo date.


If you're trying to get him alone, find opportunities to pull away from the crowd. Ask if he'd like to step outside for a bit, offer to walk home with him or help run tedious errands, or drop by his house and ask if he'd like to go out for a bit.

, If you time it right, an intimate atmosphere can do half the work and help him see you in a sexy light. Consider these aspects:


Try to be alone with him, and if there are any lulls in the conversation, let them happen. Remember, he can't kiss you if you don't stop talking.
Hang out in forgiving lighting. There's a reason why most kisses don't happen in broad daylight: because softer light glosses over flaws and seems more romantic. Sunsets, campfires, candlelight, rainy days and soft porch lights at night can all make you look more appealing.

, If you're feeling brave, test the waters by planting a kiss on his cheek next time you're saying goodbye. You're probably clear to kiss him on the lips later if he seems to like it.


Don't just give him a quick peck. Keep your lips soft, and angle slightly up toward his ear or down toward the corner of his mouth. He'll get the message.

, Be bold about making eye contact and do it often, especially right before you're about to go in for the liplock. Make sure that your eyes are settled on him and aren't distracted . Not only does looking deep into his eyes seem romantic, it also communicates that you're honest and sincere.

, How you carry yourself can tell him a lot about how you feel. Making your posture open makes it a lot easier to move in for a kiss and, when you do, he won't be as surprised. Try these:


Don't fold your arms, twiddle your thumbs, or clasp your hands together. If you can't help fidgeting, put your hands behind your back so that you look open from the front.
Orient your body toward him. If you're standing, keep your toes pointed at him. If you're sitting, point your knees.
Cross your ankles instead of your legs. Instead of tightly crossing your legs when you sit down, cross at your ankles instead. It looks open, but still demure.
Don't try to hide your nervousness. If you're blushing, fidgeting or twirling your hair too much, let it happen! Obvious signs that you're anxious mean you like him a lot, and he'll probably know to take it as a compliment.

, Find an excuse to sit or stand close to him, and lean in so that your face is inches away from his. As you do this, maintain eye contact.


Gauge his reaction. It should be pretty obvious that you're leaning in to kiss him, so watch how he responds. If he doesn't pull away, you're probably clear to go ahead.
Make it extra obvious. If you're not sure that he's getting the point, smile slowly and close your eyes — that should be a huge signal that you're going to kiss him.

, When you first make contact, lightly graze your lips over his. Try to keep your pressure light and your movements slow and gentle. If it seems like he's enjoying it, you can ramp it up in a little bit.


Avoid putting your lips into a tight pucker — that's a position reserved for non-romantic kissing, and might communicate the wrong idea.

, Don't just let your hands sit there — use them to make the kiss better! Try these moves:


Rest them on his shoulders, hips or chest, or on the sides of his face.
Tangle your fingers up in his hair.
Use your hands to pull him closer.

, As you get more comfortable, you can make the pressure more insistent or the kisses faster. Keep the kiss interesting by changing up the intensity and speed, and try to avoid settling into one technique for too long.

, You don't have to French kiss to have a great smooch, but it can kick the romance up a notch. Here's how to get it started:


Open your mouth slightly. Part your lips enough that you could comfortably get your tongue through them.
Lightly run your tongue over his lower lip. Keep the contact brief, no more than a second or two, then pull your tongue back. If he's interested, he might do it back to you.
Tilt your head to the side a bit. French kissing is easier if one person's mouth is tilted significantly sideways. This prevents your noses and teeth from bumping.
Move your tongue into his mouth in light, darting movements. The most important trick to French kissing is to keep your tongue in motion — don't let it just rest limply inside his mouth. As with when you started kissing, try to keep the pressure light and the movement gentle. Remember, you can always go harder and faster later.

, Ending the kiss before it gets boring is the best way to leave off. If you stop while it's still fun, he'll instantly be looking forward to next time. Pull back, look into his eyes, and smile.

Take the slow approach.,
Leave the slobbering to your dog.,
Keep your lips gently pursed.,
Tilt your head slightly to one side or the other.,
Use your tongue to French kiss.,
Break up the kissing with romantic stares.,
Be creative.",How to Improve Your Kissing1," Lean in slowly for the kiss to build dramatic anticipation. The more excited you and your partner are for a kiss to commence, the more intense it will be when you finally connect your lips.


Start off with small pecks and build up to bigger and more intense kissing. By starting small you can slowly ease into an intimate act with your partner.
Take breaks between kissing your partner to look at one another without touching lips. You can leave your hands on your partner's hips, shoulders, or run your hands across your partner's face in smooth caresses. By staring into your partner's eyes, you can show him/her that you are truly absorbed in them as a unique person.;
, There's nothing worse than a slobbery kiss. Just nothing. Other than making you appear to have no idea what you're doing, nobody wants to have your spit all over their face. Well, maybe just a little bit of spit.


Avoid opening your mouth too wide. A wide-mouthed approach can cause you to lose a ridiculous amount of saliva to your partner's precious face.
Swallow often. Don't forget to swallow your excess saliva while kissing. Your spit has to go somewhere, just don't make it your partner's face.

, You want your lips to be in a nice plump purse, but avoid pursing your lips too tightly. If you tighten your lips together too strongly in a protruding kissy face, your lips will lose their plumpness and will not be as luscious for kissing.(Ladies: this is the same kissy face you make when putting on your lipstick!)

, Most right-handed people will feel more natural tilting their head to the right, and left-handed people will prefer to tilt left. The important thing is that you and your partner are tilting the same direction (i.e. both to the right or both to the left), which will create a mirror-effect and allow you to lock lips.


Transition smoothly between tilting your head to the right and the left. You can make your kissing game more interesting by changing up movements from side to side every few kisses. The transition should come at the end of a kiss and the beginning of another.
Don't move your head from side to side too frequently. Doing so can create sloppy rhythm and can become uncomfortable for both people involved.

, Slowly and lightly sweep your tongue along your partner's lower lip, tongue, and gums. Start off very gently and slowly increase in pressure and pace as your partner starts to return the tongue action.


Don't stick your entire tongue in your partner's mouth, you really only need to use about the front third of your tongue. Use quick, sweeping motions and make sure that your tongue is constantly moving. Letting your tongue fall limp in your partner's mouth is not sexy.
This is where it can really get slobbery. Make sure to swallow often to avoid allowing too much saliva to build up in your mouth and spill over into your partner's mouth. There is a fine line between sexy and slobbery. Try not to cross it.

, Pull your lips apart every once in a while to put some space between you and your partner and gaze into each other's eyes. Taking a break can make your kissing all the more intense once you reconnect. Plus, there's no better way to show someone you are truly paying attention to them than by staring sweetly into their eyes.

, Try different gentle nibbling/sucking/kissing/tongue combinations to keep it fresh and exciting.


Give the ""lip-o-suction"" move a try. Kiss your partner's upper lip while your partner nibbles and sucks on your lower lip, then switch.Interrupt your kissing with small bites and nibbles. A sensual nibble on your partner's bottom lip can break up with rhythm of lip kissing in a good way. Be careful not to bite your partner's lip too hard, you're not trying to eat your partner's face.
Mix in small pecks with larger, more passionate kisses. Doing so adds variety and allows you to take breaks in between intense make-out sessions.

Pay attention to your partner's body language.,
Caress your partner's neck, ears, and face.,
Grab your partner's arms, shoulders and back.,
Place your hands on your partner's shoulders or around his/her waist.,

Gently pull on your partner's hair by running your fingers through the hair on the back of his/her head just above the neck.",How to Improve Your Kissing2," Kissing isn't just about paying attention to what you and your partner's lips are doing. Your whole body should be involved in the act of making out to achieve the most sensual and pleasurable experience possible. The way your partner moves the rest of his/her body while you are kissing can tell you a lot about how they are feeling and what they think about your performance.



Positive signs to look for: Your partner pulling you closer, squeezing you with his/her hands, kissing and caressing with a sense of intense urgency, breaking into random smiles or giggles, or frequent sighing. If you notice that your partner reacts in a particularly positive way to certain actions, be sure to take note. Your partner will appreciate your attentiveness and definitely recognize that you are making an impressive effort to understand what makes them feel the best.

Negative signs to look for: Your partner pulling away, pushing your shoulder away, not touching you at all with his/her hands, barely moving his/her lips, or trying to close his/her lips as much as possible to force you to stop.

, A mini massage of these sensitive areas can be extremely arousing. Lightly run your fingers and gently run your thumb in a sweeping motion over these areas.

, You can be a little more rough with these areas. A tight squeeze of your partner can send chills throughout their body. If you're feeling particularly sassy, give your partner a little butt squeeze. You'll be able to tell where they like to be touched by their body language.

, Move your fingers and/or thumb gently back and forth in a swaying motion to sweetly show your partner that you're there.


While women generally put their hands on a man's shoulders and men generally wrap their arms around a woman's waist, your position will more practically depend on the height difference between you and your partner.
That being said, the placement isn't really important, the recognition of each other is what counts.

, Then go in for the kiss. This slight moment of visual recognition coupled with a light touch can be subtly pleasant.

, These gentle pulls really say ""I want you.""

Work to sustain trust on both ends.,
Be consistent.,
Communicate effectively and regularly.Maintaining satisfaction on both accounts relies on frequent communication.,
Be on the same page.",How to Satisfy a Long Distance Lover3," Trust is an integral part of making any sort of relationship work. Yet, in other types of relationships, the ability to see each other physically can keep insecurities at bay. In long-distance relationships when you’re only seeing your partner every couple of weeks or months, it’s easy to become envious of the time they are spending with others.

This creates an environment that is susceptible to distrust, jealousy, and even infidelity.Have a talk with your partner to discuss what both of you want from the relationship. Are you in it for the long haul or just casually seeing how things go? Clearly communicate your expectations to your partner and be willing to listen as he or she does the same.
You should also discuss romantic boundaries.

Recognize if the person isn't interested.,
Experiment with your tongue a little.,
Try a few gentle nibbles.,
Incorporate your hands.",How to Initiate a First French Kiss," A French kiss shouldn’t just come out of nowhere. It should happen naturally at a time when two people are sharing an intimate and private moment together, and that means being physically close.To help set the mood, start by finding a way to be alone with the person so you can get close without other people hanging around and interrupting.


If you two are at a party, go for a walk or find somewhere quiet that you can talk.
If you're hanging out together, sit down beside the person on a couch, chair, or bench.;
, You can tell your partner that you're interested without saying anything at all. Your partner will subconsciously pick up on your subtle cues, and this will indicate your attraction and desire. You can drop these hints by:Parting your lips slightly and licking them
Smoothing down your hair or clothing
Raising your eyebrows slightly as your partner talks
Touching your face frequently
Orienting your entire body toward your partner
Smile a lot

, Eye contact is another powerful element of body language, and when two people are physically close to each other and make frequent eye contact, this will raise the level of intimacy between them.Frequent eye contact will indicate your attraction, and help you assess whether the chemistry you feel is reciprocated.


For instance, if your partner keeps looking away instead of making eye contact, it’s possible that person is just nervous, but it might also be a sign of lack of interest.
On the other hand, if your partner keeps locking eyes with you, this is a good sign that whatever you're feeling is definitely mutual!

, This gentle and sensual touch will establish a physical connection between the two of you, and make the kiss much easier.Make sure you gage how the person reacts:


Leaning in or pressing into your hand is a sign of interest that says your gesture is welcome.

Look your partner in the eyes, tilt your head slightly to one side and lean in toward the other person’s face.Don’t lean in too quickly, as this could make you seem nervous and over-eager, but it could also lead to bumped heads.
However, don’t go in too slowly either, as this could make you seem uncertain.

, If your partner also tilts their head and leans in toward you as well, this is a sign that you should have the confidence to go for the kiss! Just before your lips meet, close your eyes, as this gives the impression that you're honest and sincere.Keep your mouth closed at this point. Slightly pucker your lips and use firm but delicate pressure to press your lips against your partner’s., Once you’ve gotten comfortable brushing each other’s lips, you can introduce a bit of tongue to the kiss. Open your mouth a little wider and give your partner a moment to adjust and reciprocate.


With your tongue, gently graze your partner’s lips. If your partner’s mouth is now open as well, delicately use your tongue to explore the inside of their lips and tip of their tongue.
Use gentle pressure when you do this, and try to keep your tongue moving.Don’t open your mouth too wide, and don’t stick your tongue too far into your partner’s mouth., French kissing can get pretty hot and heavy, and it’s ok to take things slowly. Don’t be angry if you feel like your partner is uncomfortable or wants to slow down. Signs that your partner might want to slow down or stop include:Not opening their mouth or not using their tongue
Not reciprocating your actions
Pulling away or avoiding contact
Showing signs of discomfort or stress

, Once you and your partner get used to the basics, you can try out some more advanced French kissing techniques when you're both ready. You don’t have to do this all in the same makeout session though, so feel free to take your time!With your tongue, make slow and deliberate circular motions around your partner’s tongue.
Use the tip of your tongue to gently flick the tip of your partner’s tongue, and then pull your tongue back to give your partner a chance to do the same to you.

, While you have to be careful not to actually bite your partner, you can try a few seductive moves by gently nibbling or sucking your partner’s tongue and lips.Always use very gentle pressure when nibbling, and try to remain calm so you don’t get excited and bite too hard.
When you're French kissing, incorporate all these techniques at different times so that your tongues and lips are always moving, touching, and intertwining.

, When you and your partner are ready, you can also include gentle caressing into your kissing, such as putting your hands on their hips or back.Start slowly: try putting your hand on your partner’s face or neck and holding it there for a moment.
If your partner seems ok with the extra physical contact, move your hand slowly down their back and to the hips.
Don’t move quickly, but keep your hands moving and exploring, as long as your partner doesn’t become uncomfortable.

Studies have shown that above all other physical characteristics, women ranked a man's scent as the most important feature for sexual interest in him.Of course, the key word is ""a little"", as a big turn off can be a partner who reeks of an overpowering cologne or perfume. So apply just a little bit of scent to your body and don't overdo it.;
, Don't be shy about telling your partner what you like or asking what your partner prefers in terms of a good kiss. Rather than feel embarrassed about talking about your kissing dos and don'ts, communicating with each other will ensure you both have an enjoyable time. Be sure to discuss your preferences before you go in for a kiss, not during the kiss, so your partner doesn't take your comments as a rebuke., Create a private and romantic setting for you and your partner, like an intimate dinner at home or a beautiful view in a park. Consider if your partner has mentioned a special spot or location they enjoy spending time in and if it's an appropriate place for an intimate moment, suggest going there or bring them there. A comfortable, romantic mood will set the stage for a great, sensual kiss., Physical interaction like hand-holding or cuddling before you kiss can work as ice breakers and will indicate to your partner that you are interested in some lip action., As you lean in for a kiss, make sure your partner is also leaning in. Engage in eye contact to ensure you are both consenting to a kiss.


A good rule is to always close your eyes when you kiss, as your pupils will be dilated and it may appear a bit creepy or weird to your partner if you keep your eyes open., About 95% of the time, your partner will tilt their head to the right. If you can't tell which way your partner's head is going to tilt, go right to be safe.Regardless, if your partner is starting to tilt in one direction, go the opposite way so your noses don't collide before your lips do.


If you make a miscalculation and tilt the same way as your partner, or miss their mouth completely as your eyes are closed as you lean in, laugh it off and keep going. A certain level of awkwardness can lead to a great, memorable kiss., Studies have shown that women think the biggest mistake men make when they kiss is being too aggressive with their tongues. Men claim that women don't open their mouths wide enough as they kiss.So try to find the sweet spot between an open mouth (not too wide, like you're about to eat a plate of pasta) and a gentle kiss (not a big smack or with too much tongue)., Now that your lips are connecting, apply a little pressure to your partner's lips. You can kiss them a bit faster and a bit deeper.


If by this point your partner is very responsive to the kiss, you can begin to French kiss, which is just a fancy way of using your tongue as you kiss. Relax your tongue and move it against your partner's tongue in a calm, languid way, like licking an ice cream tongue. Avoid a totally limp or totally stiff tongue, and do not jam or aggressively stick your tongue in your partner's mouth., One of the most important aspects to creating a sensual kiss is varying where you kiss your partner.Try kissing different parts of your partner's face, paying special attention to the ears and neck. You can bite softly on their lower lip and nibble gently on their earlobe.And if you are sensually kissing a consistent partner, change up where you kiss them so your intimate moments don't feel mechanical or repetitive., Kissing isn't just limited to your lips, so consider your posture and body position as you kiss. Press your body against your partner's, and use your hands to gently stroke or touch your partner's neck, back, waist, and butt.Once you have engaged in relaxed, gentle physical moves, you could escalate to straddling your partner, or laying down to face each other as you kiss.


As the kiss becomes more sensual, it is important to always listen and tune into your partner.By paying attention to your partner's breathing, body language, and lip movements, you can gauge if they are enjoying the kiss and are ready to escalate further., Don't fall off the kissing train, especially once the early stages of your relationship have passed or the honeymoon period fades. Often, people in a long-term relationship stop kissing and lose that intimate, sensual connection.The intensity and emotion of your early kissing can actually become even more passionate as you get to know your partner better, and the communication between you two becomes stronger and more upfront. That old adage can certainly apply to kissing: practice makes perfect.

A good time to kiss someone is near the end of the first or the second date, but it will have to depend on the connection between you and the person you're wanting to kiss (after all, the first kiss doesn't have to only happen on a date).
There are good socially-considered romantic occasions, like prom, a movie, the beach that you can use to make a memorable first kiss. As long as you make sure that it's something both you and your date (or potential kissing partner) want to do.;
, This means dressing for the occasion, but also dress for your own comfort. Having a truly amazing and memorable first kiss is as much about your comfort as it is about the right place and time and being a good kisser.Try to avoid wearing super sticky lip gloss. It's hard to enjoy kissing someone if you're afraid your lips are going to be glued to theirs.
If you're worried about sweating too much, or smelling bad at the right moment, wear some deodorant and pop on a little perfume/cologne. Remember the scents, a little goes a long way. You don't want to over power your potential kissing partner with smells.

, Avoiding bad breath is important for having a first, and memorable kiss (unless you want it to be memorable in the wrong way). Pop in a mint or chew some gum after you eat or drink or brush your teeth before meeting up with your potential first kiss.Women, especially, tend to have a stronger sense of smell than men, so this step is especially important if you're a guy wanting to kiss a woman.
You don't have to make it super obvious that you're gearing up for a bit of lip-locking by popping a mint into your mouth. Keep it a light moment by offering some to your potential kissing partner.
Try to avoid really spicy foods, fish, garlic and onions, anything that has a really strong flavor and smell that lingers and lingers.

, Part of making a first kiss memorable and enjoyable is to build anticipation for the event itself in both parties. It also builds up a comfort level between you and the person you want to be kissing.


Touch is a good way to indicate interest in the other person: touching fingers or arm when you're talking with them. Brushing your hand or arm against theirs if you're taking a walk.
Lean in closer to talk to them so that you both get comfortable in one another's space. Obviously, if they lean back or cross their arms defensively, back off.
Anticipation means that fantasizing about the moment beforehand can make it more romantic when it actually happens, due to the neurotransmitter dopamine., Don't wait to decide when you're going to kiss someone until you're standing in the doorway at the end of the date. You'll want to be comfortable and having built up trust between the two of you.Try initiating the kiss in the car on the way home after the date, or while you're hanging out playing video games, or while you're out for a walk after dinner or coffee.
Be sober: kissing can trigger the chemical release of dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin (all fun, enjoyable, and healthy chemicals!). Alcohol can prohibit you from getting the full experience of those chemical releases.
Avoid distractions like having to pee, or your cell phone going off (if you're on a date, your cell phone should already be off).

, After the both of you have been building tension and enjoying yourself and getting comfortable, lean in close and let your potential partner close the remaining distance. If they don't lean in as well, it's best to back off.


You can also ask ""Can I kiss you?"" since a lot of people like to give their consent before someone just invades their personal space.
Make eye contact as you're doing this. Eye contact elevates the intimacy level of kissing.

, This makes it so that you're less likely to clash teeth or bump noses. So if your partner is tilting their head to the right, tilt yours to the left.

, If everything is going well and your potential partner has given their consent to kissing, touch lips gently. It can take a little bit to get in your kissing stride, so make sure you're paying attention to what the other person's lips are doing.Going in for a hard kiss is generally not the way to go. It usually feels too sudden and aggressive for your partner. Let the aggressiveness wait until you've gotten to know each others kissing styles and preferences.
Aggressiveness can also come across as desperation, which most people don't find particularly attractive.

, Seriously, it can be hard to do, since you're hoping to kiss right and you want everything to do well, but being relaxed and comfortable will make the kiss better for you and for your partner.


The best thing to do is to being yourself fully into the moment. Really feel the touch of the other person's lips, the way they smell (smell is incredibly important in kissing), how they are responding to you.

, If you're feeling relaxed and comfortable, try varying the kiss up. Memorable kisses are ones that are unusual (in a good way), so try out some different romantic techniques.Trying kissing other places than lips. You could start with your partner's neck and move up to their lips from there.
Or you could use your index finger on their chin to guide their mouth forward for kissing purposes.
Just remember: don't do things like lick someone's face unless they've expressly consented to that. A good rule of thumb is that a first kiss shouldn't get someone's face wet.

, It's best not to just let your hands lie at your side. Why shouldn't they get in on the fun? Of course, you want to make sure you aren't moving too fast, or putting your hands in too many places on the first kiss.


Good places for hands are: in your partner's hair, on their cheek, holding their sides or around their back.
Getting too frisky with your hands can actually detract from the kiss, so don't be putting them all over on the first kiss.

, The first kiss is usually considered to be a gentle, touch of the lips, a signal that you both like one another a lot. French kissing, if the first kiss goes well, can come later by mutual interest.Most people don't enjoy having someone's tongue stuck down their throat on the first kiss.

, It's a good idea to stop the kiss after a few moments. It will build the tension and it will give you a chance to check in with your partner to make sure all this is okay by them.


Slowly move your face back, even just a few inches so as to keep the intimacy of the moment. Check how they look. Are they excited? Are they trying to break away? Are they uncomfortable.
Check in verbally: ""Is this okay? Do you like this?""

, Now that you've cleared that first hurdle of making a really memorable kiss, don't push right in there demanding lots more. Now having a few more kisses, as long as your partner is okay with that, is lots of fun.


Now if you both want to go further, have at it. You're good to go.

, Making eye contact before and after the kiss increases your intimacy level, exponentially and allows to your check in with your partner and make sure that they are doing okay with everything.

, Even if you're too blown away by that first kiss to say anything, smiling can have the same effect. It shows that you're on board with the situation, that you enjoyed it, and that you're happy.


Make sure that your partner is smiling too and not looking uncomfortable, or upset.

, You don't have to say something, because it can be hard to think of something to say after a first kiss that isn't totally corny or cliché. Sometimes nonverbal communication can be just as important and not break the moment.


The key is to not stress about what you're going to say. Just allow whatever comes out naturally to come out (except something like ""I really have to pee;"" that definitely breaks the mood).
You could indulge in some nice physical contact like a hug.
However, you could also say something like ""I've been wanting to do that all night,"" or ""I never want to stop kissing you"" or even something as simply as ""You're amazing."" You want to make your partner feel good.

, Now this can mean anything from going to have sex or making plans for another date. You don't have to have sex just because you kissed something and having a wonderful night and kiss doesn't lessen anything because you didn't have sex.


Check in with your partner. See how they're doing and what they would like to do. The key is communication.
You can always, if you're both up for it, keep on kissing.

You don't need to go to great lengths to make yourself desirable, though. More often than not, a little basic grooming will do the trick.


For guys, give yourself a good, close shave beforehand. Stubble often feels rough and uncomfortable to women and could take away from the pleasure of the kiss.A dab of cologne can also be a good idea, but don't bathe yourself in it.
For women, applying an appealing scent can also be a powerful tool. Focus mostly on lotions since these make your skin look smoother while providing a more subtle hint of fragrance. Add a hint of body spray or perfume on top of that.;
, Moist, soft lips are far more kissable than dry, cracked lips. A little basic lip care can go a long way, so if your lips are prone to drying out, start applying the lip balm before you meet up with your intended kissing partner.


Lip balm can be used by men and women alike. Men with an aversion to lip care products should at least consider using an unscented, matte balm to maintain a certain degree of moisture.
Women can wear glosses, lip stains, and lipsticks, as well, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Avoid sticky glosses or lip products that contain glitter. Something will a little sheen can make your lips seem more kissable, but you don't want your lips to look unnaturally wet, either.If you don't have time to moisten your lips before the kiss, quickly run your tongue over your lips to add a little more moisture.







, No matter how far the kiss goes, your partner will inevitably end up smelling your breath. Bad breath can make an otherwise good kiss turn sour, so keep your mouth clean and your breath fresh before you lean in.


Brush your teeth and your tongue shortly before the kiss, if possible. A quick swish of mouthwash could also help in a pinch.
Avoid eating foods with strong odors before the kiss: garlic, curry, and so on.
Suck on a mint before the kiss when all else fails. Even better, cleanse the palette by sipping on green tea before the kiss. Some studies suggest that an odor-free kiss leaves a stronger impression than a minty one, and green tea can help freshen breath without imparting its own odor or taste., Move to a relatively secluded area so that the two of you can lose yourselves in the kiss without embarrassment or the threat of outside distraction.


Aside from privacy, location can also influence the mood between you. There's a reason that candlelight dinners, rain storms, and starlit camping trips can be so romantic.
Location isn't the only distraction you might deal with, of course. Cell phones are one of the most common sources of distractions nowadays, so turn yours off before you try setting the mood., Know if and when your partner is ready to kiss. There's nothing wrong with a little spontaneity now and then, but no one will enjoy a forced kiss. If you want to give the perfect kiss, you need to verify that your partner is welcome to receiving it.


Look for signs that indicate your partner's eagerness to be kissed: a gaze that frequently drops to your mouth, a tendency to lick his or her own lips, seemingly casual touches, and a dip in his or her tone of voice.Also watch out for signs that your partner isn't interested being kissed: eyes that dart in every direction but yours, pursed lips, tense or ""closed off"" body language, and a lack of interest in personal topics of conversation.

, Close the gap between you and your partner. The two of you should already be touching in some way before you move in for a kiss.


A kiss that follows an embrace can be powerful if performed while your upper halves are still touching. Even if you don't kiss following a hug, your body language should be prepped as though an embrace would be both natural and welcome.

, This is when you should be gazing with longing admiration into your partner's eyes. The perfect kiss needs to convey both desire and esteem, and the simplest way for you to get it right is to set the stage before you start the play.


An effective way to build desire is to plant small, soft kisses on the face, just outside of the mouth. Gentle caresses along your partner's face have a similarly strong impact. You could even brush your fingertips along your partner's lips.
Eye contact is of vital importance during this step. Gazing into your partner's eyes will make him or her feel more bonded to you, which will give the kiss a greater sense of intimacy when it finally does happen.

, Move in slowly, bringing your lips to your partner's for a quick, light kiss. Your partner's reaction will tell you everything you need to know—most notably, whether or not you should continue.

, If your partner enjoyed your test run, then start in with the real deal. Tilt your head to the right and plant another closed mouth kiss directly on your partner's lips, applying a little more pressure than before.


Research suggests that tilting your head to the right makes a kiss seem more caring and more meaningful. It's not a strictly vital move, but it can make a difference in your partner's interpretation of the kiss.

, With each kiss, linger for a moment before pulling your lips away. Hesitating before you move away suggests that you don't want the kiss to end. This demonstration of desire is more likely to grow your partner's desire, as well, leading to a more satisfying kissing experience.


Taking your time lets your partner know that you value the moment just as much as you value the sense of physical pleasure derived from the kiss. This sort of emotional intimacy is what strengthens the intensity of the kiss.

, You might be losing yourself in the kiss, but that doesn't necessarily mean that your partner feels the same way. If your partner is sending signals that he or she wants the moment to end, let it end. There's no sense in forcing something that is no longer wanted.


The simplest thing to remember is this: if your partner moves into your kiss, you're in good shape. If your partner tries to back away from your kiss, he or she is trying to put an end to it.

, While you're still in the closed mouth kissing stage, start heating things up by alternating slow kisses with quick kisses, and light kisses with aggressive kisses. Doing so introduces a slight element of surprise to the experience, which can make the experience more exciting for both of you.

, After you've indulged in some heavy closed mouth kissing, try a few kisses with your lips parted. If your partner finds the kiss as enjoyable as you do, he or she will probably follow your lead and open up, as well.


When you first move into an open mouth kiss, do so in the middle of a closed mouth kiss. Bring your closed lips to your partner's, then slowly part your lips while they're still locked with his or hers.
For every open mouth kiss—including French kisses—you should keep your lips soft and slightly open. You need to create a seal between your mouth and your partner's mouth. Opening your mouth too wide can cause saliva to gather and drip in very unappealing ways. There are exceptions, of course, but this is a general rule of thumb worth following as you try to get to know your partner's kissing style.

, If things have been going well and you want to progress to a French kiss, give your partner a subtle indication of your intent. Lightly run the tip of your tongue over your partner's bottom lip.


While there is no set time limit, this exploratory stage should usually last around 30 seconds. If your partner doesn't like the sensation of your tongue, then by that point, you'll likely know it.

, The key phrase, however, is “a little.” Use your tongue to explore and gently stroke the inside of your partner's mouth, but don't be too invasive about it. The idea is to touch sensitive nerves in the mouth to enhance the experience, but that purpose gets lost if you suffocate your partner with too much at once.

, Take your partner's lower lip in between your lips and gently suck on it for a few seconds before letting go. Similarly, you can also try a gentle nibble on your partner's lower lip for a few seconds.As with French kissing, less is more when it comes to nibbling and sucking. Be gentle about it. The idea is to cause a small enough amount of pain to release more endorphins or feel-good hormones, but you probably don't want to leave a mark when you're done.

, Your lips aren't the only thing you need to move during a kiss. As the kiss deepens, you need to draw your partner in even closer than before. Your hands should do their own share of exploring—just remember not to cross any boundaries that your partner might not be ready to cross.


Use your hands to caress your partner's neck, sides, or back. You could also run your fingers through your partner's hair.
If you have trouble keeping your hands in motion, you should at least settle for a tight, secure embrace., Your partner's lips aren't the only place you can kiss once things get more passionate. The neck, in particular, is a good area to switch to once things heat up.


Try zeroing in on the area between your partner's throat and chin. The skin is thinner there, which means that the nerves are closer together. As a result, the sensory receptors respond more favorably to a kiss planted in that area.

, Ultimately, there reaches a point where you need to trust your instincts more than anything else. Don't try to control kiss. The chemistry between you and your partner will do most of the work. You just need to interpret that chemistry and act accordingly.

It is initially red in color, due to broken blood vessels beneath the skin. It will later turn purple or dark brown as it heals.;
, Hickeys are a mark of passion. They are often done in the heat of the moment, out of desire for the other person. Giving someone a hickey is kind of like marking your territory, showing the world that this person belongs to you.


A hickey can be given and received by both guys and girls -- it's not gender exclusive!, A hickey is a sexual mark, which makes it inappropriate for school, work, or visiting grandparents. Some people may wish to avoid the embarrassment of being caught with a hickey, or the hassle of trying to cover one up, so you should never give one without sussing out your partner's feelings on the matter first.


In addition, receiving a hickey can be somewhat painful, which is a mood killer for some people. You have been warned!

, Don't just dive directly onto your partner's neck and go in for the hickey. Spend some time kissing and French kissing first, then move your lips to your partner's throat. Start with light kisses, then move into harder and more insistent kisses around the throat and collarbone. If your partner seems to enjoy it, you're probably clear to move into giving a hickey.


""Hickey"" isn't the sexiest word to whisper into someone's ear, so if you've avoided asking for permission til now, you should mention that you'd like to leave a mark on your partner's neck and see how he or she responds.

, Hickeys work best on thin, delicate skin, which is why they are usually found on the neck. However, the skin in the crook of your elbow or on the inner thigh are also prime locations.


If you know your partner would be extremely embarrassed at having a visible hickey, don't just put it in the middle of the throat where anyone can see.
The side or the back of the neck is a good bet if your partner has long hair, or you could go to the collarbones, closer to the shoulder, so the skin can be covered by a regular crew-neck T-shirt.

, Imagine you are making the letter ""O"" with your lips, then press them firmly onto your partner's skin so that you can make a good seal, without leaving any gaps for the air to escape. Try to keep your mouth soft and inviting as you do this, instead of going into a hard pucker.

, The key here is to suck hard enough to break the capillaries just beneath the skin, but not so hard that you cause your partner too much pain. You will need to suck for 20 to 30 seconds in order to make a mark. Remember:


Keep your teeth out of the way. You don't want them digging painfully into your partner's skin.
Break up the sucking. If 30 solid seconds of hickey-making strikes you as too weird, try 10 seconds, some kissing, then another 10 seconds in the same spot, and so on.
Control the amount of spit in your mouth. You don't want to be leaving a creepy drip of slobber on your partner's neck as you give a hickey, so try to swallow back any excess.

, When you're done sucking, try laying a few gentle kisses on the area, which probably feels more sensitive now. Resume making out as usual.

, Just as when you get a bruise, you won't be able to see the hickey immediately. It should show up after 5 or 10 minutes, and could be anywhere from light pink to dark purple.

, If you want the hickey to be larger or darker, return to the same spot and repeat the process again.

, Maybe your girlfriend thinks she's cool with having a hickey, but she hates the way that it feels while you're doing it. Or your boyfriend decides he can't risk his parents or employer seeing the mark. Always respect your partner's wishes if they say ""no,"" even if you've already started the process. A hickey is sometimes seen as a mark of trust, so abusing that trust is not okay.

, A little heavy make-up or concealer can be pretty effective for covering up a hickey. Just make sure you get a color that matches your skin tone exactly, and that you blend it in well, otherwise it will look too obvious.Stage make up is extra thick and heavy, so you may resort to that if you're trying to conceal a real whopper.

, A scarf is your best friend when attempting to conceal a hickey on your neck, as a scarf is a fashionable item which no one will question you wearing (unless it's 100 degrees outside). Wrap the scarf strategically around your neck, and make sure to check it in a mirror from time to time to make sure the material hasn't moved, leaving your hickey exposed.


Other options for covering a neck hickey include wearing a turtleneck (again, when weather conditions allow) or wearing your hair down, if it's long enough.

, A band aid will effectively cover up a hickey and give it time to heal away from the prying eyes of the world. However, having a band aid on your neck can also look pretty obvious, so you'll have to come up with a plausible excuse for wearing it, like ""I burned myself with my flat iron"" or ""I popped a zit"".


If you received the hickey on the crook of your arm, you're in luck, as you can claim to have donated blood and therefore act like a hero!

, Arnica cream is said to speed up the healing of bruises, so it may also be effective for clearing up hickeys. There are numerous other home remedies that supposedly help to speed up healing, such as applying an ice pack, rubbing the hickey with a comb, scraping the hickey with a coin and covering the hickey with toothpaste.All of these methods, and more, are outlined in the article How to Remove a Hickey.

Take your time.",How to Give an Unforgettable Kiss1," To quote a song worth kissing to, “If you think that is a kiss is all in the lips, come on, you’ve got it all wrong.” The intensity of a kiss is determined by so much more than the kiss itself, and eye contact is where many kisses begin.Intentionally pause right before impact for a moment of pure and unadulterated eye contact.
A powerful moment of eye contact can actually be the breaking point of passion, pulling you in to one another for a kiss that is already unforgettable.
Break eye contact by looking at their lips. Let them know what you’re thinking about with your eyes.;
, This is harder than you think. The better the kiss, the worse your memory. That said, oxygen-deprivation is a far-too-common reason that kisses do not achieve their full potential.Make breathing breaks sexy by allowing your partner to feel your breath, though only barely.
Evince your nervous energy and excitement with flattering exhalations.
It’s a deeply gratifying feeling to literally take someone’s breath away. If someone takes yours, make sure they know it.

Time and space will distort accordingly.That said, don’t hold back. Don’t feel as though you should hesitate and let your partner lead, unless this is what you want and have been clear about your desires. If you’re interested, act like it and initiate!
Immerse yourself fully in every kiss, but especially the first few times your lips touch one another’s. Allow yourself the freedom and enjoyment of fully enjoy another person’s affection.
When you pull away, your eyes will already be sharing exactly how you felt about the endeavor, and you’ll already have forgotten everything else about your day.

Kiss during moments of intense intimacy.",How to Give an Unforgettable Kiss2," Plenty of high quality kisses will turn wet and sloppy at some point. They shouldn’t ever start that way. Allow you and your partner to enjoy the rising swell of arousal by kissing softly and slowly at first.Following an initial few exploratory kisses, withdraw and work the eye contact. You’ll likely both lean in for more without thinking at all.
It’s better to keep each other wanting more than over-imposing yourself early in a potential kiss-a-thon. There’s no rush.
Try starting a kiss somewhere other than your lover’s lips. The neck, the eyes, the ears; each of these are intimate parts of the body that will excitedly receive a well-timed kiss.

, You and your kissing counterpart have to work together if you want to knock each other’s socks off. Think of kissing like dancing – with all sorts of styles and ways to move. What matters most is staying in tune with one another.If you’re already overthinking everything right out of the gate, focus on the way their lips feel against yours, and your thoughts will likely return to the kiss.
Heat things up. One option is to gently bite. Pull softly on their lower lip. Not everyone will enjoy this, but most will, and will likely follow in whatever direction your teeth are pulling them.
Introduce the tongue. Slowly and methodically drag the tip of your tongue along the edges of your partner’s lips.
Use the texture and pressure of your tongue to introduce the notion that there is plenty more to look forward to in the coming moments.Use your tongue according to your partner’s response. If your tongues have taken control and have already started to wrestle in one another’s mouths, you likely don’t have cause to hesitate. That said, don’t forget that kissing is a full-body endeavor.

, Let your appendages wander. The best way to begin to explore the creative potential of a kiss if to literally feel the energy your partner’s body is emanating. Begin to roam (with either hand or mouth) from the base of their neck down their spine.Don’t allow yourself to overthink what you’re doing with your hands. Don’t allow them to rest anywhere for too long.
Never touch anyone anywhere they have not consented to being touched. The first few times you kiss someone, you need to explore one another’s boundaries carefully by making a point of respecting limits to the sorts of touching you’re each comfortable including in a kiss.
Some classic extracurricular hand placements include the back of the head, the deep lower back, and along or just below your partner’s jaw.

, Don’t risk boring each other by repeating the same motion or action over and over. Maintaining variety in the way you’re touching and kissing will keep the session interesting.Alternate between long, slow kisses and popcorn-kettle kisses that jump around from place to unpredictable place.
Don’t forget to break away from time to time to allow one another to breathe deeply and exchange make contact with your eyes. This also allows you to communicate some form of telepathic creative inspiration that will be evident when the kissing resumes.
Reinitiate kissing your partner by targeting a new part of their body.
As you learn where your lover enjoys being kissed, returned to those areas and enjoy the reaction your lips elicit.

, Of all the places a kiss may lead, extreme intimacy is an especially popular destination. Don’t allow your acts of intimacy to become routine. Use your lips to maintain surprise, compassion, and variability when having sex.Sexual relationships are remarkably varied. As long as you and your partner openly communicate, sex can be healthy in all sorts of way. That said, fulfillment is often derived in part via a romantic connection – which can be conveyed immediately by a tender kiss.
During and after moments of full-body contact, don’t allow your excitement to prevent your enjoyment of wrapping one another in a fury of arms, hips, legs, and shoulders. Kiss all of one another with your lips; kiss them with every other part of your body as well.

Take care of your mouth.,
Value kissing in and of itself.,
Listen to your partner – including their breathing.,
Kiss mindfully.",How to Give an Unforgettable Kiss3," This one doesn’t require too much elaboration. Brush your teeth twice a day. Mess around with mouthwash. Carry mints.Metaphorically, the care you take in maintaining a kissable mouth shows a potential kissing partner that you take care of yourself generally. This is an extremely significant aspect of attraction.
Floss. Albeit the least fun oral hygiene task, flossing might have the greatest positive impact on mouth cleanliness.
Soften those lips. Chapstick and lip gloss can make a big difference in preventing lip dryness. You can always employ natural wetness – and perhaps set the tone – by licking your lips., Know that different people will approach and respond to kissing differently. Kissing, pure and simple, can be an incredibly exciting, enjoyable act. It is also an integral component of a healthy relationship.Some may value the intimacy and tenderness of kissing, favoring the compassion of a kiss as much as the passion it brings to mind.
Don’t ever assume anything about what anyone prefers on account of their gender – that’s not only prejudiced, it’s simply inaccurate.
Do not view kissing predominantly as a prelude to sex. While sex is a fun and healthy aspect of many relationships that also include kissing, it is important to recognize that someone’s interest in kissing you does not at all indicate that they are willing to have sex.

, You can tell whether someone is enjoying themselves by how they’re breathing. Contribute to the heat of the moment by allowing one another to become aware of each other’s breath. When you’re unsure of anything, pause and simply listen to your partner breathe.Your partner may sometimes be more comfortable if you tone it down a bit. Your tongue, for instance, can be a key element of a kiss, but so should your lips, hands, and the openness of both of your airwaves.
Match your partner’s tempo. And recall the dancing metaphor. Take turns leading one another wherever your mind and body take you. Enjoy sharing the pattern of pushing and pulling with your partner, whatever that means for the two of you.

, The contemporary, breakneck pace of life has permeated even our most intimate relationships. Don’t let this diminish the quality of your kisses, nor the depth of your intimacy. Practice mindfulness in the most integral physical aspect of your romantic relationships by kissing with intention.Take two minutes a day to stop with your partner in the middle of the everyday chaos and share a spontaneous, fully-focused, drawn-out kiss.
Focus on the weight and meaning of the exact moment in which you’re living. Fully experiencing yourself and your partner is the best way to ensure the kiss is meditatively unforgettable.

Some girls can be insecure, and love getting reassured a lot. To be affectionate, just give her a gentle touch, put your arm around her, hold her hand, or do whatever you can do to give her a little bit of physical touch. This doesn't mean you have to use everything you have on her, pick the right moments to let her know you care and it'll mean a lot more than having your arm around her for four hours.


Giving her a little kiss on the cheek or a squeeze of the hand is another way to be affectionate.
If holding hands isn't your thing, you can put your hand on the small of her back when you're walking.;
, If you want to love your girl, then you have to support her as much as you can. Being supportive means anything from showing up to her soccer games to encouraging her to apply for a job even if she's worried she won't get an interview. You should be there to lift her up, not put her down, and let her know you think she's amazing and capable of anything she puts her mind to. This doesn't mean you have to follow her around and be her cheerleader at all times, she should support you too, but it does mean that you should let her know that you will help her succeed in any way she wants.


Sometimes, this may mean just supporting her when she is upset, sad, or confused. You have to be there for her during the good times and the bad.

, You don't have to transform your whole personality and start throwing your jacket over puddles to show the girl you love her. However, if you want to show her that you care, then yeah, you should probably stop belching and scratching yourself when you're hanging out. Otherwise, she'll feel like one of the guys, and you have to make an effort to make her feel different from your bros. Make sure to hold open doors for her, pull out her chair when you're on a dinner date, let her walk in front of you when you walk into a place, and give her your jacket when she's cold.


Being a gentleman will make her feel like you're paying special attention to her. If you want her to feel loved, then you've got to make that extra effort.

, It can be hard for a lot of guys to know what it means to be thoughtful. Basically, it means that you should really put some thought and effort into how you treat your girl, based on what you think she will or will not like. So, take the time to really listen to her when she speaks, and to know what makes her tick. If it's the morning before her dance recital, send her flowers. If she's having a rough week, write her a love letter. If you're at the movies, get up to get her her favorite snack. Take the time to get to know what will make her happy, and make the effort to give that to her.


If you know she's feeling low, acknowledge her moods and say, ""I can imagine that you would feel..."" while you shouldn't say you know exactly how she feels, put in the effort to let her know you've thought about what's going through her head.
Pay attention. If she mentions a book she'd like to read or a new album she hasn't heard yet, give them to her as a small gift. She might say, ""I can't believe you remembered that!"" Now, that's love.

, If you want to love the girl, then you have to be understanding of the fact that she's only human and has flaws, needs, and desires, just like everyone else. You can't expect her to be perfect or to live up to some unreasonable expectations. If she makes a mistake, don't spend weeks being resentful and being dismissive of her. If she flakes on you once, don't sulk about it for days. Obviously, if she mistreats you constantly, then you should reevaluate your relationship, but if she has a few bad days here and there, don't act like it's the end of the world.


Think about it: maybe she's having a really hard time adjusting to a demanding new job. Maybe she's suffering emotionally because her grandmother or mother recently passed away. Try to see things from her perspective before you get angry or start a fight.

, Part of loving a girl is knowing when you should back off a little bit. Maybe she's had a bad week and really wants to be alone; respect that. Maybe she wants to have a night out with her girlfriends; tell her you hope she has a great time and don't text her every five seconds to make sure she's not flirting with some other guy. If you don't smother her, she'll feel your love more, and she'll love the fact that you respect her individuality.


However, it can be tricky. You have to recognize whether she really doesn't need your support, or if she's just saying that because she doesn't want to be a burden. You have to figure this one out on a case by case basis.

, If you want to love a girl, then you have to make some romantic gestures to let her know that you really care about her. Don't do anything that feels forced or just completely unnatural to you, but make an effort to make your girl feel extra special. This can mean sending her flowers, buying her a box of chocolates, or doing something a bit more original that reflects on the nature of your relationship. Here are some other ways you can be romantic:


Write her a sweet message in a card just because.
Make her a delicious home cooked meal.
Tell her you love her at the right moments.
Write or recite her a poem.
Take her dancing.
Go on a moonlit walk.
Have an impromptu picnic.
Take her to a jazz concert.
Write love notes to her.
Serenade her with love songs.

, If you are used to keeping your thoughts and feelings to yourself, try speaking up more often. Maybe you don't open up because that also means opening yourself up to being teased or rejected, but by being more open, your relationship with this girl can become more intimate, and love thrives on intimacy. You don't have to tell her every little thing about yourself right away, but you should work on being more open and telling her things you don't normally tell anyone. This will show her that you love her and that she stands out from the rest.


Being open relates to being honest. Though you don't have to tell her about how you saw a cute girl walking by that day, you should be as honest as you can without needlessly hurting her.
If she's opening up to you a lot and you don't give her a lot to work with, then she may feel like you're not as invested in the relationship. Of course, some guys are a lot less open than others, but you should work on being as open as you can with her while still feeling like you're being yourself.

, Get to know her. Show her that you're interested in who she is as a person, what she's thinking, and what she's been up to. You don't have to interrogate her to make her feel like you really care about her. When you're together, ask her how her day went. Ask about her plans for the next day. When you really get to know each other, ask her about her plans for the future. Here are some other things you can ask her about to let her know you love her:


Her passions
Her friendships
Her family
Her worries and fears
Her goals
Her everyday life

, If you want to love a girl, then you have to let her know she is loved. This doesn't mean you have to compliment her every five seconds, or it will begin to feel like you're not being sincere. Instead, just giving her a few meaningful and unique compliments can be much more effective than giving her so many compliments that she doesn't even hear them anymore. Work to compliment a unique aspect of her personality or her looks, or something else about her. Here are some examples of compliments you can give her:


""You're so good at staying positive in the middle of a bad time. I wish I knew how to do that.""
""Your friends all love you so much. You're so supportive.""
""I love the color of your eyes. I've never seen eyes with flecks of hazel like that.""

, If you want to love her, then you have to view her as an equal. You can't just treat her like a prize or a trophy; let her know that her opinions matter to you. Make an effort to ask her what she thinks about everything from current events to what you should do with your life. Take the time to pick her brain and see how she really feels about things; girls need to feel like you respect their intelligence. Here are some things you can ask her about:


What you should do in a certain situation
Current events
Her thoughts on movies, albums, and books
Anything you're unsure about

, You should also pay attention to what you say when you're not with the girl. While you shouldn't call her and text her every five seconds, you should make an effort to let her know you're thinking about her when you're not together. If you're apart for a day or two, make sure to call her or text her to check in so she knows you're thinking about her. If she's away for the weekend for something big like a wedding or tournament, make sure to see how it went. Let her know that you don't just stop thinking about her the second you're apart.


On the other hand, don't make her feel smothered. If you know she's going to be super busy, you have to be comfortable with letting her do her own thing instead of getting in her way.

, Sometimes, when she says she doesn't want to talk about it, she really means it. If something bad happened to her, she may just need some time for it to sink in. Don't bother her or pry too much if you can tell she's really just not in the mood to talk about it. This can make her more agitated and even less likely to want to talk to you. You may feel like the best way to show your love is to keep bothering her to talk, but sometimes the best way to show your love is just to back away a little bit.

, If you want to love a girl, then you have to let her know when you've made a mistake. If you've done something wrong, it's important to apologize -- and mean it. Don't just deny what you did and hope that you can both move on with your lives. If you want the girl to really love and respect you and to see that you care for her, then it's important to apologize when you've made a mistake and to make an effort not to do it again.


Look her in the eyes when you apologize. Show her that you really care.
Don't say, ""I'm sorry that you were upset when I…"" Really make it clear that you know that you have made a mistake.

, If you want to love a girl, then you have to know how to talk to her. This means being able to tell your side of the story while also hearing her out. It means learning to compromise, to find a way to make each other feel happy. It means listening to your girl without interrupting. And it also means picking your battles. You should work on having much more positive interactions than fights, and on letting her know how you really feel instead of keeping your feelings bottled up inside.


If you want your love to last, then it's absolutely important to remember that it's better to be happy than to be right. Work on finding a way to make you both feel respected and fulfilled than just on getting your way all the time.

, If you want to show your love to your girl long term, then you've got to have at least a few things that you love to do together. This can be going on long morning hikes, reading together at a coffee shop, checking out your favorite museums on Sundays, going to see your favorite band play live, or really anything that makes you both happy and that you love doing together. While you shouldn't have all of the same interests, you should have at least a few things that you both care about so you can make your love last.


As relationships progress, it's easy for couples to feel like they have nothing in common anymore. That's why it's important to find things that you always love doing together.
If both of you are getting sick of one of your favorite interests, don't just drop it. Find something to do in its place.

, Though it's important to find a comfortable routine of doing a few things that you love together, it's equally important to mix things up and to do new things as often as you can. Maybe you've been playing pool together for years, and it's time to switch to darts. Maybe you've been vacationing in Tahoe every summer; it could be time to try Yosemite. Make an effort to do new things together so you can love your girl forever.


Be spontaneous. Though planning is great, so is taking a surprise last minute trip, or buying tickets to a concert at the last second.

, If you want to love your girl, then you have to love her and yourself as individuals. Make sure you don't lose sight of who you are as a person and she'll love you even more and see that you love her more for it. If you continue to follow your own interests, spend time with your friends, and do some things apart, you'll actually be loving your girl even more because you'll be showing that you're comfortable enough with your relationship that you don't have to spend every second together.


And make sure she maintains her independence, too. If you're both going out into the world and doing your own thing, you'll have more to talk about when you're together. If you're spending 24/7 together, then you'll quickly run out of things to talk about.

, It doesn't matter if you've been together for 8 or 80 years. You always have to make the effort to tell your girl you love her, whether you just say it, or you write it in a card. Never think that you don't have to say ""I love you"" because your girl should know how you feel. That's just never the case. Tell her you love her in the morning, in the evening, or whenever the moment strikes you. Just don't let a day go by without saying it.


There's a difference between saying, ""Love you!"" and, ""I love you."" Make the effort to really say it.

, If you want to love a girl, then you have to keep the passion and romance in your relationship alive. Even if you're living together or even married, it doesn't mean you have to stop being romantic because you've been together so long. Remember that the chase is never over and that you have to work on setting a romantic mood, making your girl feel special and loved, and taking the time to pay attention to your girl.


Stick to your date nights. Don't let anything get in the way of that weekly time you spend together.
You should both really dress up and go out for a nice, romantic dinner once in a while just to keep your love strong, no matter how busy you are.
Never stop trying to charm or romance your girlfriend. If you want to make love last, then you should both always continue to make an effort.
Never interrupt her while she is talking or talk back to her. It is rude and disrespectful.

Know what a hickey is.,
Give a hickey only with consent.,
Give her a hickey in the heat of the moment.,
Move your lips slowly down the girl’s neck.,
Open your mouth, slightly.,
Deliver the hickey.,
Check for a hickey.,
Tell her about the hickey.",How to Give a Girl a Hickey," A hickey is a bruise left behind in the heat of passion. You'll create a hickey by gently breaking blood vessels through the suction of lips against sensitive skin. This is a mark of love, and a visible display that you've been intimate with someone. Be aware of the implications!
, You are leaving a noticeable mark on someone's neck, here, so you should be sure that she's into it before you go for the hickey. Of course, it might spoil the mood to ask, ""Do you mind if I give you a hickey?"" Consider that she might be embarrassed by this love-mark: she may not want her friends, family, or teachers to know that she is sexually or romantically active, and she may feel the need to hide the spot with makeup or a scarf. Some people proudly display their hickeys, while others are mortified.A hickey is a playful mark of possession – a brand of passion. In general, a girlfriend or emotionally-involved partner will be more receptive to a hickey than someone you met that night.
Consider whether a hickey is necessarily the ""goal"" of your encounter with this girl. It can be fun to give or receive a hickey, in the heat of the moment, but you shouldn't put all of your focus on bruising and ""branding"" her. Take your time, and make her feel amazing!

, Don't just suck on her neck without any buildup. The hickey is best delivered during a heated make-out or lovemaking session, in the height of passion, when it feels the most sensual. Wait until you've been kissing this girl for at least a few minutes. If you are having sex, the hickey is even more appropriate, and any pain from the mark will be wrapped up into the experience.


Be aware that pain can be a serious mood-killer for some people. It's not for everyone!

, Whether you are making love or just making out, nibble her neck and give her light kisses. Most hickeys are given on the neck, as a result of the delicate pressure of the lips on the sensitive skin.There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" part of the neck. However, she'll be able to hide it more easily if it's low, near her collarbone, or high on the neck, such that it falls beneath her hair.


The neck may be the most popular spot, but you can technically give a hickey to any area of sensitive skin. For a less visible and more intimate mark, try giving her a hickey on the top of her breast or the inside of her upper thigh.

, As you are kissing her neck, form a circle with your lips on the spot of your choice. Do not slobber – just keep kissing, and prepare to give her the hickey.


Use your best judgment on how long to build up before the hickey. If the two of you are very intimate, then it won't seem too strange to get into kissing her neck for a while.
Don't just spend a few minutes kissing the same spot! Kiss all over her neck and face, and consider lightly nibbling her skin. Add some variety and make it interesting.

, Create suction by inhaling lightly as you kiss the area. Breathe out through your nose and in through your mouth to slightly increase the force of the suction. Keep your mouth in the same place for up to 30 seconds to deliver the hickey.


You can also try biting her neck with the tips of your teeth, extremely gently, in a sort of ""love-nip."" Test the waters by nibbling her neck, Be very careful not to hurt her!
Stop if she asks you to stop. Consent is not a one-time promise – it is a constantly-changing agreement. If she decides that she's no longer comfortable with the situation, then it is your responsibility as a decent human being to back off and respect her wishes.

, The spot that you sucked should be red and slightly swollen. If the redness disappears over the next minute, you can try again. Suck in slightly harder, this time, so that you break blood vessels on the surface of the skin.

, Be considerate. She may not want the world to know that she has a hickey. She may at least want to hide the mark in certain situations – like when she's around her parents. For her sake, and yours, give her a heads-up so that she can conceal the hickey with makeup, a scarf, or a high collar.

You are committed to sticking together even through the most difficult circumstances. You can tell this person anything about yourself, even if the truth doesn't flatter you, and you know that your partner will accept you. There is no way to make a person love you, although actions do speak louder than words. If you are the one always giving and getting very little in return, you might consider asking a trusted friend or family member, one with your best interests at heart, what they see. Most of the time those on the outside are more likely to see things that you don't because love is blind.;
, You know that your partner will stand by you no matter what, and you are prepared to commit to your partner for the rest of your life.

, You have known the person for a long time, and you can't imagine life without him or her. You want to know everything about the person and want to spend time getting to know them on a deeper level.

, Something funny has happened to you at work, and you can't wait to tell your partner. Alternatively, you've had a bad experience, and you want to talk to someone who will understand. If your partner is the first person that you think about when you want to share your innermost thoughts, then you may be in love. You have mutual respect for each other.

, When you have an argument with your partner, you keep working until you are able to find some common ground. No argument can erase your commitment to one another, and you appreciate your partner speaking the truth even when it's painful. Even if you don't agree with your partner you will always take their side and defend them in front of your family and friends.

, You feel comfortable with your partner, and you feel a strong bond of trust. They should feel like your partner, in that marriage or moving in together feels natural because life is better with them. Your family and friends should know all about the person, and you have the reflex to stand up and protect the person from any nay-sayers. , When you experience infatuation, your mind is consumed by thoughts of the other person. You're thinking not only about the other person but also about how you want to reveal yourself to the other person. You have an idealized vision of what this person is like, and your vision may or may not be accurate.

, Instead of feeling secure, you are thinking more about how to impress the other person. Your focus is on how to get the other person to like you, and you feel nervous because you don't know how the other person feels.

, Your relationship is pretty new, and while you're constantly thinking about the other person, you're not confident that he or she has what it takes to go the distance.

, You think constantly about the way that the person smiles, the way he or she says your name or the way that your partner looks at you. You think obsessively about these details, and you try to decide how the person feels about you based on these somewhat trivial qualities.

, The person you like disagrees with you, and you wonder if the relationship is over. You wonder whether you know the person at all or whether your impressions have been wrong all along.

, You want to ask the person to date exclusively, but you're nervous about what he or she might say. You're afraid that asking for commitment may frighten the person away. Your feelings aren't deep enough for love; you're probably more in the realm of infatuation.

, If you're looking to catch someone as a prize or to get someone to go to bed with you, you're treating the person like a thing, and you're probably experiencing lust.

, Security isn't important to you; you're more interested in the score and in how great it feels to be physical together. After you get what you want, you can take or leave the other person.

, You're trying to figure out what you have to do to get this person to invite you up for a nightcap.

, Who cares if you have an argument? You can find someone new without the hassle of bickering, fighting and drama. The sex is great, but it's not worth the baggage, unless it's make-up sex after one of those passionate arguments.

Love yourself unconditionally.,
Make the loving choice.,
Forgive those you love.,
Don’t expect to shield someone you love from all discomfort and pain.,
Love more by “caring” less.,
Accept yourself and those you love as is.",How to Love Unconditionally," The ancient Greeks did so, and defined four variations, as identified in How to Define Love. Of the four, the term agape most closely equates to unconditional love. Agape love is a choice, a decision made to love regardless of circumstances or disappointments.


Thus, unconditional love means loving another in their essence, as they are, no matter what they do or fail to do.People with children usually seem to understand this notion best of all.
It is also learned and practiced. You must choose to love unconditionally.Parents might counter that they had no choice but to love their children from the moment they laid eyes on them, but that initial flush of attachment is, perhaps imperceptibly, replaced by an ongoing decision to love the child regardless of circumstances.;
, A person who has newly fallen in love with another is often in this state, where they don't see the other person’s full reality, faults and all.Such a state of love is (or at least should be) temporary, and needs to be replaced by a longer-term, “eyes wide open” type of love if the love is to last.
To love someone without conditions you need to be aware of the conditions, good and bad.
""Unconditional Love is not the case of being blinded by love but rather the resolution that nothing is more important than love."" - Talidari

, Some say no, because romantic love must function conditionally, as a partnership based on feelings, actions, and expectations. In this view, you can never love your spouse in the same unconditional manner as your child.However, love is not the same thing as a relationship. Relationships are conditional, a “working partnership.” An unconditional relationship is a recipe for one-sided domination.Thus, a relationship can end because the partnership does not function properly, and yet unconditional love toward the other person can remain. Sometimes ending a relationship can be the way to love unconditionally.

, We usually consider love to be a feeling, but feelings are a response to something we “get” from someone or something. Therefore, feelings are conditional.


Unconditional love is the action, the choice to strive for the well-being of another. The feeling you derive from acting with love is your reward, the return you “get” from your own action.
To love unconditionally is to act with love under all conditions.
If you have to do something, or be a certain way, in order to receive love, that love is conditional. If it is given to you freely and without reservation, it is unconditional.

, Unconditional love starts at home, with oneself. You know your own flaws and shortcomings better than anyone else, and better than you can ever know anyone else’s. Being able to love yourself despite this unsurpassable awareness of your own faults puts you in the position to be able to offer the same to others.


Thus, you must be able to recognize, accept, and forgive your own imperfections in order to do the same for someone else.If you cannot deem yourself worthy of being loved unconditionally, you’ll never truly be able to deem yourself worthy of offering it., Always ask yourself, “What is the most loving thing I can do for this particular person in this particular moment?”. Love isn't one size fits all; what might be a loving act toward one person could be harmful to another person, in that it doesn't help them get closer to becoming a truly happy human being.


Unconditional love is a new decision you need to make in every situation, not a hard and fast rule you can apply to everyone all the time.
For instance, if you have two friends dealing with the loss of a loved one, being the shoulder to cry on and engaging in long talks may be the loving choice for one, while granting some distance and silence may be so for the other.

, Even if someone doesn't apologize, it's inherently loving to both them and yourself to let go of your anger and resentment toward them. Keep in mind Piero Ferrucci's advice that forgiving ""is not something we do, but something we are.""In religious terms, you’ll hear the phrase “hate the sin, love the sinner.” Loving someone unconditionally does not mean liking every action they take or choice they make; it means not letting such things interfere with your desire for the best for that person in all things.If someone you love says something hurtful in anger, the loving choice is usually to let them know those words hurt you, but also to forgive their indiscretion. Help them to grow and yet know that they are loved.
But don't mistake being willing to forgive for letting people walk all over you. Extricating yourself from an environment in which you are repeatedly mistreated or taken advantage of can be a loving choice for both yourself and the other person.

, Part of loving someone is fostering their growth as a person, and pain and discomfort are an inescapable part of growth in this life. Unconditional love means doing what you can to make the other person happy and comfortable, but also helping them grow through their inevitable experiences of discomfort.


Don’t lie to “protect” the feelings of someone you love; support them in dealing with their feelings in the face of pain.
For example, lying about a dire financial situation to spare pain is likely to foster more pain and distrust in the long run. Instead, be honest, supportive, and eager to work together to find solutions.

, Wait, isn’t caring what love is all about? Yes, you want to “care” for a person in the sense that you strive for their well-being and happiness. You don’t want to “care” in the sense that your love is predicated on specific outcomes, which by definition is conditional.So, not “I don’t care what you decide ;” but instead “I don’t care what you decide .”
You don’t love in return for actions that make you happy; you derive happiness from the act of loving unconditionally.

, You are far from perfect, and yet you are perfectly capable of offering love; they are likewise imperfect, but worthy of being offered love.


Unconditional love is about acceptance—about not expecting others to make you happy through their choices and how they live. You can’t control others, only yourself.
Your brother may be notorious for his bad choices, but that should have no bearing upon your love for him. Don't love because of how someone lives, but simply because they live.

Enjoy your kissing!",How to Get Your Boyfriend to French Kiss You when He Doesn't Know How to," Some people need more time than others. It's normal for people to be inexperienced, and it's also normal for that person to feel self-conscious when they know that they are inexperienced.


If he has voiced his concern about not being ""good enough"" or not ""knowing how"", make it clear to him that you'd like to just try and that you won't judge him.;
, While it may sometimes be okay to read body language to determine whether he wants to, it is best to always ask. Getting consent before kissing someone (or engaging in any physical activity, especially intimate / sexual) is incredibly important.


It might feel kind of awkward but you should really just be frank about it. But don't be pushy, because it might come off as you being more worldly than he is, which could make him feel insecure. Above all else, listen to what he has to say and be sensitive and understanding about it.
Make sure he is comfortable about it as he could have a valid reason stopping him from doing so but doesn't want to tell you. For example, his culture or religion may forbid such activities.

, Choose a time and place where the mood is romantic and you have no chances of being interrupted and start out slow. Keep in mind the atmosphere, approach it as a game or fun activity not an assignment.


If he isn't comfortable, give him space and give him a choice.

, Talk to him about it and explain why you want to try it. Also, let him know that it's okay if he hasn't done it before or doesn't know how because you want to learn together.


If he is worried about it, don't push him. It is important to let people make these kinds of decisions at their own pace. It doesn't mean he doesn't like you or isn't interested - he may just be nervous, for example.

, If you both don't know how to french kiss, watch some tutorials together and even go as far as to ask people how they do it.


This may be awkward; you could ask a youthful family member like an older sibling or cousin for advice.

, If you have some experience with french kissing, try helping him with technique. For example, sit with him and say that you would like to french kiss with him, if he says something about his lack of skill just say that you can help because you've tried it before.

, You can ease into things by going for a simple peck or a kiss on the cheek.You can do things a bit slower than normal to signal that you're going in a different direction than what he is use to.

, When he is ready to try it, continue kissing the way you normally would until you are both comfortable enough to move forward.


Spend as much time as you need.

, When kissing on the lips seems to progress into a more passionate activity, begin to open your mouth, inviting interaction, hoping his mouth will follow your touch.Again, continue this way until you both feel ready to move forward.


Movement and pressure changes means he'll want to maintain contact. Some people like intense and immediate surprises, but it can vary from person to person., While kissing, open your mouth and lightly touch his lips with your tongue. If he opens his mouth, you're set!If he doesn't open his mouth, do not try to shove your tongue in anyway. Otherwise you might freak him out. Keeping his lips closed is basically his way of saying he doesn't feel ready.


You can start with the lower lip, passing to the top one and then, the moment of the truth, you're going to try to touch his tongue with yours.
Try teasing a bit, make him want more, he will respond.It might take a few sessions, so be patient and see if he will reciprocate.

, Some people like to use a lot of tongue, while others prefer to use only a small amount. A basic french kiss usually starts with gently introducing your tongues into each other's mouths.Don't push your tongue in too far or close both of your lips all the way over their mouth.
You can try flicking your tongue in and out quickly, running it along his lips / the edges of his teeth, sucking lightly on his tongue / lips, etc., Remember, that if either of you feels uncomfortable or wants to stop, you need to stop.

, Making sure the other person consents to any type of intimate activity is an ongoing process.If your boyfriend is still bad at it, or if there is anything that you do not like or would like to change, talk to him.

, A sigh or soft moan might signal your pleasure. Hold his head closer, stroke his hair, nibble his ears and whisper what you like.

, Offer advice for ways in which he could improve. You can always tell him what you like, since kissing is a great way to communicate.


If he does something weird or not to your liking just say ""Hey, like this"" and lead by example. It won't be perfect the first time but you guys will find a balance with practice.
Let him know that you're not upset or disappointed, but that you want to work together to make sure that both of you are enjoying your intimate moments.
Offer to show him what you like, which may put him more at ease.

, In a safe setting, use words of affirmation, like, ""That was so great, you're making me feel so wonderful when you..."", ""I really liked it when you..."", or, ""Please let me taste your tongue"", ""Did you like that as much as I did?""

, Talk about everything from the emotions that the two of you are feeling to the small things that you may think don’t matter. For example, if you are more comfortable kissing with music then let him know.

, Once you've talked about french kissing enough, don't be afraid to ask him what feels good and expect the same.

, Keep on practicing and have fun. If you do something wrong or somewhat embarrassing laugh it off and continue, and soon kissing will be fun.

Exfoliate your lips to make them soft.,
Moisturize your lips to keep them soft.,
Brush your teeth and tongue well in advance.",How to Give a Candy Flavored Kiss1," You don't want your lips hard or chapped and dry. Use an exfoliating lip scrub or a toothbrush dipped in petroleum jelly to remove any dead, flaky skin and leave your lips smooth and soft.


Make your own lip scrub by combining a pinch of brown sugar and a little honey, olive oil, or coconut oil.Gently rub the exfoliant or toothbrush over your lips using small, circular motions. Don't be too rough.Wipe your lips with a washcloth to remove all the petroleum jelly or lip exfoliator.;
, Instead of a lip gloss or chapstick, which can seal the skin on your lips and keep moisture out, look specifically for a lip moisturizer and apply it right after showering.Look for a lip moisturizer with vitamins A, B, and E which moisturize and help with absorbency.Use a few drops of vitamin-rich sesame seed oil if you are in a pinch., If you're going to use a real piece of candy and not a flavored lip gloss, the minty flavor of the toothpaste may interfere with the sweetness of the candy and create a bad taste. You definitely want to start with a clean mouth, however, so make sure you brush your teeth 30-60 minutes before you think you're going to kiss your partner, so the mint flavor has time to fade.


If you're planning to flavor your lips only, try to brush your teeth right before you meet your partner.

Buy a lollipop or candy in a flavor you know your partner likes.,
Wet the candy and rub it on your lips like a lipstick.,
Kiss your partner!",How to Give a Candy Flavored Kiss2," If you're not sure what he or she likes, try a safe, popular candy, either something minty or fruity. Most people like chocolate, but if you rub chocolate on your lips it will look sloppy and unappealing. It will also ruin the surprise!

, Try to keep it just on your lips, as it may leave a shine or stickiness that would look gross on the rest of your face. The flavor may not last very long, so make sure your partner is nearby, but not watching you.


You may want to let the candy dissolve in your mouth and on your tongue, but beware: the bacteria in your mouth loves sugar and this can cause bad breath!, If you think your partner is up for it, you may want to keep the candy in your mouth (if it's a hard candy, like a butterscotch or mint). You can pass the candy back and forth between your mouths. This is a risk, though--your partner may think it's gross or choke on the candy if he or she is not expecting it!

Buy a candy flavored lip gloss or chapstick.,
Apply the lip gloss to your lips.,
Kiss your partner!

",How to Give a Candy Flavored Kiss3," You can find these online or in dollar stores. From fruity flavors to root beer to your favorite brand of candy, there's a lip gloss out there that will fit your or your partner's tastes.

, Don't cake it on, as that can be sticky and gross. Do this right before you plan to make your move.


Try wearing a fragrance that is similar to the flavor of your lip gloss. If you are wearing strawberry lip gloss, look for a fruity body spray and apply just a hint. When you lean in for the kiss, your partner will have the smell in their nose and may experience the taste with more intensity.

It definitely helps when the man is confident, charming and has that “dying to kiss you” demeanor.,
All of the anticipation and anxiety over this one simple act is really kind of silly.,
Usually though, the question of when belongs to the man.,
If you’re totally into him then you can be proactive in welcoming in that first kiss.,
Above all else, remember to keep the atmosphere relaxed, calm and quiet.",How to Get a Man to Kiss You," However, many decent men out there may be struggling with feelings of doubt as to when he should make the big move.;
, There is no right or wrong time; it’s one of those “in-the-moment” experiences. The idea of having a perfectly organized when-and-where approach to kissing just defeats the whole purpose. It robs a couple of their enjoyment. A kiss should be magical and spontaneous, as unique as the two of you are.

, Most women have a natural fear about coming on too strong with a giant smooch of their own. So try to understand why most men feel nervous about their first kiss. Not every man is an expert when it comes to kissing. Men may be afraid themselves, of coming on too strong, seeming too aggressive or “forcing” the woman to kiss him. They want to create the perfect moment, the grand romance everyone dreams of.

, You can help him help him by displaying favorable body language. The more positive signals he gets, the more courage he will build. #Remember too that men are also stimulated by smells, not only perfume, but also natural body pheromones. Go easy on any superficial scents, and instead stick to shampoo and soap/lotion.

, Don’t talk if there’s the slightest chance he may kiss you. Just stare deep into his eyes until he gets the message. Now you can taste the magic of love.

Position your arms to draw your torsos together.,
Make head contact.,
Squeeze and hold.,
Use your hands.,
Let go slowly.",How to Hug Romantically1," In a romantic hug, your torsos—your chests and stomachs—will touch. This is a wonderfully warm and intimate position that emphasizes closeness.


Generally, the taller hugger puts their arms around the waist of the shorter person, while the shorter hugger puts their arms around the neck or shoulders of the taller person. The opposite can also happen, especially if there's a big height difference: the taller person places their arms around the other person's shoulders (and draws them into their chest), while the other person wraps their arms around the waist.





;
, Leaning your head on or against someone is a signal of intimacy. Move your head to the side as you lean in to give a romantic hug (in the US, most people will automatically move to their right.) Don't go too far to the side, though—you want your cheek to brush up against the other person's face. To add an extra romantic touch, nuzzle your head or even your face into the head/neck of the other person (or chest, if you're much shorter than the person you're hugging).

, A romantic hug lasts longer than a platonic hug. Gently clutch a little tighter for two or three seconds. Take a deep breath and exhale; relax into the hug and enjoy it. Note that your squeeze should be strong enough to be noticeable, but not so tight that it prevents him or her from breathing normally. Causing your hugging partner to pass out from lack of oxygen is not considered romantic in most circles.

, Rub one of your hands on their back or arm a few times. Or if your hand is by the person's head, gently stroke their hair, or the back of their neck. A slow caress is romantic. A brisk caress is comical, unless it's freezing outside and you're warming up your hugging partner.

, As you pull away, keep your hands on the other person so you're still touching each other after you hug. This is a good time to look into each others eyes, smile, and speak from the heart.

"

Come from behind.,
Stand behind the person you are going to hug.,
Place your arms in front.,
Make head contact.,
Squeeze and hold.,
Use your hands.,
Rotate your hugged one around.",How to Hug Romantically2," One way to enhance spontaneity is to surprise your love with a hug from behind. As long as they aren't doing anything too important, wrapping your arms around their waist, and resting your head against theirs can be a super sweet surprise.

, Press your torso up against the back person you are hugging, and wrap your arms around them. It doesn't matter so much if you are taller or shorter, other than where your hands will end up.


Generally, the taller hugger relaxes their upper arms, and reaches around to hug with their lower arms. The shorter hugger can hold their arms straight out, rather than bending at the elbow.







, You can ""stack"" one arm on top of the other, one arm in front of the other, or even reach up over the chest and hold the shoulders of the person you are hugging; it all depends on the size of your arms and the size of the hugged one where your arms are best placed.

, Like the front-facing hug, leaning your head on or against someone is a signal of intimacy. If you are as tall or taller than the hugged one, you can nuzzle their face or neck. If you are shorter, you can rest your head sideways on their back.

, A romantic hug lasts longer than a platonic hug. Gently clutch a little tighter for two or three seconds. Take a deep breath and exhale; relax into the hug and enjoy it.

, For the person being hugged, caressing your huggers arms is a natural, lovely touch. You can also reach back and caress their face or hair. For the hugger, though, caressing can become fairly intimate without much effort. If you're at that level with the person you are hugging, this is a delightful way to begin intimacies. If not, proceed with caution. It can result in the ice being broken, or your nose being broken. A slow caress is romantic.

, Enjoy a front-facing hug as you enjoy the closeness of your partner. Should you need further direction, start at the top of the page again. Enjoy!

See if you’re comfortable revealing your weaknesses to your loved one.,
See if you’re always finding new ways to compliment your significant other.,
If you're in love, then you will notice them for their inner beauty, not (only) their outer beauty.

",How to Know if You're in Love," If you’re really in love, then you shouldn't be able to picture your future without them. Whether at night, or in the morning, or with your friends, the fact that you can't stop means you're in love, and may have found ""the one"". Whether thinking of moving to a new city, having children, spending a year abroad, or reaching any of your future goals, you should be thinking of doing these things with your significant other by your side. If you can’t imagine going through life without your significant other — not just next summer, or next year ,or whenever— then you may be truly in love. Here are some other signs that you’re truly in love:


If you can't think about starting a new chapter of your life, whether it's a new job or a move to a new place, without your loved one at your side.
If you've thought about having children but can't imagine having kids with anyone other than your loved one.
If you can't imagine growing old without your loved one by your side.;
, To be in love, you don’t have to be obsessive about your loved one; in fact, quite the opposite is true. If you have a healthy loving relationship, then you should be able to spend time apart from your loved one without obsessing over what he or she is doing every five seconds. However, if you can go a whole weekend, or a whole month, without your loved one once crossing your mind, then you may like him a lot, but you may not necessarily have reached the love stage yet. Here are some other signs that you’re really in love:


If you read a book or see a movie without your loved one, you may wonder what he or she would think of it.
If you're trying on clothes without your special someone, you may think about how he would like your new look.
If you call or text your loved one just because you want to say hi or hear his or her voice, then you may be falling in love.

, If you’re really in love, then you won’t just be thinking of your loved one as a perfect object that should be worshipped, but as a living, breathing human being with an interesting perspective and many unique opinions. If you’re really in love, then you should value your loved one’s opinion and should care about what he or she thinks, whether it’s about your next career move or the political situation in your country. Though you don’t have to care what he or she thinks about absolutely everything, if you don’t truly value the input of your loved one, then you may not be in love yet. Here are some signs that you’ve truly found the one:


If you take your loved one's ideas into account when you're making a big decision, then you take your partner seriously enough to be in love.
If you're in a difficult social situation and value your special someone's opinion of what you should do, then you may be falling in love.
If you care what your loved one thinks about the news, politics, art, or anything else that truly matters to you, then you may be falling in love.

, If you’re really in love, then you shouldn't just be completely comfortable in your status quo, even if you’re very content with your loved one. Though being happy with the relationship you have and the person that you are is essential, being with your loved one should make you want to take your life to the next level and to be the best person you can possibly be—eventually. Here are some more signs that you’re truly in love:


If you want to read more, know more, care more, and just to be a more well-rounded person not just to please your loved one but because he or she really motivates you to want to change your life in a positive way, then you may be in love.
If you want to work on addressing your flaws and developing your character just from being around your loved one, then you may be falling in love.

, If you’re in love, then the person you love should bring out the best in you. After all, if you’re in love, then you should want to be with the person you’re with for the rest of your life, so that person should make you feel like your best self. If you feel like you can never fully be who you are, or that you’re inadequate in some way when you’re around your loved one, then you may not be in love. Here are some signs that you’ve fallen in love:


If you feel at your most handsome or beautiful when you're around your loved one, even if you're just rocking a casual look.
If you feel like you're at your smartest and sharpest when you're talking something through with your partner.
If you feel your most confident around your loved one, and never have to worry if you're going to sound stupid when you begin to say something.

, If you’re really in love, then you should be able to see your significant other as a real live human being with real human flaws – not as a god or a goddess. If you insist that your loved one is perfect, then you have a real problem. But if you’re comfortable admitting that your loved one can be a bit selfish or isn’t the world’s greatest listener, then you have a more realistic perspective on the relationship and are much more likely to be in love for real.


Being aware of your loved one's flaws doesn't mean you shouldn't help him or her address them if that's the right thing to do.
If you can't possibly think of two or three things that make your special someone less than perfect, then you may not be truly seeing the person for who he or she is.
If you and your loved one are comfortable enough with each other to laugh about one another's flaws, then you're more likely to be really in love.

, Love is about give and take. If you’re in love, then you should enjoy the giving just as much as the taking. You should take pleasure in making your loved one lunch, giving him or her a ride when s/he needs one, or even doing your loved one’s laundry if he or she is having a rough week. Though you shouldn't get taken advantage of, you should be able to enjoy helping your loved one when he needs it, and be prepared to be helped in return. Here are some more signs that you're really in love:


If you feel good about getting your loved one coffee or surprising him with a dessert from your favorite bakery without feeling like you're wasting your precious time.
If you enjoy teaching your loved one how to do something, whether it's to make the perfect burger or to solve a complicated math problem.

, Love doesn't have to be so serious all the time. Sure, you can spend hours staring longingly into the eyes of your loved one, but that can get a little boring. If you’re really in love, then you should be able to goof off and laugh with your loved one, and to enjoy the sense of humor of your loved one. Though neither of you have to be comedians for your relationship to work, it helps to be able to laugh with each other from time to time. This shows that you’re comfortable enough (and happy enough) with each other to be in love.


If your special someone has the ability to make you crack up even when you're in the worst of moods, then you may be falling in love.

, True love isn't like an episode of The Bachelor — though taking a helicopter ride with your loved one or having a romantic picnic in a vineyard can be intensely romantic and an incredible experience, real love means being able to find the fun in the mundane things with your loved one, from having a beer or two at your local bar to buying kitty litter and stopping to get ice cream on the way home. Here are some signs that you truly appreciate all of the time you spend with your loved one:


If you like just sitting around and watching your favorite TV show with your loved one.
If you like stepping out to get ice cream with your loved one as much as you like enjoying a delicious fancy four-course meal together.
If you enjoy a night in with your loved one as much as you like the occasional extravagant date.

, Love isn’t a bed of roses, though if you’re truly in love, the good days should far outnumber the bad, and you should be comfortable staying in your relationship during less-than-ideal circumstances, from a job loss to the death of a loved one. Tough situations can test the strength of your relationship, and if you’ve never had to overcome a significant hurdle with your loved one, then you may not have enough information to know if you’re in love yet.


If you were able to work through a tough problem in your relationship, whether it was trying to make it work with one of your insanely busy schedules or dealing with one person's disappointment in a major life event, then your relationship should be stronger for it.
If you were able to stay strong during the death of a loved one, then you're more likely to feel truly in love.

, If you’re really in love, then you should be willing to try something new and unexpected for your loved one, even if it makes you a little scared or queasy. This doesn’t mean that you should walk across hot coals or embarrass yourself just to win over the person you love, but it does mean that you should be ready to take a far-away trip to see your loved one’s distant relatives in Guatemala or go on a hike or two with your loved one if he’s obsessed with hiking.


If you're willing to do something that you thought you would never do, such as learn a new language or learn to swim, because it's really important for your loved one, then you're more likely to be in love.
If you've found yourself being more comfortable with being uncomfortable, with or without your loved one, then you may be in love.

, If you’re really in love, then you should know that you can’t always get your way. If your loved one is always giving in to your demands because you’re so stubborn, then you’re not really in love. Being in love means getting what you want sometimes, and letting your loved one get what s/he wants sometimes; or better yet, finding a solution that makes both people happy.


If you're in love, then you should not only be able to compromise with your loved one, but you should feel good about reaching a decision together, instead of feeling like you didn't really get what you wanted.
If you're really in love, then both people should be able to compromise, instead of one person doing all the giving in every time.

, If you’re really in love, then you shouldn't turn into a clone of your loved one, copying all of his or her interests and hobbies and shedding anything that gave you pleasure before you started your relationship. Instead, you should be able to maintain your sense of self while growing together with the person that you love. If you’re truly in love, then you should be doing the following things:


Being comfortable hanging out with your friends without your special someone, and letting him or her do the same.
Being okay with maintaining your own interests, such as yoga or soccer, even if your special someone doesn't do them.
Being happy having some alone time instead of always hanging out with your significant other.

, If you’re really in love, then you shouldn't hold back when you talk to your loved one. This doesn't mean that you should tell him or her every little thing that’s bothering you or nag him or her because you feel like you’re being honest, but it does mean that you should be comfortable enough in your relationship to be able to bring up something that’s bothering you, or sharing your true feelings, without feeling like it’s not worth it because your loved one will be bored, angry, or just won’t care.


If you can tell your boyfriend or girlfriend exactly how you feel about something without worrying that you sound immature or stupid, then you may be falling in love.
If you're okay with cracking a joke, no matter how corny it may be, then you and your loved one are on the same page.

, If you’re really in love, then you and your loved one don’t have to have deep discussions about the meaning of life or about the status of your relationship all the time. A lot of love lies in the little things, and most of your conversation won’t be earth-shattering or celestial, and that’s perfectly okay.


If you’re really in love, then you should be happy dissecting the latest episode of Breaking Bad with your loved one, or making small talk during a baseball game, and feeling that it’s enough.
If you've gotten off the phone with your loved one after laughing the whole time and wondering, ""What did we just talk about?"" then you may be in love.

, If you’re truly in love, then you should be comfortable enough to let your loved one to see the real you, even if that means showing your less-than-flattering side. If everything you say is devised to make your significant other like you or want to be with you even more, then you’re not comfortable with him enough to be really in love.


If you’re willing to open up and talk about your past mistakes or grievances, then you’re more likely to be in love.
You don't have to tell the person you love every last thing that has caused you pain, but you should be able to feel better after mentioning it. If you're in love, you'll accept each other, flaws and all.

, If you’re really in love, then when you feel the urge to compliment your partner, you should feel a fresh thought come to mind. If all you can think of is, “You’re so hot” or “You’re so funny,” then you have to dig deeper to find why you really love the person you’re with. You should be able to compliment the strong suits of the person you’re with — inside and out.


If you're always finding yourself pleasantly surprised by the seemingly endless good qualities that your loved one demonstrates, then you may be in love.
If you often tell your special someone things you love about him or her — and really mean it — then you may be in love.

If you look like you're already happy with yourself and your life, then the guy will want to be a very large part of it. If you seem desperate to find a guy to make you feel whole, you'll be much less likely to attract any man that comes your way.


Learn to love being yourself. Not meeting someone else's standards of beauty, or of how a woman should act.
Love whatever you do, whether it's talking to friends or being in class. A guy will be able to tell if you're content with living your life, and will want to join in.;
, Though you may feel like it's impossible to really love the way you look, it's easier than you think. Find three aspects of your looks that you truly adore and focus on emphasizing those when you get dressed. If you're unhappy with your figure, you can exercise to build muscle and burn fat; this will also make you feel more energetic and positive. Do whatever you have to do to truly love the way you look, and any man will be sure to follow.


You don't need to get a wardrobe makeover to feel good about how you look in your clothes — just wearing a few key items that you love can make you look and feel good no matter what happens.
You don't need to wear three or four layers of make-up, either. Just wear whatever makes you feel pretty while staying comfortable, but try to make it natural (if that's what you're looking for).
Keeping up good dental and bodily hygiene by showering daily, washing your hair as often as you need to, and brushing and flossing will also make you feel good about your fresh looks.
Don't try to look like everyone else. If you have gorgeous curly/frizzy hair or cute but small boobs, don't try to hide your unique features or emphasize what you don't have, just be true to yourself!
Don't keep checking your reflection in a mirror or window whenever you're out. This will make guys think that you're very insecure about your looks. So, save the scrutiny for the ladies' room.

, A guy will be much more likely to notice you if you just look like you're having a blast. Though it may be hard to look like you're ballin' if you're taking a math test or sitting in a waiting room at the dentist's, you should always stay positive. Smile whenever and wherever you can, and laugh often.


If a guy sees you out with girlfriends, you'll look much more appealing if you're laughing, giggling, and just looking like you're having an awesome time.
Don't spend all of your time looking around the room for someone better to talk to or checking your phone — if you look like you don't want to be there, a guy will take the hint, and leave you alone, if you obviously look like you don't want to talk.

, It's great to catch the guy's eye from time to time and to go back to laughing with your friends. It's not-so-great to stare at the guy, smile too eagerly, and step away from your friends as you wait for him to approach you. Don't apply your makeup in public, fidget with your outfit, or keep walking past the guy 100 times hoping he'll just walk over to you. This will certainly make him notice you — but not in the boyfriend type of way.


If he doesn't notice you right away, don't force it by awkwardly tapping him or winking at him. This will only push him away.

, Walking by the guy will help get his attention. Just walk by with a purpose, your head held high and your posture straight. Don't linger or walk like you don't know where you're going, but don't march right past him, either. Just walk slowly enough for him to notice you, to check out your cute outfit, and to see that he wants to know you better.


If you're walking towards a friend with big smile on your face, that will get your guy's attention even more.

, If you want the guy to notice you, then you should hold his gaze for just the right amount of time. Don't longingly stare into his eyes for hours — just keep eye contact for a few seconds to show him you're interested. Don't look too eager, but let him see that you'd be open to talking if he approached you. You can even give the guy a little smile to show that you want to see where this goes.


When he does approach you, give him a coy but distinct smile to let him know that you want to start talking to him.

, You only get one first impression, so you should make it count. Once the guy notices you and comes over to you, you should be friendly without coming on too strong, and approachable and just easy to be around. Put him at ease by making a small joke or poking fun at yourself, and avoid any negative or controversial topics to show him that you're fun to talk to.


Just smile and keep things light. You can talk about the deep stuff later.
Don't complain right off the bat. Guys want to hang out with girls who like to have a good time instead of nagging or being negative. If you're negative right away, that says something about what it would be to hang out with you all the time.

, Your body should say that you're confident and ready to talk to the guy. Keep your head raised and don't slouch or cross your arms over your chest. Avoid fidgeting with your jewelry or clothes or you'll look too nervous. Instead, lean in to hear the guy talk, and even give him a light touch on the arm or knee if things are going well.


Don't lose his attention. Keep looking into his eyes and avoid searching the room, making eye contact with your friends, or checking your phone every five minutes. This will make the guy think that you have better things to do than to talk to him.

, Once you're more comfortable, you can start flirting with the guy. Tease him a little bit, and let him tease you back — show that you're comfortable enough with yourself to let him poke fun at you. You can play with your hair a bit or even lick your lips to draw even more of his attention to you. Flirting is all about keeping things light and having fun — you don't have to tell him you think he's hot or start standing way too close to him to send him the message.


Talk a bit more softly than usual. This will make him lean in to hear what you have to say.

, Now that the guy has noticed you, you have to make sure that he wants to keep talking to you and appreciates the unique and amazing person that you really are. You should be yourself, but you should also work to maintain a positive vibe and to stick to topics that are uplifting, funny, and light. This is not the time to talk about your grandmother's funeral or how much you hate traffic — that can come later, when the guy knows you better.


If he complains about something, you can join in to bond with him. But as a rule, don't complain too much at the beginning.
Talk about the things that make you happy, like your hobbies, friends, or pets. He'll catch on to your enthusiasm.
Don't be overly disagreeable — even if you disagree. You don't have to hide your true feelings, but if it turns out you don't agree on something important, like your political beliefs, don't jump into an argument right away.
Ask him about the things he loves to keep things positive. Ask, ""What's your favorite thing to do on the weekends?"" instead of, ""What do you hate most about school?""

, You should not only be positive, flirty, and fun to talk to, but you should actually be interesting. Keep up a good conversation by showing off your sense of humor, being a little bit silly, or mentioning something interesting you read or saw in the news that could lead to a good conversation.


To engage the guy, ask him a few questions about himself to make him feel special. Ask about his interests or passions — just don't get too personal.
Just say yes. If he asks if you've ever seen a certain movie, don't just say ""No,"" but say, ""No, but I heard it was amazing. What was it about?"" Don't cut off any outlets of conversation just because you don't know much about the topic.
Be witty. Impress the guy with your ability to keep up a funny and sharp banter. Don't say ""that's funny"" if he makes you laugh, but answer back with an even funnier comment.

, It's great to get noticed, but guys can notice lots of girls. You should make him see what makes you so special by opening up a bit and talking about the things you care about — just not too much. Let him know what you love to do in your free time, how much you love your pets, or just mention a crazy experience you had, like climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro or studying abroad in Buenos Aires.


Whatever you talk about, let the guy see your passion for your life and your interests.
You should let him see that you're special, but don't just monopolize the conversation by talking about how great you are. Make sure that you're both contributing equally to the conversation.

, Finding common ground with the guy is a sure fire way to get him to keep talking to you. Whether you find that you love or hate the same sports team, spend your summers in the same place, or love the same band, this is something that can keep you talking for a long time and can open up other avenues of conversation.


If you've had your eye on the guy for a while, you might even know what his interests are. You can try to sneak them into the conversation to get the guy talking for longer.

, If it's going well, then you should go beyond getting the guy to notice you — get him to ask you out. The easiest way is to use your common interests as an excuse, such as mentioning that the band you both like is playing next week, or saying that a new sushi bar opened up in town if he mentions he loves sushi. You can also just give him a light complement and let him see that you like hanging out with him.


You can be less subtle, and even mention that you want to do something fun over the weekend but don't know what — just don't be too obvious about it.
Now that the guy has noticed you, it's up to you to keep his attention. If you're true to yourself and stay fun and positive, he'll be asking you out in no time at all.

, Find all of his social media pages and follow them — but not all at once!

Make sure to like and comment on his stuff. The heart eyes emoji will always work. Seeing you pop up in his news feed will make him start thinking about you...
Don't bombard him with messages and comments; that could be creepy!

, Then text him on holidays and the such."

Reflect on your own feelings about the lack of intimacy between the two of you.,
Consider your relationship as a whole.,
Have a medical check up.,
Ask for recommendations.,
Make decisions together.,
Evaluate the treatment after a few sessions.",How to Find a Sex Therapist," How is this affecting you personally? Is it something you see as temporary or are you concerned that it will be long-term? Is it yourself avoiding intimacy or is it your partner? Or does this seem to have grown in place through neglecting to talk about it? The answers to these questions will help you to reach a decision about how committed you are to seeking a resolution through a third party. For many people, restoring intimacy is a valuable motivator to seek help.;
, Do you generally get along well with your spouse or significant other and still have that warm, fuzzy feeling when he or she enters the room? Or have your feelings waned and instead of excitement you feel apathy or even annoyance? The reason for this deep level of honesty is to ascertain whether a sex therapist is the right choice or if you need a therapist able to go more deeply into general personal and relationship problems. For example, if you feel as if you’ve mentally checked out of the relationship, you might be better off considering therapy to remedy the whole relationship––not having sex may be one symptom of something more broadly wrong with your relationship that's brewing underneath; in this case, traditional relationship counseling can address both the mental and physical aspects of your relationship.

, In some cases depleted hormones or taking certain medications such as antidepressants and even birth control may play a significant role in why your interest has fallen flat. Visit your primary caregiver and request a full blood panel workup. Explain to the physician your concern so he or she can test your blood for certain hormone levels. Low testosterone may be the culprit, but it's also easy to fix.

, Obviously, asking for a name of a good sex therapist from the local soccer moms may not be a great way to make friends, but if you're cautious about whom you talk to, you could come away with a few reputable therapist names. Other sources of recommendations include:


Parents. While asking your mom if she knows a good sex therapist may not be comfortable, consider going to her if you have a more open relationship. If you guessed that mom and dad had trouble in their marriage or sought counseling, your parents could be a great source of wisdom and may have a good recommendation.






Close friends. Your very best friends, the ones who you know have your back, may be ideal folks to tap for a referral. Of course, the last thing you need is for a friend to talk about your inquiry behind your back, so choose carefully and skip any friend who you know won’t keep your request discreet.






Your doctor. Your OB/GYN or even family practitioner may have a colleague or someone they know or recommend who is a sex therapist. Even if they don't, it's likely they'll be willing to ask around for you.
Your psychologist. If you're already seeing a psychologist for other issues, ask him or her for a recommendation. You may also ask your psychologist for insights to help you determine why you're having issues in the boudoir.
Medical or psychological associations. Professional associations may be a good resource to retrieve bio and background information on the physician, which may help in your decision-making. Some reputable associations to try include American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists AASECT or the American Academy of Sexologists.
Insurance carrier. Your insurance carrier should have a list of physician and therapists based on specialty.

, While it may only be you who needs therapy (or both of you), the decision to seek counseling from a sex therapist should be made jointly. Make sure that your significant other is included in the selection process so that you both feel comfortable the decision. Even if one partner ends up going to the therapist more than the other, both parties will need to attend at some point in order to revive your connectedness and intimacy.


Maintain an open line of communication throughout the process. Although therapy days may be when you really spill your guts about how you feel, keep the lines of communication open throughout the week so your partner always knows how you feel. Talk about how you feel the therapy is working (or not working) and ask for your partner's feedback regularly.







, Do you feel closer as a couple and is therapy making a positive difference in the relationship? Take a step back and reflect before going forward. If you aren’t seeing a positive change, discuss this with your therapist. They can't read minds and may need to know what remains outstanding for you.


If it really doesn't work out with your first choice of therapist, don't give up. Consider seeking a new therapist, as the ""click"" between you is very important.

Think about how much time the two of you spend talking together.,
Check the hug and/or cuddle shrink.,
Consider how often the two of you set aside time just to be together doing something romantic rather than something practical.,
Consider whether you're giving one another enough space.,
Check for demands or interfering attitudes.,
Talk to your trusted friends about their perceptions.,
Be objective and stand back and analyze your relationship with realistic eyes.",How to Identify the Need to Rekindle a Romance," Did you used to discuss everything together but now find you're lucky to talk about who is dropping off the kids and who is responsible for the garbage run this week? If your partner hardly talks to you and you're hardly talking to your partner, you've become ships passing in the night and it's the clearest sign of all that you've let the love slip and are simply exchanging practical mundanities. Make a decision to set aside time for conversations and the deeper discussions that the two of you once had. If you don't, it'll be more than romance that's slipping by the by.;
, When you go to hug your partner or to have a wee cuddle, does your partner back away or shrug you off after just a few seconds and resume whatever they were doing? If yes, then you really need to have a chat. Don't just stand there in a strop and stop talking to them as a passive retaliatory measure, as this will only compound the problem and cause them to think you're moody.


Make allowances for the occasional bad day. Sometimes things happen when we don't want people crowding our space as we work through something. However, if the shrink is happening regularly, there is something amiss.

, You may be together when you're doing household chores, the grocery shopping, child raising and household maintenance but these are hardly romantic pursuits. They're the essentials of life but so is romance and unless you have been purposefully setting aside time to have the occasional candlelit dinner, evening out just for the two of you or going somewhere meaningful together once in a while, then you've let the romance slip. Routine can easily kill romance and spontaneity; reintroduce romance through planning it into your monthly schedule. It may not feel as spontaneous as when you first dated but once you're enjoying each planned romantic occasion, you'll realize it's worth the planning!

, Romance thrives on adventure, a little mystery and renewal. It's a little hard to feel any of these things when you're on top of one another all the time. Worse still is a sense of clinginess from one partner or even from both, an emotional state which can enmesh you in dependency on each other that results in a loss of the spark that ignited your original love for each other's individuality. As well as work, household chores, child raising and other essentials in life, find time to socialize with your friends as well as with one another. Spending time with your friends will give you different perspectives on life that will refresh and restore your sense of your relationship, allowing you to bring back stories, ideas, information and renewed excitement to your relationship. This works for both spouses, so be sure to encourage your spouse to take out time with friends too.

, When demands enter a relationship, romance suffers. If you feel that your spouse is always doing something that doesn't sit well with you (for example, ""always"" coming home late, ""always"" leaving the kids with you, ""always"" making you do X, Y, Z, etc.), then romance has fled. It is all too easy to end up in a row or giving one another the silent treatment if either of you feels taken advantage of, bossed around or not trusted. If this has started to happen, both of you need to re-examine your interactions and rephrase how you see ""always"" issues. Instead of accusing your spouse of ""always"" doing X, Y, Z, change the discussion to how something that is happening makes you feel. For example, replace ""you're always late home, I don't matter to you as much as that stinking job of yours"" with ""I am always looking forward to seeing you and I find it hard to wait for your return home"". This reminds your spouse of why you care and about the fact that you still excite one another. However, don't overdo this as it can be seen as manipulative or clingy if you take it too far or use it too often.

, Have they said anything about the two of you that has given you cause for pause? You most certainly don't need to air your dirty laundry with them but if they are saying that they've noticed small changes about the two of you, be alert and see if there is any truth in what they're saying and use this as indicators of where you might need to make changes. You don't have to believe everything they say but people outside of a relationship are often in a clearer position to remark on the more subjective elements of it with a less invested reason for seeing it other than what it is.

, Is the romance in your relationship teetering on a precipice or is it simply bubbling along unheeded underneath the drudgery of everyday living? Either way, you have a choice to bring it back, to reignite that spark. However, you also have a responsibility to be realistic about your relationship; as with most things in life, relationships mature and many romantic relationships turn into companionship over time, and are driven by a more enduring, reciprocal and less idealistic love that is capable of encompassing the boring patches of life and that accepts the imperfections of both love and of each other. Romance is idealistic and with that, it also causes us to idealize the one we love; when this type of idealization moves into acceptance, love endures and transcends the daily routine, the squabbles, the conflict and the troubles, ultimately enabling us to just accept what is and to love one another for who we are and for who we continue to become. Relax – finding pleasure in simply being together may not be the wow kind of romance you're after but it's a very solid, stable and loving approach to a long-term relationship.


Expect yourself, your spouse, your marriage and your ideas of romance to evolve with time. When seeking to rekindle romance, ask yourself very clearly exactly what it is about romance you want to invite back into your relationship. It may be very different now from five, ten or more years before.

Look for a guy who is incredibly wealthy.,
Seek someone well-educated.,
Consider only guys who are classically handsome.,
Find a guy who is tall.",How to Find a Modern Day Mr. Darcy1," The fictional Mr. Darcy is a wealthy landowner with a massive estate and lots of servants. A modern-day Mr. Darcy does not need to be a landowner, and doesn’t necessarily have to have a plethora of servants, but he should most definitely be rich. In Mr. Darcy’s case his wealth was inherited and passed down through his ancestors. A modern-day Mr. Darcy should come from a good family, but could have earned his wealth on his own., The fictional Mr. Darcy was raised properly by parents in the upper class. He was a first-born son, which means they had high expectations of him from the minute he was born. But at the same time, he was spoiled. He was taught that he was always right and didn’t need to answer to others. A modern-day Mr. Darcy should be someone who was raised in a good family who loved him, but maybe gave him a little too much freedom. He shouldn’t be spoiled-rotten, but he definitely had a pleasant upbringing., The fictional Mr. Darcy is handsome and sexy — to some. He’s not super-model beautiful, but he’s not ugly. He’s got a sophisticated, sexy look that some (but not all) women will find attractive. A modern-day Mr. Darcy cannot be someone with looks that always turns heads and gets noticed. He can’t be considered gorgeous and hot. He’s someone that you might not look twice at when you first meet him, but after time he grows on you.Look for someone who also has great hair and knows how to sport excellent sideburns!, The fictional Mr. Darcy is tall. The book mentions this by the way others talk about him and describe him. In fact, the book goes out of the way to make one of the least desirable men in the story be very short and stubby (Mr. Collins). A modern-day Mr. Darcy must be tall. His height is what gives him confidence and allows him to think he’s above some other people. It’s also something that might make him a little uncomfortable because it makes him stand out in a crowd, when he doesn’t want attention."

Do not look for Mr Right.,

Pinpoint a guy who treats family and close friends with the upmost respect and reverence.,
Track down a guy who is liked, and even envied, by others.,
Consider a guy who is shy in some cases.,
Watch for a guy who will do anything to set things right.,
Give him a chance if he knows how to love a woman.",How to Find a Modern Day Mr. Darcy2," The fictional Mr. Darcy is not a Mr. Right. In fact, we learn early on that Mr. Darcy is more likely a Mr. Wrong. He has a temper, he’s extremely judgemental (and prejudice, just like Lizzy), he’s rude, he’s conceited, he’s vain and he doesn’t always do the right thing at the right time. And there are times when Mr. Darcy may try to be a gentleman, but fails miserably due to his pride. A modern-day Mr. Darcy should not be a perfect man. He needs to have faults. He needs to make mistakes. He needs to learn from experience and use those mistakes to change his behaviour.Look for a guy who annoys and frustrates you every now and again.
Look for a guy with whom you’d fight with every so often.
Look for a guy who doesn’t meet every expectation or qualification on your list.
Look for a guy who challenges you and needs you to explain your opinion when it differs from his (which should be fairly often).

, If nothing else, the fictional Mr. Darcy is a perfect gentleman. He knows what it means to be a gentleman (in 19th century England) and works his hardest to live up to that standard — and he’s ashamed of himself when he doesn’t meet that standard. A modern-day Mr. Darcy should know what it means to be a gentleman in the modern era, and also work to live up to that standard — although many types of proper manners haven’t changed that much.Look for a man who always holds the door open for someone else, not just other women.
Look for a man who stands up when a woman is also standing up (e.g. arrives or leaves a dinner table).
Look for a man who doesn’t start eating before everyone else at the table has been served and has taken a bite.
Look for a man who doesn’t openly share every opinion he has unless specifically asked.
Look for a man who knows which fork to use in a complicated table setting.

, The fictional Mr. Darcy has a lot of pride. Mainly because that’s how he was raised to think and behave, so in some ways, he doesn’t know any better. He can be judgemental at times and condescending when he’s not thinking. But his pride doesn’t end up defining him. Instead he works to change his way of thinking and acting, and improves himself for the sake of love. A modern-day Mr. Darcy should be proud of who he is and where he came from, but he shouldn’t use his pride as a means for comparing himself to others.Look for a guy who is proud of his heritage and background, but doesn’t use that heritage or background to define who he has to be.
Look for a guy who is proud of his accomplishments and will admit that.

, In addition to being a perfect gentleman, the fictional Mr. Darcy holds a special place in his heart for his close friends (Mr. Bingley, devoted servants, tenants) and his family (specifically his sister, but not his aunt!). The modern Mr. Darcy must be someone who treats his beloved family members with the highest level of respect, but knows when a family member does not live up to his standards. He should also be someone who takes on familial responsibility when required.Look for a guy who always greets and thanks his doorman, secretary, and chauffeur.
Look for a man who can help you out without needing to take you over.
Look for a man who supports you but doesn’t expect you to do what he wants to says all the time.
Look for a man who knows you are independent and that you love your independence.

, The fictional Mr. Darcy is liked and envied by a lot of the people around him, for different reasons. Some people are jealous of his wealth. Others wish they had his property and inheritance. The important thing, however, is that Mr. Darcy does not go looking for this attention. In fact, he hates it. A modern-day Mr. Darcy should be the same way. He should be someone who is admired and liked by those around him, but from a distance. He should also be uncomfortable with that admiration and wish it would go away. He should also be someone who others envy and wish they could be.Look for a guy who is talked about by others in the nicest possible way. A guy who everyone has something good to say about, even if the people talking about him might actually be a little jealous.
Look for a guy who is ‘in demand.’ Someone who is always invited to parties and dinner, sent Christmas cards every year, remembered on his birthday, etc.
However, at the same time, he should be a guy who isn’t necessarily thrilled with this attention. He should be a guy who would prefer not to really be noticed if possible.

, The fictional Mr. Darcy is shy. He may not admit this, but it is true. He’s not very outgoing. He doesn’t initiate conversations with strangers. He isn’t at ease at a party like his friends are. A modern-day Mr. Darcy should not be perfect in every social situation. There should be situations that make him uncomfortable and stand in the corner. He shouldn’t be the life of the party, and he shouldn’t be the one always getting the laughs.Look for a guy who is shy and awkward at a party or in a public place, but who is open, friendly and chatty when he’s at home or with only his close friends.
Look for a guy who would prefer to stay home and be comfortable than go out on the town and participate in the nightlife.

, The fictional Mr. Darcy messes up massively. Not only does his pride get in the way of his ability to socialize with certain people, but he completely and totally bombs his first attempt at a proposal to Lizzy. However, Mr. Darcy learns that he’s made these mistakes and realizes that his actions were not appropriate — and he makes up for it. A modern-day Mr. Darcy makes mistakes, but sets them right. He admits when he’s wrong and makes up for any wrongdoing.Look for a guy who is only a little stubborn, but not set in his ways.
Look for a guy who knows how to apologize and make amends.

, The fictional Mr. Darcy knows that he loves Lizzy, he just has a really hard time understanding it and explaining it to her. He has such a hard time that he screws up at first. But he realizes quickly that he’d do anything for Lizzy, and for love. A modern-day Mr. Darcy needs to understand that love trumps all and can overcome differences in opinion. He has to be willing to work to make the love work. And he needs to be willing to go out of his way to prove his love (for you)."

Have life goals in mind.,
Avoid relationship cycling.,
Pay attention to feelings of calm and comfort.",How to Find Your Soulmate," It may seem counterintuitive, but it is important that you are happy and confident as a single person before you are ready to find your soulmate. Relationships will last longer if both partners are healthy, stable, and confident in themselves. If you want to find your soulmate--and if you want your ideal partner to be equally attracted to you--you have to know who you are, what you want, and like yourself.Some ways for you to enjoy spending time with yourself include:


Finding interesting hobbies to pursue
Valuing your friendships and family
Pursuing an interesting, stable career
Practicing being confident and strong

Keeping a diary to help keep you focused and to remind you of how far you've come;
, Make a list of traits you enjoy in a partner. Perhaps you are attracted to a good sense of humor or to a nice smile. Maybe you like someone who is athletic and participates in sports, or maybe you are attracted to someone who enjoys reading novels. No matter what the trait is, consider how you might be able to embody that trait yourself. If you work on yourself in this way, you might find that you end up meeting somebody who shares your interests and desires. Moreover, if you do not end up meeting your soulmate in this way, you will still have improved yourself and learned new skills., Studies show that people are not always able to predict the traits to which they are most attracted. If you make a list of desirable traits, it is quite likely that you will be attracted to a person in real life who exhibits quite different traits.It is fine to have a few relationship dealbreakers as you attempt to find your ideal partner: however, let your instincts guide you more than a list of pros and cons. You might be surprised by the wonderful person you meet.


It is especially important to avoid certain internal biases and prejudices. Do not judge a person based on his/her skin color, religion, ethnicity, or age. Take some time to get to know the person before you decide whether or not a relationship is worth pursuing., If you meet a wonderful person who is in a relationship with somebody else, resist the urge to have an affair with him or her. Most relationships that began with an act of infidelity do not last. They are rooted in scarcity and in wanting what you cannot have more than in true affection.Wait until your ideal partner is single for a while before pursuing him or her in order to make sure that your relationship has a fighting chance., The more interesting friends you have, the more interesting strangers you will meet through them. Expand your social network to expand your dating pool. Pursue friendships and close acquaintanceships if you want to meet new, promising people to date.Some great ways to meet likeminded people include:


Joining a meetup group
Participating in a hobby
Volunteering for a cause you care about
Joining an alumni organization
Cultivating the friendships and acquaintanceships you have: invite friends out to dinner, host a few parties, or schedule a happy hour

, Smiling and laughing will help make new acquaintances feel more comfortable around you. If you want to encourage somebody to open up, keep your body language open and act in a friendly manner. Some light flirting with someone you're attracted to is also a great way to determine if they are attracted to you as well., Your friends know who you are and what you like. Let their instincts guide you if they think you might be a good match for someone they know.Not all blind dates are successful, but some certainly are. Don't close yourself off to opportunities to meet new, interesting people.

, There are numerous styles of flirting. However, in general, the most successful flirters tend to be respectful, complimentary, expressive, and use friendly body language. People who use closed-off body language, teasing, or self-deprecation in flirting tend not to be as successful.Pay attention to the following traits if you want to flirt or be able to recognize flirting in others:Smiling and laughing
Affirming through nods or verbal agreements
Continuing the conversation
Using open body language (open arms, legs, and palms)
Sharing personal details
Making eye contact
Asking questions

, Many people find their soulmates through online dating. However, it can be a tough world to navigate. Users report having more success when they keep their dating profiles honest but brief. Let there be a bit of mystery when other users read your profile: don't show your hand right away. Use dates to get to know each other: don't let the profile do all the work for you., People are more likely to feel attracted to someone else when they are in a situation of arousal. Having a fast heartbeat, sweating, and experiencing extreme feelings can make someone more susceptible to feelings of sexual attraction and liking.Some good, physically arousing places where you might find a potential soulmate include:


The gym
High places
Horror films

, If there were only one person meant to fall in love with one other person, then only 1 out of every 10,000 people would find true love during their lifetimes.We all know that this isn't true: people fall in love and have beautiful relationships all the time. Do not become obsessed with finding the single best person for you: instead, make it your goal to develop close, sustaining, healthy, and loving relationships. See if your soulmate might blossom in front of you instead of depending upon random chance to give you the one perfect person. Many of the most satisfying kinds of love happen over a long period of time, which indicates that soulmates become so over many years of getting to know one another., Soulmate often implies that two people were made for one another and can exist in perfect harmony. However, all strong, close, lasting relationships will involve conflicts and disagreements. Studies show that couples tend to be more satisfied with their partners when they think of their love as a journey or pathway. Try to frame your own search for a soulmate in these terms: you're not looking for a perfect, harmonious match. Instead, you're looking for a partner to walk the journey of life with, including the positives and negatives.Another way to phrase this is that you should be looking for somebody to grow with, not just somebody who was destined to meet you.Framing your love as destiny instead of as a journey is especially harmful during conflicts or arguments. During happy periods, there is not as much of a distinction., Studies show that instinctive reactions to another person are important predictors of overall relationship success.Don't try to talk yourself out of your initial instincts about a person. If you have a good feeling about him or her, pursue the relationship. If you feel uncomfortable or anxious about the relationship--even if everything looks good on paper--you might want to consider finding somebody else.

, Perfection in a lover often doesn't happen right away: it takes time. If someone seems like a good fit but has some slight imperfections, try to look at the bigger picture. A perfect love can happen between two imperfect people.This advice does not apply to ""imperfections"" that are in fact abusive or controlling. If your partner tries to hurt, insult, or isolate you from others, that is a relationship dealbreaker.

, When you find a potential partner, concentrate on building a strong friendship with him or her. Do fun activities together, talk to one another about your life goals, learn about each other's interests, and support one another. Couples who value each other's friendship are more successful, romantic, and loving over the long term.Those who form friendship bonds will find that they are also more romantic with one another (even the sex is better!)., Even if you meet somebody who seems ideal to you, you both will have to work hard in order to strengthen and grow your relationship so that it lasts. This means that you might have to solve disagreements, put up with one another's annoying habits, and be forgiving of one another.Some of the most important steps to take in order to remain with your soulmate include:



Listening actively to your soulmate
Forgiving your soulmate for minor mistakes
Supporting your soulmate's hobbies and interests
Refraining from entering into relationships with other people (if you choose to be in a monogamous relationship)
Expressing gratitude to your soulmate

, Going on a double-date with another couple can help keep your own relationship passionate and loving. This effect is especially strong when you and your partner talk about intimate topics with the other couple.Invite two close friends out to dinner or join a meet-up group designed for couples to get acquainted with one another. Let your social network help you and your partner become true soulmates.

, Relationships are happier and more fulfilling when couples take the time to be physically affectionate with one another after sex.If you think you have found your soulmate, be sure that you make time to cuddle, spoon, and have some pillow-talk after sex. This will create a positive feedback loop that will allow your relationship to thrive.

, It is true that two soulmates can help shape one another's lives and goals. However, it is also important for you to remain true to yourself in life and love. Consider what you desire most in life and whether your potential soulmate can help you achieve these goals. There are some cases when affection is not enough to sustain a relationship or a life: you have to value and share one another's dreams too.Some questions to keep in mind include:


How important is my career, and can my partner foster that career?
Do I want to have children some day? Does my partner?
Where do I see myself in 5 years? 10? 20? Can I envision my partner alongside me?
Are my partner and I happy living in the same kinds of cities/towns/regions? If your partner is miserable in the city but you can only live in a bustling metropolis, you might want to rethink things.

, Relationship cycling refers to an ongoing break-up/make-up cycle between partners. These relationships can be very enticing since they are rooted in a combination of familiarity and excitement. However, this excitement--while thrilling--is usually of the negative sort. And studies show that couples who get into a break-up/make-up cycle often have poor results over the long term.Remember that relationship cycling not only wastes valuable time and emotional energy, but it might prevent you from meeting somebody who is a much better fit for you.

, If you have found a soulmate, you will feel peaceful, joyful, and will believe that your relationship is a strong and healthy one.Your soulmate should support you, and you should support your soulmate. If you feel anxious, nervous, or queasy because of your relationship, you might not be in the right relationship for you. Remember that calmness, comfort, and relationship health are more important than drama, nerves, or adrenaline rushes.

People with self-confidence tend to have happier and longer lasting relationships than those who don't. It might seem hard to suddenly start loving yourself, but it's an important component of a strong relationship.


""Fake it 'til you make it"" is a phrase often thrown around when talking about building self-confidence and esteem, but it's a technique that really works! Stand upright with your back straight and take up space. Even simply standing in a power position can build your confidence. Fake confidence a little every day, as practice, and you'll find it becoming easier and easier.Be kind to yourself. The things you think and say about yourself are probably a whole lot meaner (and untrue) than things you'd say about your worst enemy. Every single person is imperfect, so be kind to yourself about your own imperfections. When you find yourself thinking negatively about yourself, replace the thought with a positive one.For example: if you start thinking ""My nose is too big,"" change that thought to ""My nose has served me really well over the years and makes it so I can smell and taste all the great things.""
Don't compare yourself to other people.There is always going to be someone who is more attractive, more successful, or smarter than you. Focus instead on celebrating your accomplishments and honoring the accomplishments of others, without comparing yourself to them.;
, There's no right answer for why you want to fall in love, but there are some reasons that indicate you need to work on yourself before you're ready to fall in love. There's nothing wrong with wanting to have a loving relationship, but basing your self worth on the success of such a relationship will place too much pressure on the other person and the relationship itself.


A few reasons to wait before getting involved in a relationship are:you are feeling lonely or think you need your self-esteem bolstered by someone else, all your friends are in relationships, or you believe you need to have a relationship to be happy. These are all symptoms of deeper problems that won't be cured by entering into a relationship.

, No, don't make a list of exact specifications detailing the hair color, job, schooling level, and personality of your potential significant other. It is not helpful to create an ""ideal"" partner that doesn't exist in reality. However, you should acknowledge the basics of what you're looking for.


For example: in terms of personality, perhaps you're looking for someone who has a good sense of humor and can laugh at themselves, or you're looking for someone who is kind and cares about people.
You should also list what you absolutely don't want. For example: perhaps there's a certain political affiliation that doesn't work for you; or you don't want someone who has to travel a lot for his or her job, so he or she is rarely around.
You can always revise this list, as you meet different people, but it's a good idea to know the kind of values and traits you're looking for from a potential partner. It'll make it easier to weed out the people with whom you can't build a lasting romantic relationship.

, Of course, to be able to find someone with whom to fall in love, you're going to need to go out and meet people. This doesn't mean you have to be a big party animal, or that you have to do things that you're not entirely comfortable with, but it's a good idea to at least try to get out of your comfort zone a little bit.Do things that you enjoy and meet people that way. For example: if you're into reading and writing, join a book club or writing group. If you're really into rock climbing, go to a climbing gym in your neighborhood.
Be out and about. Go to a coffee shop or bookstore (or museum/library, etc) and hang out there as a weekly excursion. Who knows who you'll meet?

, Doing things that you might not normally do can help create a sense of excitement for you, as well as take you outside your comfort zone to meet different kinds of people.


Doing something exhilarating, like participating in a political demonstration, performance art, or something like sky-diving can help foster relationships, perhaps because you begin to associate the excitement of the event with the group of people. So get out there and do something exciting with a group of people and see what love blossoms.
You don't have to do something dangerous. You could do something as simple as take a free class on cooking or car maintenance. Not only will you be out of your comfort zone, you'll learn a new skill, so even if you don't find that special someone you'll be getting something important out of the activity.

, Be patient. It can take years to find the right person. Along the way, you may find people that you think are right for you, but turn out not to be. Use these opportunities as learning experiences. Eventually, you'll get a sense for the kind of person you're looking for.


Be friendly and open to people you meet. Even if you don't fall in love the first time you meet someone, you may eventually find yourself developing an attraction to him. This can happen even with people you wouldn't normally have been that interested in at first. It can be a sign that a person has depth and substance.
Remember, opposites may attract. Let things unfold for a little while when you meet someone new. Long-lasting relationships can be forged from two personalities that initially clash.

, In short, you'll need to ask her out and see if the interest is returned. It might be a little nerve-wracking, since you're opening yourself up, but finding love means taking emotional risks.


Be honest. Simply tell her that you really like her and would like to see where the relationship goes. All you have to say is ""Hey, I really like you and I'd like to with you.""
If she says no, that's okay! It's not a reflection on you and whether you're lovable. Don't press her or be pushy, because that will only irritate her and make her feel as if you don't respect her and her boundaries.

, Falling in love means opening yourself up to the other person emotionally. It's about taking a risk and being open and vulnerable with another person.It can be scary to lay yourself open like that, but it's the only way to deepen a relationship.


It's important to remember that people move at different speeds in terms of relationships, so the other person may take less or more time to open up emotionally. As long as you communicate about where you both are in the relationship this shouldn't pose a problem.
If the other person doesn't reciprocate your openness or interest in having a connected, open relationship, then it's time to move on and find someone who is more committed to the same type of relationship as you.

, Intimate compatibility is incredibly important to ensuring a loving connection (and this doesn't just mean sex). Look at the person you're with and see how you connect.Emotional compatibility means expressing tender and loving feelings towards one another in a constructive and fulfilling manner. This means effectively expressing things like, ""I'm sorry,"" asking (and caring) how you're doing, and expressing what you mean to one another.
Physical compatibility means expressions of affection and intimacy (again, this does not necessarily mean sex, although that can be an important component in some people's relationships). Things like hugging, cuddling, holding hands, kissing are expressions of physical intimacy.
Intellectual compatibility means that you feel on equal footing with the other person and that the two of you engage in mutual discussions that are fulfilling to you both, even if you don't necessarily have the same things in common.

, Trying to force yourself or another person to fall in love won't work and will simply make you or him resent the relationship eventually. Falling in love is, in a sense, letting go of control. Be open what the other person is feeling about the relationship, as well as what you want from it.


Let go of the need to control the outcome of the relationship. You can't know where the relationship is going to go and whether it will end in love, or if it will simply end. Be open to the possibilities and let it go where it will go.

, Without trust, the relationship becomes a ticking time bomb and not something you want to be a part of.


Check that your partner is reliable and dependable. Does she do what she says she is going to do, when she says she is going to do it? Do you? Building trust and being reliable goes both ways.
Your partner should be someone that you can count on. If you can't count on her, or she doesn't keep their promises (she lies, she cheats, she's flaky, etc.), she probably isn't someone with whom you want to have a lasting connection. You shouldn't go into a relationship looking to change someone or make her ""better.""

, You aren't going to agree with your significant other all the time, but dealing with your argument in a healthy manner will mean that the relationship is more likely to last.


Things not to do: hold grudges (you need to talk your problems out before they spiral into a long-time grudge), freezing emotionally and shutting down (this won't help you work out your issues), running away from arguments and issues (this will make those issues build and build until they explode).
Things to do: solve the issue and then let it go, deal with the problem itself instead of attacking the other person (asking your partner to help out around the house, instead of calling him lazy), use humor to dissolve the tension (obviously there's a right time for everything and humor isn't always appropriate, but often it can be a good way to calm both of you down to tackle the problem more constructively).
Never threaten to break up as a knee-jerk response to a fight. If your partner threatens you this way, wait until a calmer moment to remind him that this damages the trust you share.

, There's no tried and true way to know you're in love. People often say you'll just ""know"" if you're in love, but there are some things that indicate you're heading in that direction, if not already there.


You can spend quiet time together. This means that you both don't feel the need to fill the silence, and that you're comfortable with one another so that silence doesn't end up feeling awkward. You can enjoy the presence of one another without the need to constantly interact.
You find her quirks cute, not annoying. If you find it adorable when your partner snorts while laughing, or always has to sleep on the side of the bed closest to the wall, you're probably falling in love with her.
Another sign is that you're excited to introduce your partner to your family and friends. It shows that she is important to you.
You're comfortable being yourself with her. This is a big one, because it means that you feel that you're the best version of yourself with her and that you don't feel like you're inadequate (even if you don't look perfect and attractive 100% of the time).

, Talk about your feelings with him and see what he is feeling. Communication is key to maintaining a relationship.


Don't just assume your lover knows you love him — say it. It can be important to cementing that feeling for both of you. It can settle nerves and calm any lingering fears. Most importantly, it gives both of you the certainty that comes with clearly stating your feelings.

, Keeping the relationship fresh is a great way to keep you both interested and invested in making it work.


Have a date night. You both can get busy with work and worries (even kids) and forget to take time for yourselves. Suddenly the two of you are more like roommates who never see each another than people in a romantic relationship. Your date can be simple as snuggling on the couch with a movie and popcorn, or it can be going somewhere like a restaurant or nightclub.
Try new things. Don't just go to the same restaurant every date night. Try out things you both might enjoy like going skydiving, laser tag, or taking a cooking class together. Laughing at your mistakes and figuring out new skills can help bring you together and spice things up by taking you out of your comfort zone.
Do little favors for your partner like mending his favorite shirt. Do things so that he won't have to, like washing the dishes after he has made dinner. A smile when you come in from a long day at work, a sweet hug and kiss hello, a quick ""I love you,"" when you are leaving — all these things let him know that you're thinking of him.

, Feeling gratitude for the other person and telling her that you are grateful for her presence will strengthen and deepen your relationship.


You can even do it in small ways. Thank her for cooking you a meal (even if it's a simple one), or being the one you can talk to.
Do an appreciative gesture. If there's something she's had her eye on (flowers, a book, a new teapot), you can buy it and tell her that you love and appreciate all the times she's been there for you. Remember that you don't need to buy something for it to be special; you can pick wildflowers for her or write her a thoughtful card.

Pursue your interests and regain your passion about them.,
Stay open to all possibilities.,

Understand that at your probable age, the antenna is usually tuned to a finer frequency.,
Pursue a setting that will maximize your confidence.,
Gauge the timing of becoming more intimate with another person according to your own needs and self-recognition of readiness.",How to Feel Confident About Being Intimate Again," You may have to change a habit of what may have ""suddenly"" become years. Virtually any step in a new direction will give you confidence.;
, It's common, when intimacy is lost, to withdraw from familiarity with others, as well. A big step to regaining confidence is intimacy, and in general, will be re-engaging with others on a familiar level.


You could join a club or group, work a piece of choice athletic equipment up a popular trail, or volunteering. Whatever you choose, make sure it's something you enjoy participating in, and that is fulfilling for you. Allow a couple weeks of doing something new before you make any judgements, as you may find yourself out of your comfort zone.







, In the course of being vital, it wouldn't hurt you to turn up the antenna a little bit. If you're doing something you love, you'll be glowing, and you'll tend to radiate more attractiveness as a result. This will be picked up by others around you, and they'll be inspired.


If you already have a ""beau"", all of this will just make you more attractive to them.







, In other words, take full advantage of losing 8 pounds, and being noticed for it; or pursue some other, equally modest but worthwhile achievement. Looked at a certain way, a step in any direction is a step you hadn't taken. Tiny little steps will get you up a mountain. Recognizing and celebrating the achievements of your life as you're bumping into Mr. or Ms. Right is possibly your best visualization technique right now.

, At your age you are much more likely to be attracted to the different aspects of people; and this means that you may be most attracted to people that feel the same way. In turn, recognizing that your intimacy will encompass more than mere lust or self-satisfaction can help you to feel greater confidence about sharing more time and more of yourself with someone else.

, For most people, this would mean being intimate in an environment that you feel safe and comfortable within. Whether your intimacy consists of getting to know another person through conversation, through physical exploration, through spending time together achieving something, or through spiritual connection, the place where you become more intimate matters. For some, this place of comfort will likely be your own house; however, personal considerations might dictate that you do the opposite, and find somewhere that isn't so deeply connected with your past for starters.

, You are old enough to know when you want to proceed now; and obviously, you may have some resistance to overcome, after years with one dedicated mate, and then perhaps years without someone in your life. Just be open in communicating this, and if you have chosen right, it will be understood.


See that the ""first time"" now will likely be tougher than the ""first time"" was when you were much younger; you just have a wall to break down.






While a little alcohol might relax your inhibitions in being more intimate with a person, if you aren't comfortable, yet, with your prospective beau, you won't be confident -- and that probably means it's just not quite time yet.

Usually, this is because we have a hard time believing that someone else could love us because we can't love ourselves. If you feel unloved by others, the best place to start is to learn to love yourself first. Build your opinion of yourself by celebrating your positives and embracing your negatives. Stop holding yourself to an ideal of perfection and realize that you are fine just the way you are.;
, Self confidence is an extremely attractive quality in a person. When people see that you think you can take on the world and win, they begin to believe it too (and they love it!). Build your self confidence by taking on challenges in your life, speaking up for yourself, and doing things that make you proud of who you are.

, Sometimes, our brains get sick. They don't work quite right and they need a little help feeling better again. If you think that maybe your problems are too big for you to handle, please get help. Like taking medicine for a cold, it's important to take care of your body by getting the professional help of a doctor. We here at wikiHow love each and every one of you and we want you to be happy. You do what you have to do to make that happen!

, Make sure you know what love really looks like. Sometimes, really horrible people in our lives will convince us that love looks different than it actually does. Don't let them get you confused: love should never hurt, love shouldn't feel one-sided, and love shouldn't feel conditional.

, Look at how the person or people that you love act. Do they say mean things to you? Do they physically hurt you? Do they blow you off when you really need them? Do they ignore you when you tell them how you feel? These are bad signs. If, however, they maybe don't say it but they do show it by being there for you, trying to avid hurting you, and never giving you reason to think they think less of you, they probably love you but are just bad at showing it.

, Are you carrying all the weight in a friendship or relationship? Do you do way more for them than they do for you? Do you shower them in kindness and you're just met with empty thank yous and no reciprocation? These are bad signs. If, however, you feel like you get out as much as you put in, things are probably okay.

, If someone hurts you (physically or emotionally), or even if they're just more work than they're worth, don't keep them in your life. You don't need that. Leave them behind and get back out there. Find the friends and relationships that are fulfilling for you because you deserve it!

, This is hard, but this is the best way to stop the feeling of being unloved. Tell the people in your life that you love how you feel. Tell them that you're having problems. And when they say that they love you, take them at their word. Give them the opportunity to show it. Stop shutting them down or second-guessing their feelings. They probably do really love you.

, You might not feel loved if you have a very specific idea of what love looks like or where it comes from. Take a look at how you define love and think about maybe redefining it. Love doesn't have to come from a romantic relationship, and it doesn't have to include expensive gifts, cards on birthdays, or meeting some list of required qualities.

, A great way to help yourself feel loved is to give back to your community. Volunteering in your local area, anywhere from hospices to soup kitchens, can help you and your community a lot. People will appreciate all you do to help them and you'll find the love you're looking for while making an incredibly positive impact.


There are also organizations like Big Brothers, Big Sisters, if you want to help a child who also needs to feel loved.

, A dog or cat is a great way to feel loved. Our pets love us and rely on us a lot. You can have a wonderful impact on an animal by taking in a rescue animal or even volunteering at a foster home. Especially if your area is low on no-kill shelters, this can be a really wonderful thing to do.

, Finding a community of people that are just like you can be a wonderful way to feel loved. The internet has made that much easier than it used to be. Fan communities are an easy way to start making friends online. You can also make some new friends in real life too. Try taking a class in a subject that interests you from your local community center.

, Another option to help yourself feel loved is to join or get more involved in a church or other local religious group. Find one that shares your values and start attending regularly. You can even join a study group to help develop even closer relationships with your fellow parishioners.

, If you really think a romantic relationship is what's best for you, you can try dating someone new if you're ready (emotionally) to be with another person. Just remember: you should never enter a relationship expecting that the other person will make all of your problems go away or think that you can't be happy unless you're in a relationship. These are not healthy ideas. If, however, you're ready for the hurdles of being with someone else, you can get a boyfriend or get a girlfriend.

Are you confident, shy, bold, careful, smart, getting smarter, involved, inactive, sensitive, tough, etc.? Deciding on what type of temperaments you are hoping for in a partner is much easier by being clearer about your own character, first. Someone who handles emotions and conflict nearly like you do is likely to be a better match than someone who responds very differently. This step can be somewhat of a journey into self discovery as a key element in loving anybody else is the ability to love yourself too. Write down a list of your traits and attributes as you perceive them. Don't rush it, you can come back to the list over several days if needed.


Lists of personality traits, personal attributes, etc. can be found in psychology texts and many career choice books. Reading through such lists will help to jog your mind––see which traits you strongly identify with. Do be careful to avoid choosing traits you ""wish"" you had, as clearly, those are not who you are for real.;
, Once you have identified the traits, you'll have a good guide as to what kind of person is appropriate for you. At its most basic, for example, if you are:


Talkative, then you may go well with a reserved person who likes to listen more than talking.
An introvert, you can be very attracted and very suited to a certain kind of extrovert and vice versa.
Career driven, then you may love a homebody who wants to be an organizer, cook, ""homemaker"", and you will bring home the bread.
Artist or musician, then you may love a person who appreciates and supports talented, whimsical, different kinds of ""ambitions"" and may become your biggest fan.

, The Keirsey Personality (Temperament) Sorter (""The Keirsey Temperament Sorter®-II (KTS®-II)"") is a popular online test that you can take (it's free). According to this test, you'll be able to tell what temperament is your better match (such as the opposite of your personality type). The Keirsey model sorts people into four basic temperament groups, namely Artisans™, Guardians™, Rationals™ and Idealists™. There are further subdivisions that allow you to discern character types, four types in each.In the personality types there are 16 sets of 4-letter labels (take care not to mix up their order). Each of the 16 possible ordered combinations has an opposite (call it a complement or supplement) out of the other 15, and then the other 14 character types differ only slightly.

Let's compare two of the complete opposites, such as, for example two opposites: ""ENFJ"" complements/or supplements ""ISTP"" in all four positions, all based on:
(1st) E - Extrovert complements I - Introvert;
(2nd) N - iNtuitive complements S - Sensing;
(3rd) F - Feeling complements T - Thinking;
(4th) J - Judging complements P - Perceiving.



Each opposite trait may complete, complement/supplement, or supply similar things or differing ones. To what extent the traits do this will depend on the other 3 trait types and their 16 various combinations. You can be the same or just somewhat opposite or diametrically different in 1, 2, 3 or all 4 trait categories. But, you may even be almost equal in the intensity of all 4 traits, differing trait by trait, by only a point or two, or very strongly differing by as many points as possible. Or, you might be evenly balanced, as much introverted as you are extroverted, i.e.: capable of balance, well rounded, or on the worse side, vacillating, moody, or lacking in decisiveness. Whether you're equal, differing or evenly balanced all depends on the expression and intensity of each of the other three traits.
There are 8 differing types of extroverts and 8 types of introverts. Learn more about the meaning of each by taking the sorter/test, then reading your possible temperament shadings, differing character types, your fit to various career types, dating and marriage partner types, etc. You might like to get a book that explains it. The Keirsey books are: Please Understand Me II (2nd edition). Note that the first edition Please Understand Me was somewhat different in how the traits and temperaments were distinguished and portrayed, so if you grab a secondhand copy, it won't be as up-to-date or reflective of more recent knowledge.
The Keirsey model isn't the only test you can take. There are other types available too; for example, see two more similar self-tests in the Tips section.

, Real differences can supplement or complement one another greatly; try to avoid assuming you must ""click"" perfectly on everything. Think about things you enjoy doing (possibly begin a quick list). What makes you happy, especially during your real time when not under the pressure of formality (such as at work or in class)? The things that motivate you and bring you happiness naturally are a natural expression and should help to guide you in finding a person with similar motivations.


Also note what you dislike, or even hate. This will help you to steer clear of such possibilities, and let you sidestep a person who has many unwanted traits.

, You'll be attracted to opposites naturally, whether it's a weak, medium or strong attraction. But deciding upon the kind of opposite that suits you best requires keen observation and careful choosing.


Opposites may have many interests in common, or not so much, or maybe even none! You may, for instance, prefer to travel while the other prefers to stay at home. This doesn't mean that this person is a poor match; it may indeed work well.
Some traits can be generational- or age-related. For example, differences in entertainment likes/dislikes can be influenced by your era and the era of the other person. The experiences of each of you makes for great similarities or differences. It's helpful to remain aware of this, especially if there is a large age gap.

, Think of reasons why you are looking for a partner, including whether this is the right time for you to be making an intimate connection in your life. Be aware that during your search, other influences can at times override your own wants, such as parents or siblings being pushy, friends seeking to match-make or societal pressures about ""doing the right thing"". Try to stay alert to this, as the decision you make must be influenced by your self understanding rather than submerging your needs and wants in favor of expectations. Before starting a relationship, be sure it is being done on an equal footing that allows for full expression of who you are and isn't about caving in to expectations from other people. At the end of the day, it is you that will be in the relationship with another person and not any other people.


For example, well-meaning parents or friends, who are particularly insistent on rushing you into a relationship they feel bodes well for you could potentially deter you from thinking clearly. In the effort to please them, you risk losing sight of what benefits you; remember, you are not your parents, your friends or any other person. Be sure to only pursue such a relationship when you feel that you are ready or open to this new possibility.

, If you have come across a nice person who seems to match much of your ideal, don't wait too long to explain your first impression and good feelings, in moderation. Take action directly by asking for their name phone number, for a date, etc. (if it is practical). Or, if it's more practical, do so indirectly, by nonverbal communication, such as sending a greeting card, bouquet, etc. Be prepared to try again, nicely, without coming across as too intrusive or pushy.


Plan a compliment. Give a sincere, quick and simple compliment. Explain in a few words, to show that you are sincere. Beware though––if you have no good reason for such a compliment, then it is pointless to make it at all, as it may be flattery or worse, a lie. (It's good and precious to say, ""You're beautiful, to me!"", and mean it: because beauty is so much more than merely skin deep or bone structure. Then never take that kind of truth back... or it becomes a lie and makes you insincere.)

, Building a sound and lasting relationship is not the easiest challenge to work on. On occasion, compromises are needed on each side, in order for a relationship to grow and remain strong. The positive thing is that even if a relationship doesn't work out, you can always grow from your experiences of it, over time.

, Forgiving is better than trying to win a love-match by all means and losing your personal attractiveness. (Be wise and don't insist on winning ""all the time"".) Don't even try to seek an apology for little slip ups, or you will seem lacking in confidence or overbearing. Let an apology be real and spontaneous, rather than expecting or demanding it.

, Be honest about your likes and ways to attract your real match, not faking-out everyone with a false-front that will soon fail you both. In the long run, pretending doesn't work and the truths will appear.


Be kind, persistent, determined, generous, loving and lovable, serious and fun, as befits you.

, Nevertheless, many people are still searching too. Each is a good reason to be patient. If only 5 percent of your age group matches you and 90 percent of those are matched up right now, that leaves just 10 percent of 5 percent (just 1/10 of 5%). If so, that means half a percent of the right sort of people are available! Keep being available, always seeking. You will find your right match with determination and a willingness to remain open.

Learning to love yourself means accepting and appreciating the vulnerability within.You have many qualities that are unique to you. Learn to appreciate who you are and what you can offer.


If you have problems loving yourself, then work hard to build yourself up. Work on your self confidence by accepting your past and moving forward. You may feel that things you did in the past will make you unlovable, or that you have too many problems to be lovable. Untrue. Accept the things that happened to you, forgive yourself, and move on.
For more information, check out How to Love Yourself.;
, This can be difficult if you find yourself as a natural caretaker or if you have children. Remember, your ability to take care of others increases if you are adequately taking care of yourself.

Don’t let yourself become the last priority; instead, do things do show yourself you care. Treat yourself to a massage or a bath. Do one thing every day that is just for you.
This extends to maintaining boundaries and saying “no.” If what you need is some relaxation, say no to getting together with friends., Grateful people have health benefits and report higher levels of happiness.Find ways to be grateful for things that surround you, and most importantly, for who you are.


Think about the characteristics you have that you love about yourself. Maybe you are very compassionate, generous, or a good listener. Maybe you pick up new skills easily. Perhaps you create beautiful paintings or wire electricity like a pro. Take a moment and be grateful.

, Even if situations seem negative, find something positive, big or small. Having a positive outlook is linked with health and emotional benefits, such as lower rates of distress and having a longer lifespan.When you start to have negative thoughts, especially about yourself, turn them into positive thoughts.


Use positive self-talk to transform negative thoughts into positive thoughts.
Combat thoughts about new situations. Instead of “I’ll mess this up; I’m so foolish!” try “I feel proud of myself for trying something new and putting myself out there.”
If you think “I am so bad at meeting people” replace it with “I’m excited to learn new social skills and meet people more like me. I know I can succeed in making friends.”

, Being happy is part of showing love to yourself. Create a state of happiness by doing things that make you feel good. Do things that make your body, mind, emotions, and spirit feel good. Happiness largely depends on putting in the effort to make your life more positive.You can choose to meditate, practice yoga, paint or draw, kayak, hiking, practice Muay Thai or engage in lively discussions. Think about what brings a smile to your face, and go do it!

, An important part of self-care is to spend some time alone. It can be difficult if you share a room or have children, but saving some time for yourself is important. Solitude can help you unwind, work through problems, reboot your mind, and discover yourself. Don’t feel guilty for wanting alone time. By spending time alone, you can improve your relationships by prioritizing your happiness and allowing yourself to reset.It’s important to note that alone time doesn’t mean going on social media. Try to do things that enrich your life and make you feel good like taking a walk or journaling.
If you struggle to find alone time, wake up before other people, or spend your lunch breaks alone. Ask your partner to watch the kids for one hour each week so you can get out of the house and spend some time alone.

, Some people believe that happiness and love can only be experienced through a relationship, or that a bad relationship is still better than no relationship at all. Staying in a relationship that does not work does not respect you or your partner. Solitude is different than being lonely, and it is not worth succumbing to social pressure to fit in or feel complete.

If you are unhappy or impatient being single, make the best of the situation. Pursue opportunities that are difficult to accomplish with a partner or a family. Travel, acquire lots of close friends, and enjoy your perpetual freedom.

, Put forth effort into the relationship and work hard to make it work. Communicate openly with your partner about your goals for the relationship and where you see it going. If you're only interested in a short-term fling, be honest. If you've got an eye toward serious long-term love, be honest. There's nothing wrong with either kind of love, but you need to make sure that your partner is equally committed to the same version of love that you are.


Commit to the person and to the relationship. Put in work to make your partner feel special, and work toward making the relationship work.

, The word ""intimacy"" is often associated with sex, but being emotionally intimate is a huge part of a loving relationship. Emotional intimacy involves allowing yourself to feel and express vulnerability around your partner. Avoiding vulnerability can look like like withdrawal, attack, or accusations. On the contrary, intimacy can look like sharing fears, discomfort, and disappointment with your partner. Feelings or situations that previously felt unsafe feel safer in an intimate relationship because of the vulnerability and trust that has been developed.When you begin to feel vulnerable (like experiencing fear, sadness, shame, or hurt), take a moment and pause. Acknowledge whatever feelings come up and allow yourself to feel them; don’t avoid them. Take compassion on the feeling and be gentle with it.
Share your vulnerable moments and let your partner support you.

, If you’re concerned that the initial attraction and strong feelings of love are wearing off, realize that love can occur in waves. Sometimes you feel overwhelmingly in love with someone, and other times you experience less love to or from that person. Just because you hit a low point doesn’t mean that the feelings will last forever. Life happens in cycles and it’s okay that love experiences highs and lows.

Lots of things can create peaks and troughs in love, such as having children or growing older. You can work through them.

, You don’t have to be the one in control of the love in your relationship; let your partner express love toward you. Receiving love can feel vulnerable to some people because it requires letting go of control. Be open to receiving gifts, accepting compliments, and warm gestures toward you. You may feel like you now owe something back, but let that go and enjoy the experience of receiving. Love does not have debts but multiplies., Touching does not need to be sexual, but engaging in a long, supportive hug or reaching out for your partner’s hand is a way to stay connected. Express your love for your partner by initiating and sustaining physical contact. Affection is one way to express care, appreciation, and other connecting, positive emotions.

Affection is a way to make your partner feel loved and for you to feel loving.

, Sometimes the way we communicate with a partner can be lost in translation, but gratitude is always understood. Affirm your appreciation of your partner by expressing gratitude. Thank your partner to show that you notice the effort put into the relationship. Show appreciation for the things your partner does, and also for the qualities that your loved one embodies., The whole point of going through life with people you love is so that you can tackle life’s challenges together. Work together to find solutions, solve problems, and comfort each other when times get tough. We can’t solve everything on our own, we can’t know everything there is to know... but a whole bunch of people getting together out of love can solve just about any problem.

, Don’t expect perfection in the person you love or in yourself. This sets incredibly unrealistic expectations. Neither of you will be able to live up to these standards and you both will end up hurt and disappointed. Take it easy on yourself and your partner, and expect mistakes to happen.

, Yes, bad things will happen in your relationships. You’ll say the wrong thing, or your partner will hurt your feelings. It happens. The important part, when anything goes wrong (even if it’s just problems in your life), is to learn your lessons and keep moving forward. Try to make the most of any negative situation, turning it into something positive by gaining and growing from the experience. Honestly try to see your significant other's point of view in any argument that gets fairly serious.


If you're in the wrong, apologize and own up to your mistake. Good relationships air out the grievances and clear the air.

, It’s hard to feel love toward someone when you’re really mad or upset at your partner. Whether you and your partner become volatile or avoid fights, there’s actually no measured differences in couple happiness. The important part is finding happiness together after the fight.Be aware that there's always the opportunity for reconciliation. Whether you have volatile screaming matches or you sit down together to compromise before things get too heated, almost every style of conflict allows for some form of reconciliation. No matter how you and your partner fight, make sure you are, in the end, both feeling heard and able to come to some kind of agreement., Balance is important in creating a happy and loving relationship. Research shows that in relation to stability over time, the magic ratio for positive and negative interactions in relationships is five to one, or five positive interactions for every one negative interaction. When you recognize a negative action toward your partner, do your best to provide positive interactions to restore a sense of balance.Positive interactions include physical intimacy such as touching, smiling, and laughing.

, For example, teach her how to drive, or take her to a shooting club. The options are numerous.

, This doesn't mean you actually have to buy something outrageous just because she likes it. As a matter of fact, supplicating to her opinion would have the opposite effect. While you're there, make her try some sexy clothes. Girls love to dress up, even if they don't buy anything.

, Get her listening to your favorite music, or see your favorite movie.

, Don't explain where you're taking her, just tell her to trust you.

, Invite her to your place and have her help you cook a dinner.

, Ask her personal questions, and don't be embarrassed to talk about yourself. Make it a pleasant conversation. See the tips section for ideas.

, Girls are smart enough to handle their own lives. Ask her to share what's bothering her, don't ask what can you do to help her. Whereas the former makes you the empathetic person she'd fall for, the latter makes you the patronizing jerk who thinks a girl is too weak or stupid to solve her problems.

, Also, don't overdo it. A joke and an implication that you really want to be with her (and ""implication"" does not mean saying ""I wanna f*** you"" outright!) is OK, but if all you can say is sex-related jokes you look needy and horny.

, This is actually a therapeutic approach used by psychologists. After she's all cried out, she'll start to like you because you made her feel good (it's counterintuitive, but going through the sorrow instead of suppressing it is a great relief on the mind).

Just remember, be prepared.",How to Develop 5 Questions to Ask a Girl on a First Date," Use these 5 questions to ask a girl on a first date to open the evening and you will find her ready and willing to respond.


Ask her about her family life. Does she have a brother? If so, what's he like? Is he into sports, cars? Most girls adore their brothers, especially younger ones. If you can identify with her sibling you will do well.
Ask her about her job or education. Be careful not to express a need for either. She may have had reasons for not continuing her education or for having a stable career. Let her express herself and you gauge the desire to continue with the conversation topic or move on.
Ask her about her hobbies. This is always a good way to find out what she is really into. Most people glow about their hobbies because it is what they LIKE to do. When you identify her likes, continue with that topic for awhile and ask continuation questions. IE: If she likes cars, ask her what kind, what size motor, what color?
Always the safe question and maybe the most important is ""What's your favorite movie?"" This will tell you where her heart is. If she likes action and adventure, she will take risks, and maybe with you. If she likes romantic movies, great. Become the romantic dinner date and humorously offer to kiss her hand.
Ask her if she likes to travel and if she does, ask what places would she like to see. Maybe you have traveled and can offer some tips to her about that place.;

Look for trust.,
Realize that love always protects.,
Know that love is kind.,
Be aware that love is never selfish.,
Give love credit for being smart.,
Learn perseverance as love's virtue.,
Know the difference between jealousy and envy as one of love's expressions.,
Look for endurance.",How to Determine Love from the Counterfeits of the Heart1," Trust is the most basic foundation of love; it ensures that a relationship stays strong. Trust needs to be earned to establish ongoing confidence; it's not a given just because of who you are or what you've professed.


True lovers both give and receive trust. Although trusting can be scary, it is only by opening yourself up to love (and thus by letting yourself become vulnerable and trusting that the other person will not hurt you) that you truly discover the beauty in letting another person into your inner world. It's a feeling that lets you close your eyes and know that someone believes in you and will catch you when you fall. In other words, trusting fully allows you to fully feel love.
On the other hand, distrust is never part of true love. Henry Stimson once said that ""The only way to make a man trustworthy is to trust him""—remember that distrust cannot hold a love relationship together for long. If you find distrust and lies at the heart of your relationship with a person, it's counterfeit love.;
, When you love someone, you open your heart and start to care. You want to remain connected. Anything that concerns the other person will concern you too, even if you can just offer a shoulder to cry on or be a sounding board to bounce ideas off. The littlest pain and struggle of the the person you love troubles you, yet you also know that your love is strong enough to help and to protect the other person—you simply need to be there for him or her.


Love makes you protective without being invasive or controlling—you want to help when you can, reach out when it's needed and help guide to prevent unwanted outcomes for those still learning at any stage in life. Love causes you to get up at 3am in the morning to collect your exhausted partying teens instead of letting them travel home alone; love causes you to leave your huge pile of work early because your spouse sounded down over the phone that afternoon; love causes you to tell the local school that you've seen cars making dangerous turning maneuvers where children are crossing the road because you don't want to see children hurt; love causes you to send letters to your local representative complaining about damage to the local environment because you don't want your community to be hurt. Love brings out the protective self in you.
On the other hand, counterfeit love is shown through a control or neglect. When one person couldn't care less whether the other person is truly safe, healthy or happy, they are in a counterfeit relationship. Counterfeit love is also shown when a person simply ignores troubling signs and refuses to discuss helpful solutions because he or she fails to see it as any of his or her business. It's a way of pushing aside both relationships and community in favor of oneself. Lastly, counterfeit love often ascribes to the blame culture, where it's everyone else's fault and responsibility, not that of the person in question.

, Kindness enables you to see beyond what the biological eyes take in. Kind people look at happenings in life with sympathy and empathic understanding. Likewise, love is kind and encourages you to respond to life with goodness and thoughtfulness.


Being gentle and comforting, as well as taking a loving, kind approach in your relationships, will help to establish mutual respect and a realization on both sides. Each person will feel fully listened to and taken into account.
On the other hand, counterfeit love tends to be impatient and rude, always demanding and frequently abrupt. If there is little kindness in your relationship with another person, there is no true love either.

, Instead, love is about knowing how to give and to receive. When you love, you give yourself, unconditionally, to someone else. In return, you're given time, consideration and support. You find pleasure in reaching out. You want to be there for your loved one, and you expect nothing in return.


Your expression of love will differ according to your individuality; each expression will be unique and worthy in its own right. It's not the amount or the value of love that really matters, but the way that it motivates you to do all that you do.
On the other hand, counterfeit love exists when one person does all the giving and the other person does all the taking. It's selfish when one person insists on being supported without being willing to also give support.

, Love might be blind, but it's not corrupt or stupid—love reminds you how to behave. Love helps you truly understand the Golden Rule (""Do unto others as you would have them do to you"") that runs through many religions and secular traditions. Just as you model better behavior by being better behaved, you model loving behavior by being loving. Love inspires you to spread loving behavior by demonstrating it in all that you do. Give love the credit for being a smart approach to living your life.


For some people, a ""smart approach"" includes a faith-based approach to life, while for others it is more about being a good human based in sound/non-religious morals. Either way, love is deeply entwined with treating others right, whether they are lovers, coworkers, strangers or neighbors.
On the other hand, counterfeit love isn't smart. It seeks to constrict the world to a single viewpoint. It does not accept the ideas and beliefs of others. It excuses bad behavior from itself, but expects exemplary behavior from others.

, Perseverance is the virtue of standing and pressing on despite the odds. When you love someone truly, you enter into a deep commitment and a very close friendship. No matter what happens, you remain there for the one you love. In return, this person will stand by you when your chips are down. You will begin to understand one another even more deeply. As a result, your love will grow.


Paradoxically, in persevering, you also learn the art of letting go: you let go of petty worries and silly little concerns in order to be supportive of the person you love and to stand up for his or her needs. Ultimately, perseverance allows you to fully embrace your loved one for who he or she truly is, a quality more valuable than any other.
On the other hand, a lack of perseverance can be a sign of counterfeit love. A person who turns away from you when things are hard and refuses to be supportive is either a fair-weather friend or has simply been pretending to be loving you all along.

, Jealousy and envy are closely related in meaning but they're definitely different in outcome. Love can be jealous at times, but it's certainly never envious.



Jealousy is an occasionally legitimate emotion in response to the fear of losing someone you love. As long as its kept under control, it is a harmless emotion. However, do not let it grow because, like fire, it can result to mass devastation and loss when misused. Only use jealousy as driving force to challenge yourself to be a better lover.

Envy denotes a longing to possess something awarded to or achieved by another. It is often felt when you become bitter and resentful of someone's success and achievement. This makes you feel uneasy at the sight of another person's excellence or good fortune. It is accompanied with some degree of hatred and a desire to possess equal advantages. Love is never envious.
On the other hand, counterfeit love is awash with envy. If you're in a relationship where competitiveness and one-upmanship seem to rule the roost, then you're not sharing a loving relationship. Stop seeking to possess what other people have and start trusting in what you already have, and you'll be able to find true love.

, Love is not easily angered. It can survive through times of suffering. If you're truly in love with someone, you'll learn to endure difficult situations, including times when it seems as though your relationship cannot last. Endurance allows you to ignore the challenges that are raised when a loved one acts thoughtlessly or unkindly. Endurance lets you look beyond out-of-character behavior, difficult attitudes and challenging transition periods. Endurance allows you to always stand by the people you care about.


Suffering in love teaches you wisdom. It widens your understanding of how people can change over time while still being same person you have always loved. It teaches you to listen without judgement to your loved ones despite their mindset, cultural upbringing, values and principles. Through love, you learn to let people be who they are rather than seeking to change them. Instead, a loving relationship is based on acceptance.

On the other hand, counterfeit love seeks to control, manipulate and change people. It tries to force one preferred viewpoint on others, playing down the importance of diversity and differences. Moreover, counterfeit love does not endure––when things go wrong and the single viewpoint cannot be enforced, the relationship tends to disintegrate.

Use love to sidestep perfectionism.,
Discover that love keeps no records of wrong, although it does have healthy boundaries.,
Love even though you may lose.",How to Determine Love from the Counterfeits of the Heart2," Love is often referred to as being ""blind"". This adage exists because it connotes acceptance of a person in spite of imperfections. Love is a realization that no one is perfect, and allows you to love someone for his or her flaws and shortcomings. Love motivates you to look for the good in a person and to encourage improvement.


When you expect too much and your expectations aren't met, you feel disappointed. Avoid such disappointments by being resilient and flexible with your loved ones.
On the other hand, counterfeit love concentrates too much on flaws and failures, turning them into a reason to control, berate or be unkind toward another person. Counterfeit love is often conditional on a person behaving in a certain way. Seeking perfectionism in yourself and your relationships is like chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow—it's never attainable.

, Healthy love is about setting boundaries to protect your relationships and yourself. Healthy love begins with self love (not self absorption) and radiates from loving yourself.


Healthy love also learns to forgive and move forward, in the realization that harboring resentment is like holding a hot coal of anger—you are the only one who gets burned. Forgiveness is a big part of loving others, as is making it clear to people where your limits lay. It's not wrong or unloving to stand up to disrespect; it's a healthy sign of self-respect and setting boundaries for others to learn from.
On the other hand, counterfeit love does keep score, with a person frequently returning to occasions when he or she felt you hurt or upset his or her feelings. This scorekeeping can reach back years in the relationships of some people, with bitterness and resentment the only thing keeping people close. Such unhealthy love never learns forgiveness and results in ""lovers"" with little to no self esteem.

, Love never fails, even you feel like it has. Breakups (whether it's a romantic, workplace, business, friendship, etc.) can really hurt. Yet, love is worth the effort, even in those times when loss hurts you. For, as Alfred Lord Tennyson put it, Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. Love is therefore also about experience. You cannot shut yourself off from the rest of the world, no matter how afraid you are of loss.


By opening yourself up to the amazing possibilities of love, you open yourself up to all the beauty and wonder of the world too. Sometimes it won't work but on the law of averages, you'll experience more love than loss, especially if you don't tie down your notion of love to simple romantic love but embrace love as a way of being and thinking in all walks of your life.

Give it time.",How to Date a Nerd," Nerds often have social anxiety. They might have read somewhere that they should ask questions to keep the conversation going, but are so worried about what to say next that they don’t listen to your answer.Give the nerd time to open up to you. They’ll be better at listening once they feel more at ease.;
, Nerds often have a few very intense passions. Common nerd passions include computers, video games, and sci-fi. Nerds love talking about their passions, so be an avid listener if you want to capture a nerd’s interest.Listen for as long as you can. If you become too bored, gently steer the conversation in a different direction.
It’s alright if you don’t share some of the nerd’s interests. Keep an open mind. If you still find yourself drawn to a nerd after listening to them ramble about Star Trek for 20 minutes, it’s worth getting to know them better.

, Nerds understand “weird” passions or obsessions--they have some very intense ones of their own. To get a nerd’s attention, open up about your nerdy passions. Talk about your weird collection of porcelain cats, or your penchant for experimenting with puff pastry.Don’t worry if your quirky interests aren’t stereotypically nerdy--share them anyway. It’s the passion behind them that counts. Nerds can respect passion and dedication.

, Because nerds often have a difficult time with social cues, subtle hints are often lost on them. Be obvious in showing that you’re interested. Consider telling your nerd explicity that you want to date them.Say something like, “Hey, I really like you. We should spend more time together.”
Make sure you are sexually direct as well. Nerds often have a difficult time reading body language.

, Small talk describes the shallow and predictable conversations we have with people we don’t know very well. Nerds hate small talk. If you’re trying to spark a nerd’s interest, steer clear of small talk and jump to the deeper stuff.Small talk conversation topics include the weather, your surroundings, or traffic. Avoid these.
Instead, talk about one of your passions, the inspiring novel you just read, or your weird hobby.

, Let your quirks show through. Nerds love the challenge of deciphering a puzzle. By revealing your unique personality, you’ll keep a nerd engaged.Don’t try to change yourself to fit the nerd mold. If you are a nerd, that’s great! Otherwise, just be true to yourself. If you are truly compatible, this will be enough.

, While you don’t need to become proficient in Klingon, you should make an attempt to understand your partner’s obsessions. Follow some of the movies, books, and games that your partner loves. Who knows--maybe they’ll become your obsessions, too.A relationship is a two-way street. You should show some interest in your partner’s passions, and demand that your partner do the same for you.
Don’t worry if you don’t understand some of your partner’s passions. While some shared interests are important, you don’t need to share all of them.

, Your partner’s nerdy obsessions and social awkwardness make them who they are. You shouldn’t try to change them, and moreover, you won’t be able to. If you can’t accept them, then you probably shouldn’t be together.Don’t tease your partner for their mysterious obsessions. They’ve likely had to put up with such teasing their entire life, and more of it will only cause them to withdraw., Nerds often thrive on routine. They are very sensitive to change, whether it be at work, on the road, or at home. Simply moving an item in your partner’s room might upset them.You partner may have a designated space in the home where they like to work or pursue their hobbies undisturbed. They value the predictability and security of this space, so be certain not to violate any boundaries. Ask before cleaning their space or moving any of their things.

, If you are the type of person that craves spontaneity, dating a routine-oriented nerd might seem challenging. However, you can still do spontaneous things with your partner, like traveling, by combining more spontaneous activities with more structured activities.

For example, if you want to go on vacation with your partner, have a balance of very structured, highly scheduled days, and days that are more laid back.

, This might sound counterintuitive. Shouldn't the nerd be explaining to you? The truth is, you'll probably know more about many subjects than your partner. Nerds tend to specialize in one area of knowledge, which means you'll probably know more than they do about ""normal"" things (cars, pro football, non-science-fiction movies).Don't belittle your partner for not knowing much about mainstream topics. Instead, try patiently explaining.

, Respect is the cornerstone of any healthy relationship, and a relationship with a nerd is no different. Respect is often even more important to nerds, because they didn’t get much respect from their peers growing up.You shouldn’t only respect your partner for their technical skill. Respect them as a person.
You can show respect by listening to your partner's needs and desires, telling your partner you respect them for who they are, supporting your partner’s choices, and showing gratitude and appreciation for your partner in front of others., You don’t need to share all of your interests. It’s perfectly fine if you can’t wrap your mind around the beauty of coding or cosplay. That being said, every healthy relationship requires some shared interests. Find these, and explore them together.Try watching TV shows and movies that nerds and non-nerds alike can enjoy, like Game of Thrones or Star Wars.
Teach your partner about one of your own more obscure interests. They may come to find that they enjoy it, too!

, Nerds tend to be highly interested in topics that are relevant to their current passions and ignore those that are not. For example, you may find your partner has difficulty listening to your recap of your day. Let them know that this bothers you, and that you’d like their full attention.Tell them, “I really want to share my experiences with you, and it would mean a lot to me if you would listen.”
Remember, your partner is not trying to be rude! They just need a little wake-up call sometimes.

, Your partner’s friends are important to them. You should take an interest in them, despite the fact that they’ll probably be pretty nerdy, too. That’s not to say you need to spend every night LARPing together. Rather, make sure you hang out with them sometimes, ask them questions, and are generally friendly.You may not like all of your partner’s friends, but you should accept them. Try to understand and appreciate what they bring to your partner’s life., You partner should challenge you, and you should do the same for your partner. This is key for personal growth.Nerds love logic, so engage in some reasoned debates with your nerd. You’ll probably end up learning a lot, and grow closer to your partner at the same time.Pick a subject that you are interested in, and do a little research. Your passion will show through, making for a more engaging discussion.

, Conflict is inevitable in any relationship, nerd relationships included. However, because nerds are focused on facts, they don’t respond well to overly-emotional or illogical arguments. Focusing on logical arguments will help you address conflicts with your partner., Nerds often understand logic and facts better than they understand emotion. It may take a while for your partner to be able to open up to you, so be patient. It’s not that your partner doesn’t have emotions--they just have a harder time expressing them."

Caress her navel.",How to Caress a Woman," When you lean in for a kiss, you shouldn't try to plant your lips on hers and ram your tongue in her mouth. Instead, be gentle and take things slowly, especially at first. You should move in to give her a soft kiss and then pause to caress her lips with yours by holding the kiss for a few seconds. You can caress the top lip and then the bottom lip, showing her that kisses really matter to you.


Too many men look at kissing as a move that just leads to something else. You should treat kissing like it's a unique pleasure instead of making her think that all you want is more.;
, As you kiss the woman, hold her face with one or more of your hands. Don't grab her face at once, but slowly ease into this gesture and make it feel natural. Then, gently place a hand on the side of her face and stroke her cheek, her ear, her hair, and the side of her face along the jawline. This will make her feel loved and will even bring its own pleasure.


You shouldn't try kissing this way every single time. Instead, surprise her with this intimate gesture when the moment feels right.

, While you're kissing, you should try to gently touch her earlobes, the sides of her ear, and the area behind her ears. Do this slowly and gently, as you're cupping her face. You can slide your hand under her hair, and stroke her ear as you continue to kiss. A woman's earlobes don't get nearly enough attention, and most women love this.


If you're already intimate, you can also brush your lips along her ears — that will drive her wild.
This is almost always a great move, but make sure you check her expression to see how she likes having her ears touched. Some women's ears are so sensitive that they prefer that you don't touch them.

, The neck is another place where you can never touch a woman enough. Gently stroke the sides of her neck while you're talking, kissing, or just looking at each other. You can even toss her hair back so you can caress her neck a bit more, just by running the sides of your fingers up and down her neck, down to the base of her shoulder and all the way up to her earlobe.


If you're doing this while standing behind her, you can even blow a little bit of hot air onto her neck for added pleasure.

, Stroking her hair is another wonderful caressing gesture. You can gently stroke the back of her head and massage her scalp, run your fingers through strands of her hair playfully, or even brush the hair away from her eyes as you make eye contact, leading her to want something more. You can also stroke her hair as a way to also touch her cheeks, her earlobes, and her neck, and eventually to give her a kiss.


You can even tuck a strand of her hair behind her ear — this will give you an excuse to give her ears an extra caress.

, Caressing a woman's lips before you kiss her is another sensual gesture that she will love and be impressed by. The next time you're ready to kiss her, tease her a little by pulling back and then by running a finger along the middle of her lips. Give her a subtle smile as you do this before you lean in to give her a kiss in the place you just touched. She will be touched and surprised by this form of caress.


You can also give her a gentle kiss, pull away, stroke her lips with your finger, and then lean in for another kiss.

, Early in the relationship, caressing a woman's hands can be one of the safest and most intimate places to go. There's a difference between putting your hand in a woman's as if it's a limp fish, and in gently touching, stroking, and even massaging the woman's fingers and palms. If you and the woman are on a hand-holding or touching basis, then you can reach out to gently touch one or both of her hands and impress her with how loving and gentle you can be. Here are some things you can try:


Lightly trace a circle in her palm
Gently hold onto one of her fingers with two of yours and stroke it up and down
Massage her palm, knuckles, and outer hands

, If she is wearing a top that reveals her shoulders you should definitely run your hands along them. Gently touch her shoulder with the tips of your fingers and then stroke them downward with a bit more force. You can also run one finger along her shoulder to give her an extra bit of excitement. Remember that you don't have to caress her shoulders, ear, or the side of her face while you're kissing — this gesture can be intimate and special enough on its own.


Women also love to get massages. If you're alone and the mood strikes you, you can use both hands to firmly push into the area above her shoulder blades to knead out some of the tension in her body.

, The knee is another part of a woman's body that is overlooked all too often. If she is wearing a skirt or dress she will probably appreciate the warmth of your hand on her soft skin. You may also want to run your finger down into the bend of her knee. This is one of the many erogenous zones that can be found on a woman's body. Just don't try this move when it's hot out — she may sweat there a little, and you don't want to embarrass her.


You can also caress a woman's knee just by lightly stroking it when you're sitting down, even if she's wearing pants.

, If you know she is willing, you can slowly run your hand along the top of her leg then down along her thigh. This can be more of a sexual move that leads to more, or you can just touch her thighs for the sake of it. You should be pretty familiar with each other for you to try this move, though. Don't think she'll be okay with it just because you've reached the kissing phase.


When you're caressing her thigh, use a light touch instead of a squeezing motion, or she may feel a little overwhelmed.

, You don't always have to be facing each other or kissing each other for you to caress a woman. You can stand behind her and gently touch each of her shoulders, placing your head into the back of the side of her head and then moving your hands along her neck and shoulders with gentle and loving motions.


You can also leave one hand more firmly placed on her shoulder while sliding the other hand down her back, along the sides of her neck, and even down her arms.

, Stand behind the woman, move her hair to the side, and kiss the back of her neck while you move an arm to the bend of her waist and move your fingers up and down there gently, like you're kneading her. This is a place where women —as long as you're on intimate terms — really love to be touched.

, Women love to be hugged and to feel the gentle affection of a man's love. You can embrace your woman for a long time, but you should keep things interesting. Without getting too handsy and moving your hands too much, you can place one hand on the small of her back and gently move it up and down. This will make your woman feel loved, and if she's upset, this will help reassure her.


You can also place your hand on the small of her back when you're walking somewhere to lead her forward. Women love to be touched like this too.

, If you're sitting down and holding hands, you can gently stroke the inside of her wrist. This is a very sensitive area and she will definitely feel a tinge of pleasure when you touch her here. You can even trace a circle around her palm and then make your way down to her wrist. Then, you can even stroke her forearms and up to the crooks of her elbows.


Just make sure she doesn't feel ticklish — if she does, then she won't be feeling much pleasure. You want to keep your touch light but meaningful.

, Tracing the area of her spine above her lower back, up to her neck, and back down again can definitely make a woman feel more than a bit of pleasure. This is a very intimate gesture and it'll really send the message if you do it while you're hugging or holding each other. You can also try it when you're giving her a kiss, but that's not necessary.


This works best when she is wearing a dress or another fabric that allows you to easily trace her spine.
When you reach the bottom of her neck, consider giving her a kiss in that area.

, There are few things that some women love more than a good foot rub. The next time you're alone, just have her lie or sit down and place one of her feet in your hands. Then, gently massage the soles of her feet, the knuckles of her toes, the pads of her toes and feet, and even the area on the top of her foot. Be very gentle, at least at first, because her feet may be sore, especially if she's been on them all day, and then work your way up to massaging them more thoroughly, by kneading her feet with your fingers.


If you really want to give her a good foot massage, you can even rub some oil or lotion onto your hands.

, This is a more sexual area, but if you're at that point with the woman, then sometimes nothing can be better than gently caressing her on the navel. Gently trace the area around her navel and then move your hands slightly up or slightly down to prolong the pleasure. You can caress other parts of her body and then return to the navel if you really want to drive her wild.

Take the initiative.Even if it's usually guys that ask the girl out, you shouldn't wait around for him to ask you.,
Decide whether your offer should be open-ended or specific.Before you ask out the guy in question, you should take a moment to consider what your offer will entail.,
Pitch the movie to him before asking.If you're nervous about asking the guy to a movie, if helps to bring up the movie first.,
Keep it casual.A movie date is a casual outing, so the way you go about asking should be treated in much the same way.,
Be open to going in a group.There's a chance your original idea of a film date will end up encompassing a group.,
Find out what's playing.Simply enough, you'll need to find out what films are playing before you're able to pick something out.,
Pick a film that's suitable for a date.Romantic comedies and horror films are generally seen to be the best type of movie to take a date to.,
Avoid extremely popular films.If you're going on a date with someone, you're going to want at least some privacy.,
Contemplate the sort of movie he might like to see.,
Consider wearing perfume or cologne.If you want your date to be a hit, light perfume or cologne may be just the thing.,
Figure out payment for the film.,
Pick isolated seats.Even if the theatre isn't very crowded, it's still better to get seats that are relatively off to the back and isolated.,
Enjoy light touching together.,
Relax.",How to Ask a Guy You Like to the Movies," Take the initiative yourself and surprise him with your confidence. Although it helps to have a solid chemistry with the guy before asking him out anywhere, don't hesitate to ask


Because a movie date is so casual, it's perfectly fine to ask him out via electronic communication like text or private messaging.;
, An open-ended offer like ""Want to go to the movies sometime?"" carries a different implication than asking someone to go to a specific movie. While an open-ended offer is less interesting than something specific, it's a bolder way of letting someone know you're specifically interested in spending more time with them.

, That way, not only will he be more excited to go see the movie, you'll also have a natural way of guiding the conversation into asking about it.


The plot, starring case, director or genre are all things you might bring up while you're describing a movie.
Positive reviews will help your case. If the two of you have a twisted sense of humour, you may even want to go to a film with abysmal reviews. You may even bond over how terrible the movie was.

, Be kind and easygoing when you ask. Asking someone on a movie date should never be elaborate or overly complex. Most people love going to the movies, so chances are he'll say yes so long as you don't try to force an answer out of him.


Say something like ""Hey, would you like to see that movie tomorrow at 8? It's an action flick, and it's gotten good reviews.""

, Although you would think this will take away from the romantic appeal, you can still have an intimate experience with someone regardless if other friends have tagged along. If anything, if the two of you are currently nervous around each other, it can alleviate tension to have other people around.

, Check the movie showings at a theatre that is reasonably accessible for the both of you. If you haven't asked him out yet, knowing the movie times will give you the ability to specify your proposal to a time, place and chosen movie.

, However, you should ultimately base your decision around the type of films the two of you enjoy most. Although dramas and documentaries may be less suited for dates, they can still be a good idea if you think that would be more his thing.

, Although a movie theatre will never be truly private, you should nonetheless avoid films that have only recently come out or are selling a lot of tickets. Having some space to yourselves will increase the feeling of intimacy between the two of you.

, What movies does the guy you're interested in watch usually? Although a date should ultimately revolve around the couple, a good choice of movie will give you plenty to talk about. If the movie is something he'll like, he'll be more likely to say yes to your proposal.


In the case that the date turns sour, having a good movie to watch will mean the evening isn't a total failure.

, Because you'll be in a dark theatre throughout the course of the date, he won't be able to see you. Rather, you'll have touch and scent as your tools of attraction. A small dose of good-smelling stuff will make it easier to draw his senses to you.

, Most couples nowadays buy their own tickets if they're on a first date. However, if you're asking someone to the movies, you can also offer to pay for both tickets. If he insists on paying, feel free to let him if you're fine with that. Any of these routes are fine, so long as the two of you are happy about it.


How couples pay can vary by where you live. Ask your friends for advice if you're not sure what the local protocol is.
It's also fine to feel it out on the date. If your date seems uncomfortable with you paying, tell him you can each get your own tickets.

, A bit of extra privacy will give you two the chance to get closer together.

, Hand holding and cuddling are both good ways of expressing and enjoying attraction while in a movie theatre. This light touching is usually benign, and there's nothing keeping you from doing so while still watching the film relatively undistracted.


If you don't know how he'll react, lightly grazing his arm or leg with your hand leaves open the room for plausible deniability.

, At the end of the day, the two of you are there to enjoy a movie. Regardless whether it pans out into a longer-lasting relationship, you should be happy with the fact that you're out doing something fun with someone you find interesting. Chances are that if you relax, the two of you will have a higher likelihood of getting closer."

Decide what sort of guru you'd like to be.,
Decide whether you want to be a relationship guru as a career or vocation or just as something fun to do now and then.,
Be learned.,
Write articles of your own.,
Decide where you'll operate from.,
Define what a relationship guru is according to your own terms.",How to Be a Relationship Guru," You could an official relationship guru, holding a degree in psychology, theology, medicine, communications, social work, sociology, or some other related discipline. Or, you could be a guru based on a lot of experience in the field, helping others to get along in their everyday lives, at work, at home, on the sports field, or anywhere in between. Whichever way you choose, you will need to be credible, reliable and trusted. It might help to have expert qualifications but sometimes that can scare people away, so it comes down to who you are and how good you are with people.;
, If you're just wanting to dabble in it, then that's fine but if you want to make a bit of income out of being a relationship guru, then you will need to have good qualifications and/or experience for this role. Some of the possibilities among many include:


Invent the role from scratch. Make of it what you can, given the person you are.
Be a relationship psychologist/sociologist/doctor. Use your degree as the stamp of credibility and ability to help others.
Be a spiritual adviser focused on relationships. Perhaps you've had years of experience advising people spiritually, including in relationships.
Be a teacher, facilitator and guide. Use your teaching skills to help guide people to help themselves within a relationship.

, Read all that you can about relationships and relationship advice. Read quality materials in the areas of psychology, sociology, neuropsychology, medicine, self-help and more. Wherever you can find materials that are relevant, be reading and learning from them. Take good notes for future reference.


Learn the basics of conflict resolution and consider getting advanced qualifications in this skill. Nobody should be advising others on relationships without having at least some skill in this area. Conflicts are bound to be at the heart of almost every relational issue. Know how to spot them and help people find ways to deal with them constructively.
Consider developing a good reference library, either in real books or ebooks, so that you have good sources to refer to when you are offering advice, solace and help to people.

, Develop a website or a blog in which you offer advice. This is the perfect place for you to demonstrate your particular brand of wisdom and advice, allowing people to read your work and decide for themselves if you're the relationship guru for their needs.


Be sure to answer comments, so that people know you're interactive and ready to help.

, You may need premises, depending on how you're conducting your business or service as a relationship guru. If so, you could have a home office, a rented space, a hot desk in an incubator for new entrepreneurs, or a boat floating off the waters of Bali. It's up to you to decide where to locate and where you're likely to get the customers or interested persons coming to see you.


Consider offering a hotline contact or an answer-by-email service, or something similar, so that people can reach out to you for advice by phone or online. Some people may feel this is the most comfortable way to connect with you.

, At the end of the day, this is really about carving out a career or vocational niche for yourself. Anyone who truly aspires to being a ""guru"" also shouldn't go around calling themselves such, for the term guru is one that is earned, not self-anointed.

Ask open-ended questions.,
Confess something cute to your partner.,
Keep the conversation positive.,
Use “I” statements when you are talking.,
Tell stories.,
Interrupt your partner to agree or endorse what he or she says.,
Show your appreciation.,
Be sympathetic.",How to Carry on a Romantic Conversation1," Just like any other type of conversation, the best way to ensure that the conversation continues to flow is to ask open-ended questions. This means asking questions that cannot be answered with a simple “yes” or “no” so that your partner is encouraged to elaborate. This will help keep the conversation going. There are even certain questions you can ask that may help to bring you and your partner closer together.Some good questions to ask include:


“What would your perfect day be like?”
“What are three things that you think we have in common?”
“Do you have a dream that you have not yet had a chance to do anything about? If so, what is it?"";
, Once you have initiated the conversation with some romantic questions, another way to encourage a romantic conversation is to increase the intimacy between the two of you. A great way to do this is to cutely confess something to your partner that really elaborates on your feelings for them. This is a subtle way to say something romantic without being overwhelming. Just be sure the thing you “confess” is light and romantic in nature. For example:


“I have to admit something. I’ve wanted to hold your hand like this since the moment we met.”
“I have always wanted to know where you got that scar on your knee from.”
“I really want to tell you that I love the perfume you are wearing.”

, As you carry on the conversation, be sure to keep the conversation topics light and positive. Talking about things like money, work, or any problems in your relationship will ruin the romantic mood. Instead, stick to positive subjects like your future, what you love about your partner, and intimate aspects of your relationship. Tell your partner about your goals and dreams and ask him or her to share these as well.
Focus on showing your positive personality traits in the conversation as well. Are you outgoing? Accepting? Honest? Hard working? Whatever your positive personality traits are, try to find a few opportunities to showcase them.

, Using “I statements has been shown to help keep a conversation going if it starts to wane. Try telling your partner something surprising about yourself to keep things interesting.For example, if the conversation starts to wane, you might say something like, “I have always wanted to go to Antarctica.”

, Great stories can help to connect you with another person, so choose a few of your best ones to share with your partner. Good stories to tell are ones that reveal something about you, such as how you ended up moving to the city you live in now, how you decided on your college major, or how you met your best friend., Although you should not interrupt your partner most of the time. It is okay to briefly interrupt your partner to express agreement acceptance of something he or she has just said.For example, if your partner mentions a band he likes, then it is okay to interrupts with something like, “Oh yeah! I love that band too.” Then, be quiet again and allow your partner to finish what he or she was saying.

, Showing appreciation for your partner’s experiences and opinions can also be a great way to enhance the romance of a conversation. Make sure that you acknowledge your partner’s interests and accomplishments during your conversation.For example, if your partner mentions something that he or she likes to do or mentions a recent accomplishment, then you can say something like, “That’s awesome!” or “I think that is so cool!”

, Sometimes your partner might mention something bad that happened or express something that he or she has struggled with in the past. When this happens, make sure that you acknowledge your partner’s statements with sympathy.For example, if your partner shares a challenge or a struggle with you, then you might say something like, “That seems like it must be difficult,” or “It’s terrible that you had to deal with that.”

, Pull out that old stack of board games you haven’t played in a while and make a date of it.You can get together for a game night at home, the park, or even the library.

Make eye contact.,
Hold hands or touch your partner now and then.",How to Carry on a Romantic Conversation2," Engaging in a romantic conversation in person requires confidence in yourself and confidence in your relationship. You want to let your partner know how you feel, and you want to give your partner a chance to do the same. As you start the romantic conversation, it is important to be open and secure. If you start the conversation but restrain yourself too much, your partner will pick up on your discomfort and may be put off.


Avoid aggressive body language like crossed arms or lots of hand gestures.
Try to keep your body language loose and welcoming by keeping your arms at your sides and facing your partner.
Smile at your partner to show that you are having a good time.

, While being romantic with your partner, you want to be sure that your body language and your words are conveying the message. Even if you say the most romantic thing in the world, your partner will not feel romanced if you’re saying it while looking at the menu. Make sure you are giving your partner all of your attention during the conversation. Don’t look around the room or fidget, as this comes across as uncomfortable or uninterested.

, Making eye contact with your partner is one of the best ways to enhance your intimacy and connect with each other without saying a word. Make sure that you maintain eye contact whenever your partner is speaking to you as well as while you are speaking to him or her., Touch is an important factor in enhancing romance between two people as well. Make sure that you and your partner engage in some physical contact during your conversation.For example, you can hold your partner’s hand or just lightly stroke the back of your partner’s arm while he or she is talking.

Offer your partner some chocolate.",How to Carry on a Romantic Conversation3," Self-care has been found to be a major factor in whether or not people are perceived as attractive.

Don’t bring up your financial situation on the first date.,
Don’t wait too long to reveal your money troubles.,
Share your plans for getting back on track financially.,
Give your date an easy out, if needed.",How to Date if You Are Broke3," While honesty is always good, extremely personal details don’t need to be shared until after you’ve gone out with the same person several times and plan to continue seeing him or her. Let your date get to know you before bringing up money concerns., Even though you should avoid discussing your financial woes on the first date, you can’t keep that information secret forever. If you plan to continue dating the same person, you’ll need to be honest with them at some point.


A reasonable time to tell someone about your financial situation is about one month into dating, if you’ve already gone out several times during that first month.To bring up the topic of money, try starting the conversation by saying something like, “I’m really glad we met and I like spending time with you. I hope we continue dating so I want to be honest with you and let you know that I don’t have a lot of money right now.”

, You don’t have to give your date a detailed outline of everything you are doing or plan to do to get back on your feet financially. Just give them an idea of the general steps you are taking, such as applying for a new job. Knowing that you are doing something about the situation can be reassuring to the person you are dating.

, Even if the person you’ve been dating has enjoyed their time with you, they might be uncomfortable with your financial situation. Avoid making them feel bad if they don’t want to continue dating. End the dating relationship on good terms.


Try saying something like, “I’ve had a lot of fun with you and I don’t mind hanging out as just friends it that works best for you.”
You can say something else such as, “I understand if you want to take a break from dating for a while. I can always get in touch with you once I get back on my feet financially, if that’s okay with you.”
If the person you’ve been dating does want to take a break after you’ve revealed your money troubles, that doesn’t mean you have to begin dating them again later. In fact, you might choose not to go back to dating someone who was uncomfortable with you being broke at the time. Just don’t fault them for feeling that way.

Be yourself—and on your best behavior.,
Mirror the behavior of his family.,
Keep physical contact to a minimum.,
Respect his family.,
Avoid mentioning relationship problems.,
Go home if you’re uncomfortable.",How to Act on a Movie Date at Your Boyfriend's House," You might be really nervous about going to your boyfriend’s house, even if you know his family already. Asking your boyfriend questions about his family can help you start conversations. Not only can this break the ice, but it also creates a good impression of you and shows that you care enough about your boyfriend to be interested in his family.Find out things your boyfriend’s family likes and any special news they may have. Don’t focus on anything negative. It’s better to be able to say, “Mrs. Schmidt, Peter said you got a great job offer. That’s awesome! What will you be doing?” than, “Mr. Schmidt, Peter said you got pulled over by the cops for speeding last week.”
Make sure you get information on every family member, including small children. This will allow you to engage them in conversation, too. For example, “Anna, your big brother said you know your colors! Can you tell me them? What color shirt am I wearing?” Show genuine interest and ask questions. This will let them do most of the talking while you appear friendly.;
, Movies at home can be casual and your outfit should reflect that. Wearing a clean and comfortable outfit and simple makeup can help you enjoy the movie and be appropriate for the occasion.Set out a couple of different outfits for yourself. For example, you could wear skinny jeans, a comfy sweater or cardigan, and a pair of comfortable boots. You could also wear a pair of loose jeans with a white shirt and a pair of cute sneakers. These types of outfits keep you comfortable and classy.
Avoid wearing anything that is too tight, see-through, low-cut, or ripped – keep it classy and conservative.
Apply simple makeup that lets your natural beauty show. A little blush, mascara, and light-colored lip balm is perfect for a movie date at your boyfriend’s house.

, Your boyfriend’s family is opening up their home to you when you’re invited for a movie. To show your gratitude for their kindness, bring them a small gift, such as a box of chocolate or some snacks for the movie.Take something that is appropriate for the occasion. You can ask your boyfriend what his family likes, such as chocolate. If your boyfriend has small siblings, consider bringing them something like a coloring book; if his younger sister likes dolls, bring her a Barbie.
Bring snacks for the movie including chips, popcorn, ice cream, or pizza. Ask your parents to help you out if you need a couple extra dollars.

, When you get to your boyfriend’s house, it’s important to greet his family warmly if they are home. This can put them—and you—at ease and be the start of a great evening.Take a deep breath as you approach his family to help you relax. Then smile, shake hands, say hello. Look into your boyfriend’s parents’ eyes as you shake their hands and say, “Hello Mrs. Schmidt.” Show respect by calling his parents “Mr.” and “Mrs.” unless they tell you to use their first names.
Give your boyfriend a hug to say hello. You may not know his family’s feelings about public displays of affection, so a hug is a safe way to show love without making anyone uncomfortable.

, You might still be nervous, even if everything is going well. Relax and be yourself as much as possible. Being a bit nervous can show your boyfriend and his family that you really care about making a good impression.Err on the side of caution when it comes to expressing personal opinions or taking over conversations.


Chat with your boyfriend’s family before the movie starts if you are watching the film together. Don’t express too many personal opinions if you don’t know them very well. Their views may be different than yours and you wouldn’t want to offend them.
Avoid behaving in a way that you wouldn’t normally. For example, if your boyfriend and/ or his family enjoy commenting on the trailers or talk a lot during the film, do what makes you comfortable. This could be joining the chat or just smiling and keeping quiet.
Keep your behavior transparent. For example, if you’re watching the movie with your boyfriend in his bedroom, leave the door open so there isn’t any question about what you’re doing. If you and your boyfriend are sharing a blanket, consider keeping your hands visible so that no one worries you and your boyfriend are doing anything inappropriate.

, Your boyfriend’s family might watch the movie with you. In this case, look to his parents or other family members to cue you on what behavior is acceptable. Allow them to set the tone—casual or formal. This shows respect for his family and home. It can also ensure that you are invited back.Even if you are watching the movie without your boyfriend’s family, respect their wishes about things such as the lights. Allow them to check in on you and ask questions as they wish.

, Watching a movie together can be very romantic. It may make you feel like snuggling or kissing your boyfriend. Save kissing, flirting, or any other physical activities for when his family isn’t at home.


Remember that you are there to watch a movie, not show how much you care about each other romantically. Even if you are in your boyfriend’s room and his family is in the house, keep your physical contact appropriate. For example, you could hold hands or sit touching one another. All of this shows respect for yourself, your boyfriend, and his family.
Let your boyfriend know your comfort level with contact. For example, you could say, “I’m not comfortable with more than holding hands in your house. Maybe that will change in the future, but for now, this is good for me.”

, Every family has different ways of behaving and rules for family members. Keep in mind that your boyfriend’s family may have different rules than your family. If this is the case, remember that you are in his house and need to respect his family’s rules. This can ensure that everyone enjoys the movie and creates a good impression of you.Talk to your boyfriend about any behaviors that you should avoid. You may also want to know about what rules his family may have. For example, they might find holding hands inappropriate or not like it if you wear shoes in the house.
Stay out of disagreements or arguments. If there is negative conversation about your boyfriend, avoid giving your opinion, even if you are asked. Instead, say, “Oh, I’m sorry, I don’t know about that.” If you and your boyfriend have a disagreement or argument, say, “Let’s talk about this another time.”It’s best to avoid sensitive issues like politics and religion. If they come up, just be polite and say you’d prefer not to discuss it at the moment.

, Family members want to know that your boyfriend is happy in your relationship. Reassure them of this with stories about upcoming plans such as prom or going on a challenging hike. Even if you are having problems with your boyfriend, smile and be positive.


Keep in mind that you are there to enjoy a movie date, not discuss relationship issues. Mentioning these problems to him or his family can make the date uncomfortable. Remember that your boyfriend’s family will always take his side if there are problems.
Avoid asking about your boyfriend’s ex-girlfriends. For example, asking your boyfriend or his family, “Did your/ his ex ever come over for a movie?,” is inappropriate and may make them uncomfortable., If anything happens or is said that makes you uncomfortable, excuse yourself politely from the date. This can relieve any tension, prevent further discomfort, and make you feel better.Avoid making it obvious that you’re uncomfortable. Politely excuse yourself at a convenient moment. For example, you can say, “I’m really sorry, but I have to be going. I’ve got some things to do at home. Thanks so much for having me over and I can’t wait to see you again soon.”
Let your boyfriend know that you are fine, but need to rest. Don’t tell him you are uncomfortable or were upset about something. This may cause problems between you and your boyfriend or his family.

Ask about topics that you know he finds interesting.,
Stay informed.,
Talk about hypothetical situations.,
Ask him to tell you something you don't know.,
Ask him things that are quirky.,
Be complimentary.,
Discuss the future.,
Play a game.,
Listen actively.",How to Think of Stuff to Talk About with Your Boyfriend," People in general are most comfortable talking about themselves or their interests. Why? Because it's something they know pretty well and have mulled over. Here are some ideas for things to ask about:


How his day went
His past experiences (like where he lived as a kid, what he liked doing, who's important to him in his family)
His hobbies
His favorite activities
His favorite books, movies or music.;
, If you can find time to watch or read the news, you'll have more topics floating around your mind. Keep up on current events, funny clips of comedy shows, or viral internet stories. When the conversation lulls, ask your boyfriend if he's heard of what you read or saw recently. If he has, you two can talk about what you think. If not, now is the perfect time to tell him all about it.

, Would you rather be blind or deaf? Would you choose subsisting solely on spinach over listening to Christmas songs for 8 hours a day for the rest of your life? Try to come up with interesting, funny or complicated situations, and ask your boyfriend what he'd prefer. When he answers, ask him to defend his choice.


Play devil's advocate. Present a counterpoint to whatever your boyfriend says, so that he's forced to re-evaluate his choice. Make it clear that you're just trying to make the conversation more interesting––you're not actually trying to disagree at every turn.
Some more hypothetical questions to ask: ""What keeps you awake at night?"" ""If you could live your life to this point over again, what would you do differently?"" and ""What couldn't you live without?"" (or, ""If you could only keep 10 things, what would they be?"".

, It can be something about himself, or a fact you don't know. Whatever it is, you're sure to learn something. If you want to be more specific, ask him to tell you something new about one of his hobbies.


Nostalgia is a good bet here. Ask him about his first memory, his first day at school, his first toy and his first birthday party that he can remember. It's a great way to get to know about the things that matter to him and what he was like when he was a child.

, This can lead to fun, entertaining questions when you're both already in a good mood. Questions like: ""Do you still believe in Santa?"", ""If you had to choose between the TV and the Internet, which one would you get rid of?"" and ""If there were no clocks, what do you think life would be like?"". Keep the conversation light and amusing, no answer is the wrong one!


Tell him a few jokes that are quite funny and laugh along with him (provided he has a good sense of humor).

, Tell him how, and why, you loved a particular date. For an example you might say, ""I loved when you took me out to dinner. It was such a beautiful restaurant that it made me feel extra special.""

, Talk about the things you'd like to do someday––maybe you want to visit Crete, star in a play, write a novel, or live on a boat. Ask about what he's dreamed of doing. Here are some possible topics:


Where you want to go to school
What you want to study
Where you want to live
Where you want to travel
Possible hobbies
What job you want to have.

, It could be a board game, online game, or video game––whatever you choose. If you're competing against each other, you can gently trash talk and rib your boyfriend. If you're playing on the same team, you can discuss strategy and gameplay. Try these classics:


Chess
Checkers
Scrabble
Speed
Egyptian Rat Screw
Sorry

, The art of talking with another person includes a lot of listening that encourages the other person to talk more. Show your boyfriend that you're genuinely interested in what he has to say by acknowledging the things he says, using affirmative statements and body language as he speaks and summarizing aspects of what he tells you so that he knows you've taken it on board.


If it's early in your relationship and you encounter a lot of silences, try to keep conversations to no more than an hour at first. Talking too much can make even a fresh relationship seem stale and boring.
Let him know you're still there. Small talk can turn into silence very quickly.

Do things to make her happy.,
Make time for her.,
Encourage her to pursue things that make her happy.,
Think about her.,
Take an interest in her feelings, thoughts and opinions.,
Appreciate the things she does for you.",How to Treat a Girl1," Treat your girl right by doing things to make her happy. Don't do these things expecting favors in return or because you want something from her. Instead, do them because you think she deserves them and because you really want her to be happy. She can tell the difference between things you do to get what you want and things you do because you love her.


For example, you can turn the tables and learn how to crochet, just to make her a scarf for once.
You should try to do things that make her happy based on things that she cares about and that matter to her. If she's a huge rock climbing fan, for example, make a special custom pouch for her chalk.
Be polite. Some women expect you to hold open doors for them and pull out their chair. Some women will be offended by this behavior. You’ll have to work out with your girl what she wants from you but some basic politeness is always in order. Don’t burp or fart around her. Give her an arm to lean on when she’s walking in high heels. Help her carry things when her arms are full or the items are heavy. This is basic politeness and the same sort of thing that you should do for anyone, not just women.;
, Relationships mean being together. If you're not willing to make time for her in your day then what does that tell her. Set aside time in your week for going on a date, even if it's free and low-key. Text her and spend some time talking to her on the phone. She should be high enough in your priorities that you're willing to break a date with your friends in order to go to a movie with her.


While you should make her feel like she gets 1-on-1 time with you, you can also help her to feel like you're paying attention to her by taking her with you to hang out with your friends. As long as you're affectionate even when you're around other people, she'll usually still come away feeling like she got some good time in with you.
Of course, it’s important for her to have alone time to. Her independence is very important. Don’t take up all of her time and make sure that she is able to hang out with her friends and do things with them regularly.

, You should encourage her to do the things that make her happy. This is one of the most important roles in a relationship: we give each other support and make each other better people. When you do this for her, by showing her how important it is to chase her dreams, you'll really be treating her right.


For example, maybe she's mentioned how much she likes to write songs for herself. Encourage her to set up a YouTube channel so that she can share those wonderful songs with the world.

, When you open yourself up to thinking about her, it will show and make her feel really good and loved. Let things remind you of her, think of her when you hear about events she might enjoy, and enjoy remembering things that you've done together. When you do these things, it will often show in little ways that she will notice.


For example, you'll be walking down the street and see a picture in a shop that reminds you of that one time you went to the beach together. Buy her the picture and give it to her, telling her what it reminded you of and how good it made you feel. She'll just melt.

, When you take an interest in her feelings, thoughts, and opinions, it will make her feel respected and appreciated. This is a good way to treat a girl, making her happy and grateful for the relationship that she has with you.


Ask her what she thinks about things. Not just what she thinks about broad topics like music or television, but also ask about how she feels about current events, politics, and the things going on in your lives. This will help her to feel respected. The same goes for asking her opinion on problems you have in your own life.
Pay attention to her feelings and learn how to tell when she's upset, tired, angry or happy. Once you recognize these feelings, support her when she needs it and let her talk about things that make her happy or excited. Comfort her when she's sad, even if it means just being a silent shoulder to cry on. You can say something like, ""You seem like you're having a tough time. I don't know what's bothering you but I hope you know that I'm here to listen if you want to talk.""

, Taking someone that you love for granted is really easy. However, this can really ruin relationships. No matter if you've been together for five months or five years, you should never assume that someone ""should"" do something for you. When she does something nice for you, thank her. Never expect things from her and show your gratitude when she does do nice things.


For example, let's say that she makes you dinner. Don't just complain about how it tastes. Instead, thank her and offer to clean up the dishes.

Prioritize communication.,
Know each other’s schedules.,
Talk via webcam.,
Email or text.,
Send mail.",How to Not Miss Your Partner in a Long Distance Relationship1," Making time to talk to each other every day is extremely important to maintaining a long-distance relationship. It helps you stay connected, be informed about what is happening in each other’s lives, and miss each other less. Commit to calling each other once a day (or as frequently as schedules will permit).Agree on how many times a day/week you will talk to each other. Try to have a standing date to talk (for example, before bedtime). Let your partner know ahead of time if you will need to cancel for another reason.
You could say, “Because we’re not able seeing each other every day, let’s try to talk as often as possible. Can we call each other every night before bed? It would be nice to hear your voice before I go to sleep.”;
, Just as you would likely have an idea of what your partner was doing each day when you were living in the same place, inform each other of your daily schedules. It helps you stay connected and figure out when you can get in touch with each other.You could keep a copy of your partner’s daily schedule in your phone or in your calendar.
It’s nice to think about what the other person is doing at that moment. It helps you feel connected to them. While you are eating your lunch, you could think, “Michael is probably driving to work right now.”

, Using a webcam is a great way of helping you feel better about the distance. Just seeing your loved one smiling and hearing their voice can make you feel better and more connected to them. Regular webcam calls can make the distance seem shorter.


Many new computers/monitors come with webcams and microphones already installed. If you do not have either, they are fairly inexpensive to purchase, and well worth the investment if you have a long distance relationship!
You can use your webcam in conjunction with a variety of programs, like Skype or social media applications (like Facebook).
You can also make video calls using your phone, using things like FaceTime or Google Hangouts.

, Send little messages to your significant other throughout the day to let them know you are thinking about them. Let them know how your day is going. You could check in them by:


Texting on the train on your way to work. (If your partner is abroad, consider using WhatsApp to cut down on text message costs.)
Emailing at work about your day.
Sharing news or a joke on a social media app.

, Getting a letter or card in the mail can brighten someone’s day. Whether you write a letter or clip out an article in your hometown paper you know your partner would appreciate, it’s nice for your partner to receive a tangible reminder of your relationship when you’re not there.


Pick out a thoughtful card that reminds you of your partner or your relationship.
Send a care package. They are fun to assemble and to receive!

Be open about your goals.,
Be timely with communicating disinterest.If someone is not holding your interest, don't feel obligated to accept a second or third date.,
Do not assume exclusivity until it's made explicit.,
If you don't want to be exclusive, just say so.,
Be exclusive with your physical affection and emotional intimacy.",How to Date With Integrity," Have a goal in mind when dating, and make that goal clear as early as possible. Whether you are looking to date around after a breakup or a serious mate with whom to raise children, state your goal on your online profile or discuss it in person by the third date if you are not sure the other person is on the same page.;
, Politely decline with a, ""It's been wonderful meeting you and getting to know you better. I'm not sure this is the best fit though, and want you to be able to maximize your time finding someone who is right for you."" If it has been a week after a date and no one has made contact, it is okay to let the communication simply die down.

, This is the ""Define the Relationship"" talk, usually occurring 3-10 dates in, when one or the other person would like to make the relationship exclusive and stop ""seeing other people."" This alerts the other party of the potential need to become exclusive as well. Prior to this discussion and mutual agreement of exclusivity, both parties are free to date others without restriction or the need to even mention it. Afterwards, dates with others should be pruned off.

, Don't promise that you will stop seeing others unless you are really going to. It is fine to say, ""I like you, Jamie, and would like to continue seeing where this goes. I'm not ready to make this exclusive though."" And it is then Jamie's right to continue the non-exclusive dating as before, or to seek someone who will be more ready for exclusivity.

, It is important to respect the boundaries of your newfound relationship, which generally means limited physical affection towards others who you may potentially be attracted to (brief hugs are usually the limit). Also, work on your relationship so you can talk through problems and develop a close emotional connection. If you are spending more hours per week talking to any individual other than your partner who is not either family or an old, close friend, beware of becoming attracted to this other person and potentially betraying the emotional, romantic connection between you and your partner. It is fine to have casual friends of both genders, but if romantic feelings may potentially develop between you and a friend, try to limit contact with them to once a week or every few weeks.

Speak with respect.,
Understand her.,
Have a discussion when you have problems.,
Compliment her in the right ways.,
Watch what you say.,
Generally be truthful but lie smart when you have to.",How to Treat a Girl2," When you talk to her, speak with respect. You should never rudely criticize her or say things which are demeaning. Just like it wouldn't be acceptable for someone to say these things to you, it's not acceptable for you to say those things to her.Try to think not only about how you'd feel if someone said something to you but also think about how her own experiences might lead her to feel about what you said.


For example, only call her a girl if she is one. Is your girl older than, say, 20 years old? At that point you should be calling her a woman or a lady. When you call her girl, you're making her seem like a child, implying that she can't do things for herself, think, or act like the capable adult she is.

, Get to really know her for who she really is, not just what you think she is or want her to be. Ask questions about her. Dig deep. Take an interest in what she says, what she does, and what she wants. She'll notice that you do these things and it will show her that not only do you care about her but that you also respect who she is as a person.


Ask questions about her religion, her political views, what it was like for her growing up, what she wants for the future.
You can also ask the usual questions like her favorite color or food, but these kinds of things need to be balanced out with a deeper understanding of who she is.
Listen to what she says. When she talks, you should be listening. Don't tune her out because she ""talks too much"". Pay attention because you might learn things about her that you didn't know before., Instead of fighting and insulting each other when you have a fight, talk things out. If you really want to treat both her and yourself right, talk about things that bother you when they happen or very soon afterward. Bottling things up and ""keeping score"" will just make both of you miserable.


You also shouldn't talk behind her back. A lot of the time it's easier to complain about your girlfriend to everyone except for your girlfriend but this isn't fair to her and it isn't helpful for you. Solve the problem instead by talking to her calmly and finding a solution together.

, Of course you should give your girl lots of compliments but if you really want to treat her the way she deserves to be treated, you might want to pay attention to how you give those compliments. With a little understanding, you will be giving great compliments that make her heart just beat off the chart.


You don't want to give them out all the time for no reason at all because it will devalue them.
You should focus on complimenting her when it matters, such as when she works really hard or does something really kind.
You should also watch the language that you use. Sometimes, even though a guy means to say something nice, he accidentally says something that is hurtful.

, You have to be careful about how you talk because it can reveal a lot about how you think and also make the woman you’re with very uncomfortable. Don’t be vulgar, make off-color jokes, or be deliberately impolite (like farting in front of her). You also don’t want to talk rudely about people or talk about how sexy other women are. All of these things may make her feel uncomfortable or hurt and you don’t want that.

, When you talk to her, be truthful. Lying to her, even to be kind, isn't helpful and it won't help you to build a relationship of trust. Don't tell her you'll be helping your sick grandma when really you just don't want to go see a chick flick with her. This kind of behavior is disrespectful and sets a bad precedent. When you know that telling her the truth is going to be not only painful but also unproductive or unhelpful, try to lie by omission instead.


If she asks you something like the proverbial ""Does this make me look fat?"" question, then instead of saying something inevitably hurtful, turn the statement around and tell her a truth. You can say something like, ""I love the way that dress makes your body look but I think the yellow dress was way prettier overall.""

Don't see her as being any different than yourself.,
Stop trying to attract other women.,
Listen when she says no.,
Respect her privacy.,
Tell her how you feel.,
Trust her and be trustworthy yourself.",How to Treat a Girl3," It's easy to think of girls like a different species and think that you don't understand them. However, girls really aren't any different than you. They want the same things, they have the same problems, and they have the same feelings.When you realize that, it will be much easier to realize how you should treat them: treat them how you would want to be treated.


If it's easier, think of how you would want someone to treat a woman that you love. Treat a girl the way you'd want your dad to treat your mom. Treat a girl the way you'd want a guy to treat your sister.

, You want to look fly all the time. That's understandable. Who wouldn't want all the ladies to fall over themselves whenever they walk through a room? However, if you already have a girlfriend or a girl you like, working really hard to attract other women is disrespectful and rude to your girl. Just worry about looking hot to her and don't worry so much about what other women like. You shouldn't be flirting with a girl that isn't your girlfriend. You also shouldn't be showing off your body to other women.

, When she says ""no"" it doesn't mean ""maybe later"". It doesn't mean ""I'm being coy"". It doesn't mean ""I'm trying to make you mad"". It means ""no"". Don't continue to bother her after she's told you no. She knows what you want and she'll let you know if she changes her mind.


For example, if you ask her to wear a particular item of clothing and she doesn't like it, don't keep pressuring her to wear it.

, She's allowed to have secrets from you, just like you're allowed to have secrets from her. You're both entitled to have time to yourselves and things that are just yours. Do not invade her privacy by doing things like stalking her on Facebook or checking her text messages.


The temptation can be really strong if you see that she's left her internet browser logged in or something like that, but you should still resist. It's the gentlemanly thing to do.

, A lot of guys will worry about seeming manly. You don't want to seem weak, right? So they don't tell their girl how they feel. This is a huge mistake.Leaving her to wonder how much you really care is just mean. You wouldn't like it if she did that to you, right? When you care about someone, you should always tell them. Tell them when you mean it most and show them how much you care in little ways every day.


Don't hide it from others either. Your bros might tease you but they really understand: they've had girls they like a lot too. Take the teasing and make your girl happy by holding her hand when other people are around. It shows her that you're not ashamed of the close relationship that the two of you share.

, Trust is the absolute most important thing in a relationship. You can't have a happy relationship if you don't trust each other.This means that you need to give her the benefit of the doubt. Don't sweat it when she wants to hang out with her friends instead of hanging out with you. In your own behavior, don't do anything that would give her a reason not to trust you.


Don’t tell other people about the things you and your girl do behind closed doors, even if you’re just telling your best buddy. This is an invasion of privacy for your girl and can be very hurtful for her. All it takes is an argument with your best friend and that secret that you shared is posted on the internet for everyone to see.

Plan your next visit.,
Surprise each other.,
Display mementos.,
Plan for the future.,
Encourage each other.",How to Not Miss Your Partner in a Long Distance Relationship2," Having something to look forward to will help you be less frustrated about the distance. Talking about being together and planning what you want to do can help you feel like your relationship is going somewhere.


Look at your calendars and determine when one of you can come visit. Research transportation options if necessary and find out how much a visit will cost.
Remember it is best (for both your wallet and your peace of mind!) to book a trip well in advance.
If you do not share a bank account, decide ahead of time how you will split the cost of the trip. If you do not share finances and are always the one traveling to see your partner, it may not be fair that you are paying for each flight on your own. You could say, “Maria, let’s talk about budgeting for my next visit. Since I’ve paid for my last two flights, can you pay for this one?”
Talk about the things that you will do with each other when you are reunited with your partner, in order to build excitement and anticipation.

, Long distance relationships are a lot of work to maintain. Scheduling calls and visits can take a lot of the fun out of the relationship. So make attempts to surprise your partner as much as possible.Send a gift for no reason. When they call to thank you, you could say, “I heard the author of that book being interviewed on the radio. It sounds like something you’d really enjoy. It made me think of you.”
Call unexpectedly, just to say you love them.
If the budget allows, surprise them with an unexpected visit. Do some detective work ahead of time to ensure they’re going to be free during the time you want to go.

, Have reminders of your relationship around your home. Even though your partner may be far away, putting up pictures or other little reminders of them may help you feel more connected to them. You can be reminded of your partner’s importance in your life.


Hang up pictures of the two of you together around your home or at work. Make a picture of the two of you the wallpaper on your phone.
Exchange t-shirts. Having something of your partner's can reassure you and comfort you, especially if it's something like a t-shirt that they've worn and smells like them.

, Talk about your goals for the relationship after your separation ends. While you may be in a long distance relationship for just a few months or for many years, it may help you and your partner feel confident about the relationship if you have some mutually agreed-upon goals.While it may not be possible in every circumstance, knowing an end date to your time apart can be helpful in planning your next steps and strengthening your relationship.
It is good to have something concrete to look forward to when the separation obligations are over. Maybe you will be taking a next step in your relationship, like moving in together, or maybe you and your partner will be reunited and able to take a long vacation before resuming your day-to-day lives.
Express your dreams about what you would like to have happen when you are reunited. Even if you never fulfill these plans, it can distract your mind from the distance between the both of you and make you think of your future together. You could say, “When you get home, I want to spend a day in the city, walking around and having lunch at our favorite Indian place. What do you want to do?”

, One or both of you may get down about the pain of the separation. Be supportive and remind each other that the distance isn't forever. It might be a long way away, but the measure is only temporary, and you will eventually be together. Stay positive and loving toward each other.


You could say, “I know how much we miss each other, but it makes me happy that we care about each other so much. Talking to you every day really helps me feel better about our separation.”
Keep track of how many days you have until your separation is over. You could say, “just four more months until you’re home for good!” or “We’ll be seeing each other in two weeks, and then you’ve only got six months left of school!”

Create something for your special someone.,
Get support from your friends.,
Have a plan if you’re lonely.,
Live your life.,
Pursue your own interests.",How to Not Miss Your Partner in a Long Distance Relationship3," Getting creative and making something like a scrapbook or a photo collage can not only help you take your mind off things, it can also remind you of the good times you've both shared together. When your partner is feeling lonely, they can look at something that you have put the time and effort into and know how much they mean to you.


You don’t have to be crafty to make something for your partner. It is the thought that counts, and your partner will appreciate your efforts.
You could make a mixed CD of songs that are meaningful to your relationship.
If you like to bake, you could make cookies to send in the mail.


, Ask your friends to help you stay busy and avoid obsessing over your long-distance romance. Keep an active social life and fill your calendar with fun (and distracting) things to do.You could say to your friends, “Please let me know of anything you’re up to while Mark is deployed. I need to keep busy!”
Take the initiative and plan events for you and your friends. They don’t have to be anything big. You could say, “Do you want to order pizza and watch a movie with me tomorrow night?”

, You may realize that loneliness hits you at certain times--maybe when you are out with your married couple friends, or when you drive by places that hold happy memories with your partner. Come up with some ways to deal with your loneliness so you can be prepared when it strikes.You could call a friend and catch up with them.
Text your partner and let them know you are thinking about them. You could say, “I was just walking by the park where we had a picnic over the summer. That was a lovely day. Thinking of you!”
You could decide to exercise, clean your apartment, or read a book to take your mind off your loneliness.
Stay engaged with your friends and family. Make plans with them and do things that interest you.
Many people feel lonelier at night. If you happen to be one of them, consider creating a bedtime routine to help reduce anxiety and make you feel more peaceful. You could take a bath, read a book, and send a goodnight text before heading to bed.If the time zones are not too different, then you could even schedule a video chat with your partner to help reduce feelings of loneliness in the evening.

, Don’t put life on hold just because your partner isn’t there for it. Your partner wouldn’t want you to sit at home, pining for their return (if they do, you need to have a conversation about long distance relationship expectations). Time will move much faster if you are out and about instead of waiting by the computer to chat.Use the extra time you may have to better yourself. You could take up a new exercise program, take some classes, or learn a skill you’ve always wanted to have.
Be sure to engage with family and friends who are local as well.
Spend some extra time at school or at work, working to achieve some educational or professional goals.

, Even though you miss your partner, there are no doubt things that you enjoy doing without them around. Take advantage of their absence to pursue your interests that your partner doesn’t necessarily share.For example, you may be a big foodie, while your partner’s idea of exotic cuisine is the Chinese buffet. You could spend your time apart trying new restaurants.
You may love science fiction movies while your partner can’t stand them. Catch up on all the movies you want to see that might otherwise require negotiation.

Write an old-fashioned love letter to send by regular post.,
Send an email out of the blue.,
Make him the last person you talk to each night.",How to Make Your Long Distance Boyfriend Feel Special1," While you can send an email instantly, getting a package, or letter in the post is a much more intimate and a heartfelt effort. Letters also create a keepsake that just can’t happen via email.Don’t worry about writing the perfect poem or something profound, the fact that you made the effort to write is enough. You can draw a picture, find a heartfelt pre-made card or even send a postcard from a special place.
If you want to try to write something special, try telling the story of how the two of you met. Give him special details that create a bond that only you two share.;
, Keeping a long distance relationship special means making an extra effort, including sending an email just because instead of always replying to their emails. This can be as simple as a quick message to say they are on your mind or sending something funny.


Keep in mind you may not always get a reply right back, we can’t expect the other person to always be available but you can make an effort to send them an email they can read when they are.

, No matter how busy you each get, taking the time to set aside routines like ending every night with each other on the phone or video chat makes the other person know they are important. Make plans to make time every day for each other.

Consider what you want to say ahead of time.,
Be kind, but firm.,
Stick to the facts.,
Practice self-care.,
Seek help if you have trouble moving on.",How to Let Go of a Long Distance Relationship1," Pay attention to your gut instinct. Your relationship doesn’t have to be perfect, but it should have an overall positive effect on your life. If you have an unhealthy dynamic with your partner, or if you just have the nagging feeling that the relationship has run its course, it may be time to say goodbye.If your partner puts you down, gets jealous when you see your friends, or makes you do all the traveling when you visit each other, your relationship probably isn’t healthy.
Notice if you find yourself dreading visits or avoiding phone calls with your significant other.;
, If you live halfway around the world from your boyfriend or girlfriend, traveling to break up with them might not be practical or possible. However, it’s more respectful to break up with someone face-to-face, and saying goodbye in person will give you and your soon-to-be-ex a better sense of closure.The longer you’ve been with your long-distance partner, the more important it becomes that you break up with them in person.
If you can’t break up in person, have the conversation over the phone or a video call. Whatever you do, avoid breaking up by email or text.

, Think about why you want to break up, and decide how you’ll break the news to your boyfriend or girlfriend. If you’re worried about getting emotional or forgetting what you want to say, ask a friend to help you practice by role-playing the conversation with you., Tell your boyfriend or girlfriend why the relationship isn’t working out for you. Use “I” phrases instead of ""you,"" and avoid criticizing them or blaming them for your decision to break up.For instance, don’t say, “You don’t make enough of an effort to stay in touch.” Instead, say, “I feel lonely when we don’t talk for days.”

, Keep a cool head and avoid letting your emotions get the better of you, even if your boyfriend or girlfriend takes the breakup hard. If they try to talk you out of your decision, remind them again why your mind is made up. Don’t let the conversation turn into an argument.For example, you might say, ""Even though I really love you, the long distance aspect of our relationship doesn't provide the kind of connection I need and want from a relationship.""
Arguing might give your ex false hope that they can talk you into getting back together in the future. You might say, ""I know you don't feel the same way, but I am certain about my decision.""

, If you are the person being dumped, you may be overwhelmed by sadness, confusion, or rejection. If the other person has expressed a desire to end the relationship, you have no choice but to respect their wishes. Take this time to care for yourself and heal emotionally.If you can, take off a few days from work or school and visit family or friends to put yourself in a new environment. Do things that make you happy like shopping for a new outfit or watching your favorite movies.
Try writing in a journal to help express and sort out your feelings about the break up.

, If you have trouble coming to terms with the breakup, it might help to see a school counselor or therapist in your area. Sometimes, breakups are hard to move on from. You may need professional help to come up with ideas to keep yourself busy, or start afresh after ending a relationship.


At your first visit, you might explain, ""My long-distance girlfriend broke up with me. She wasn't a part of my everyday life here, but I still feel so empty and alone. I need help.""

Ship your package.",How to Make a Care Package for Your Boyfriend," It’s easy to get out of hand with buying gifts for someone you care about, so stay firm on your budget. Remember that the most meaningful items for your boyfriend will likely be those that are sentimental in nature, and that the effort behind your care package will mean a lot to him, too.


Make sure you factor in shipping costs to your budget. The heavier and bulkier your box is, the more expensive your shipping will be. You will also pay shipping costs based on how far the box needs to travel. You can get an estimate of what you’ll pay for shipping on your shipping company’s website.;
, If you want to get the gift to him on a certain day, pay attention to shipping dates. The closer to the deadline you ship it, the more expensive it will be or the less likely it is to get there on time.


During holidays, shipping companies and post offices will usually indicate a “ship by” date to help you determine when you should mail your package in order for it to arrive in time for the holiday. You can check with your preferred carrier to help you determine your shipping deadline.

, Make sure you know what you can and cannot send through the mail. If your boyfriend is in the military, he may be subject to additional regulations about what he can receive in the mail.


Make sure your package doesn’t include prohibited items, including weapons, explosives, and alcohol. Policies vary by shipping company, so do your research beforehand.Use extra caution if shipping overseas. Many countries have specific regulations about what can be sent through the mail. In general, sending perishable food (such as produce, meat, and dairy products) is subject to regulation and are best avoided.Specific country restrictions can be found here: http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/ab_toc.htm


, A good care package will include some necessities, some treats, and some sentimental reminders of home. Factor in the availability of goods at your boyfriend’s location. For example, if he is just in another part of the country at college, he probably has access to the same goods as you do, so you may want to focus your care package more on local treats and sentimental items. If he is deployed in a developing country, he will appreciate more necessities than sentimental items.


Remember to keep size and weight of all items in mind as you make your purchasing decisions.
Consider some special items if your boyfriend is on deployment. You may wish to consult some lists about what items servicemen and women want and need while on deployment. Some items you may want to send include powdered drink mix, individual packets of condiments (such as hot sauce), socks, batteries, or puzzle books., Buy things you know your boyfriend needs, appreciates, and will use first. You could ask him about products he uses frequently, or items he needs replacing, in order to get ideas about what you’d like to include in his care package.


You might want to find out about his preferred brands of toiletries or needed clothing items.
To save on shipping, you may want to consider buying travel size bottles of toiletries like shampoo, lotion, or shaving cream.

, You may want to add some lightweight treats he loves in your care package. Consider including his favorite snacks, candy or gum, a paperback book, or magazines.


You could ask your boyfriend if there are any treats he is craving from home that he can’t get where he is located. Purchase them and include them in your package.
You could include some of your favorite treats in the package, too, to make him think of you. Maybe he always teases you about how much you like strawberry gum, for example. You could include a package of it with a funny little note about it.

, Include a picture of you (or the both of you), a postcard from your hometown, a comic that reminds you of him, or even construction paper hearts with “I love you” written on them. These items can be as personal and unique as your relationship!


If he has any children, younger cousins, or nieces and nephews, he may appreciate receiving some drawings, letters, or pictures of them.
If he has a pet still at home, you could include a picture of his favorite dog or cat.

For example, if you are sending a Christmas care package, you could include a homemade ornament., If you want to maximize your budget, put your creative skills to good use to make your boyfriend something special. You could make him something useful or something sentimental. It can be as simple or as complicated as you wish, depending on your skill level and available time.


If you are handy with fabric, you could make your boyfriend a blanket. A fleece tie blanket doesn’t even require a sewing machine.
Create a scrapbook signed by all of his friends who miss him while he is away. Have his friends include small mementos, like ticket stubs or photos, in the scrapbook.
You could make him a CD of his favorite music.
Bake something. Bake a batch of your boyfriend’s favorite cookies, or another treat that will hold up in shipping. Make sure the food item you’re sending adheres to any rules at his residence. (For example, food with nuts might be prohibited at school.)

, Make sure you include a letter that expresses your feelings about him and lets him know how much he is in your thoughts. He will appreciate knowing how much he means to you.


Your letter could include your feelings as well as day-to-day events in your life.
You could even include letters from other friends and family in your package, particularly if he is not able to receive mail frequently.

, Get the smallest box you can that will safely ship all the items in your care package. Keep in mind that you may need to specially pack certain items to insure they don’t break or leak.


You can usually buy boxes at your post office or shipping company’s store. Some stores will pack your items for an additional fee. If you’ll be shipping to him often, it might make sense to keep packaging from any online orders you receive to reuse. You can ask friends and family to save theirs too.

, Make sure that nothing can spill or break inside the box. Secure the contents of the box so that they do not jostle around in transit.


If there is anything that is fragile, wrap it carefully with newspaper or bubble wrap. If you are sending a package to your boyfriend in a faraway country, he may appreciate the newspaper wrap to be able to read some of the news from back home!
If there is any liquid, put it in a small plastic bag and tape up the ends. That way if it breaks open, the whole package isn’t ruined.
Separate toiletries and foods. Secure soaps in separate plastic bags to avoid their odor contaminating the food. Put foods in their own, separate plastic bags as well.Stuff newspaper or filler material in the empty spaces in the boxes to prevent contents moving around.
Tape the box securely to prevent it from being opened during transit.

, Decorate the package if you want. Put colorful tissue paper in it. Tie ribbons around the gifts. Draw or write something on the outside of the box that way as soon as he picks up the package, he’ll know who it’s from!


Keep in mind that additional decorative material may add weight (and therefore, expense) to your shipping cost.
Make sure any decorations on the outside of the box don’t obscure addresses.

, There are plenty of shipping companies that will deliver your parcel, as well as the post office. Shipping through your post office will likely be the least expensive, and private shipping companies will be more expensive.


You may want to research several companies, as well as your post office, to find out how much it will cost to send a package. For example, you may want to call the company or go online to ask, “How much would it cost to send a six pound package from Chicago to Glasgow?”
You may also have to pay extra if the dimensions of the package are outside acceptable limits.If you want, get insurance on the package. It is usually fairly inexpensive.
Fill out a customs form if it is destined for somewhere outside of the country. You will get this form at your post office or at your shipping company. You need to list the contents of the package and the cost of the item on the form.Make sure that the mailing address is correct, and that your return address is visible.
If something included is perishable, make sure that that is indicated clearly on the outside of the package.

If there's, say, an anniversary or birthday coming up in a few weeks, you could begin keeping an eye out during regular shopping trips.Keep your eyes open each time you go out shopping. If you're, say, shopping with a friend, look for tiny souvenirs and treats your partner would like.
You may not know where to look for presents for someone. If you simply keep your eyes open over time, you'll find the right gifts organically.;

, If you want to send your significant other food, non-perishables are a good idea. You never know how long a package will take to arrive in the mail, so pick something that will not expire quickly. Candy that will not melt, as well as things that come in jars (like nuts and jams) are a great addition to a care package.This is especially important for very long distance relationships. If your significant other lives overseas, for example, non-perishables are a good idea.

, There are some things you may not be able to ship. For example, if there's a fast food restaurant your significant other loves, you can't really mail them fast food. However, you could get a gift card to that restaurant and send it in the mail.You can also send a gift card to somewhere like a supermarket. If you know there's something your significant other can buy at the supermarket that you can't send, you can write a note saying that's what the gift card is for. For example, you could write ""For chocolate ice cream"" on a note and tape it to a gift card for a supermarket chain.

, A great way to bond is to read the same book from a distance. If you're engrossed in a particular novel, send a copy for your significant other. You could even personalize the book by underlining your favorite parts, or leaving notes in the margins.If the two of you aren't big readers, you can also send a CD of a band you're listening to or a DVD of a movie you like.

, When you go out and spend money on yourself, save small mementos of your trip that remind you of your partner. If you, say, went to a concert of a band you both like, save the ticket. If you ate at the restaurant where the two of you first met, save something like a paper menu and send it to them.You could assemble these items in a small scrapbook to send.

If you love to draw or paint, make them a picture. You can, for example, paint a picture of the coffee shop where you first met.
Sewing projects can be fun. You can try to sew a small stuffed toy of your significant other's favorite animal, for example.

, Smell is strongly linked to memory. Sending your partner something around the house that has your distinct smell can help them savor memories of you.If there's a particular brand of shampoo, laundry detergent, or lotion you use, send a small tube of that.
If you have a nightshirt you wear frequently, you could send this as long as you're comfortable giving it up for a while. You could also send one of your pillowcases.

You could also decorate your own box.If you want to do something really cute, draw hearts on on the surface of your chosen box. In each heart, write something you love about your partner.

, In addition to decorating the outside of the box, decorate the inside. You could glue strips of attractive fabric along the inside of the box. You could make a photo collage on the bottom of the box. You could also draw on it, decorate it with stickers, or use stencils., Store heavier items on the bottom, so they don't crush smaller, more delicate items. Anything breakable should be wrapped in bubble wrap or something similar. You do not want anything to break on the journey.


If you're sending foods or drinks, make sure the packages are sealed carefully. You don't want anything to leak.
You may want to put liquid items in plastic bags just in case they break while shipping. This way, any spills will be contained.

, Once your package is decorated and packed, you can send it in the mail. Stop by your local post office to purchase proper stamps.


Check for an estimate of when the package will arrive. If you need it there by a certain date, you may have to pay for faster shipping.
It's a good idea to get a tracking number. This way, you can track the package's process online and give your partner an idea of when to look for it.

If you're worried about sitting around being downtrodden, pick a day on the calendar as your ""deadline."" Get out all the sadness or frustration, and choose to ""move on"" after this date.
Try to identify one thing every day that makes you feel happy. It could be a small bird landing on your windowsill, or someone giving you a compliment. Consider writing these down in your journal — a collection of these may help lead you toward healing.

, It’s common to feel lonely and isolated after ending a long-distance relationship. Reach out to your loved ones for emotional support and a sympathetic ear. Your friends and family can help build up your self-esteem and take your mind off your ex.You can ask a friend, “I’m having trouble letting go of my relationship. I know you have been through this before. How did you get over the loss of your long-distance relationship?”
Or you might find that you just want to spend time with people you enjoy and who make you happy and not discuss your ex. Remember that it's your choice.

, Breakups have been a source of artistic inspiration for thousands of years. You don’t have to be a professional artist to appreciate the benefits of venting your feelings creatively. Writing, drawing, dance, and other forms of expression can help you channel your emotions constructively, and you might even pick up a new hobby along the way., If you find yourself feeling guilty about the breakup or wondering if you did the right thing, revisit your reasons for ending the relationship in the first place.

Delete your ex’s number from your phone and block or unfollow them on social media.Now isn’t the time to try to be friends with your ex. You may be able to reconnect eventually, but for the time being, give yourself at least six months to heal and move on.

, Sticking to a familiar schedule can help you feel as normal as possible, which will lead to a faster recovery. Instead of wallowing in sadness and adopting unhealthy habits, do your best to keep your sleep hours regular, stay productive at school or work, and maintain any other habits you had before the breakup.If part of your regular routine was talking to your ex at a certain time, you'll want to find something to do instead. Try calling a close friend or making that the time when you go practice your pottery skills.

Instead of slacking off at the gym and indulging in treats, take the opportunity to care for your health by choosing nutritious foods and challenging yourself during your workouts.Mood swings are exactly what you don’t need after a breakup, so avoid sugary foods.

Using your time productively will help you avoid moping about your ex, and new activities are a great way to make new friends., Spending time with friends is a tried-and-true way to get over an ex. Seek out new friendship with interesting people and strengthen existing bonds. Make plans to get together with people in your social circle and play a game, see a movie, or visit a new restaurant.


Reach out to one of your friends and say, ""I've been thinking about signing up for a Zumba class. It looks like such fun! You want to join me?""If you want to expand your group of friends, pursuing new hobbies is a good way to meet people with similar interests as you.

You’ll be more likely to repeat what worked, and less likely to make the same mistakes again.You might find that the relationship itself was the problem, or you may realize that long distance relationships don't work for you. Or, you might even become clearer about what kinds of ""ground rules"" you would need in a relationship that had some long distance components in it.

Be positive.",How to Maintain a Positive Long Distance Relationship," This is very important. Making him /her feel like he / she is the most spectacular thing that has ever happened to you is one of the most important things you can do.;
, With a long distance relationship, get used to being on the phone/computer for hours. It is your only way of connection to your significant other, therefore a vital part. Be able to talk about ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. This could range from things you did as a kid, to past relationships you've had, all the way up to your best-kept secrets. It is important to talk about your childhood because it's something that everyone can relate to. Everybody did things that were special to them when they were young, and it is a good thing to talk about. People are comfortable talking about their childhood adventures, friends, and materialistic things. It is also important to talk about past relationships you have had. This might be a little bit of a touchy thing, but we all know that we want to know if our significant other has any dirty secrets we want to know about. Let him / her know the names of your old partners, how old you were at the time you dated, and if you still maintain a friendship with them now. He / She will be more comfortable knowing this. Your secrets are also very important. Make him / her feel like he / she knows you almost, if not better than you do yourself.

, Defy the distance. Frequent communication is a great thing when it can be managed in a long distance relationship. However, constant communication over the phone alone may tend to drag people down in the long run. It's important to do other things together besides the usual phone call. Just think... people in short-distance relationships do not spend the majority of their time talking, but rather doing things with each other. Try to replicate this by finding things to do together such as watching a TV show or movie simultaneously. For an extensive list of more things you can do with each other (or for each other) click here: , This doesn't mean to go out and spend your life savings on flashy jewelry or expensive gadgets. Little gift packages, sent at random times will brighten their day and make them happy. If he / she likes candy, randomly send them a package of candy with a little love note inside. If you are an artist, sketch a picture of you two together and send it. Make a slide show of pictures that you have taken together and send it via media mail. Obviously, expect your wallet to get a bit lighter around their birthday and Valentine's Day, or other holidays. But if you are in this for marriage or the long haul, they will probably prefer you save money for your future, rather than blow it all on jewelry. So be wise in your gift decisions.

, Nothing would mean more to you than to see him / her, and them to see you. Always have a next visit planned, however difficult it may be. Many people in long-distance relationships feel that it is unbelievably difficult to go for long periods of time without seeing their significant other. This is true, but the way I think of it, is that any amount of time is worth waiting for the person you love.

, When you do visit, or vice versa, although you want to use a lot of your time to be together, it is very important (if you are living at home, or are a teenager) for your parents and family to get to know your significant other. Most families think long-distance relationships are a little unhealthy. I will tell you why. You are denying yourself the constant physical being with that person, and you spend all the time you have on talking, thinking about, or planning to see the person. This takes away time from your friends, family, and being social at all. Carefully construct times with your significant other of when you will talk. Maybe only talk during the day on Friday and Saturday and go out with your friends at night. This will help you maintain your friendships, while also maintaining your relationship (obviously, if you would not want them to drink/smoke with you not there, don't do it yourself).

, Staying positive and not focusing on the negative aspects of a LDR is essential to keeping your relationship blooming and your partner content. Being away from your sweetie is not all bad news. Use the opportunity of personal time to pursue your interests and hobbies as well as your career objectives. Another positive points it that long distance dating pushes both of you to be more creative, communicate better since you don't have ""face-to-face"" time and test your feelings. As long as you see the long distance relationship as a temporary state, you will keep your chin up and transmit that feeling of security and happiness to your partner too.

Obviously different money issues might impact on the amount you can spend on them, but that's not saying you can't try to chip in a bit too! If you're the one who suffers with the agonizing bills then perhaps you should ask your partner if it would be possible for them to ring or book tickets next time.;
, Most phone contracts offer a certain amount of minutes and texts, so work out how many you have to use a day. Once you have worked it out, be strict with yourself, its okay to go over your daily budget every now and then, but try not to use too many minutes or texts each day as they will add up and make a bigger bill for you.

, The two of you can’t meet up on Fridays or Saturdays to see a movie or go to the park, but you can still have date night. Be sure to download a video call application such as Skype or Google Hangouts. These applications allow you to see your date in real-time, so you can pretty much do whatever you’d do on a regular date via a video call.One suggestion might include ordering takeout meals or cooking a meal and then eating at the same time by candlelight. Do whatever you two would normally do on a date night over the call.

, Distance can make the heart grow fonder, especially when you spice things up every now and then. A great way to keep your LDR smoking hot is to tend to your intimacy needs. You can send flirty pictures of yourself blowing kisses in sexy poses or send a teasing message telling your date how you’ve been thinking about him or her all day. Do what feels comfortable to you and your partner., Imagine how it will brighten your special someone’s day to receive a package in the mail from you. Of course, shipping can be expensive on large items, so be creative and do something that fits your budget.Examples of nifty gifts can be a handwritten love letter, a funny card, a framed photograph of you, some home-baked cookies, or a new CD. Consider what your date really likes and send a little something that says “I’m thinking of you.”
It may even be a sign of a commitment if each of you gifts a personal item for the other to keep for a time. This might include a special shirt or an inexpensive piece of jewelry.

, Keeping the spark alive can also extend to your online profiles. Even if the two of you aren't together everyday, it can make things even more exciting to demonstrate your commitment to the world. You can set your statuses as ""in a relationship"" or share cute picture of your partner on your Facebook or Instagram pages.


Be forewarned, social media can be a great way to express your affection for your long-distance love.Unfortunately, it can also be a source of tension. Set boundaries with your partner about what both of you expect on social media.
Since each of you are likely to spend more time with friends than each other, your expectations need to be clear to minimize jealousy after your partner posts photos of him/herself at a wild party.

, No matter which method you choose, strive to make contact with your love at least once a day. You can communicate in a ton of ways—via email, texts, video calls, social media, or traditional phone calls.


Keep in mind, this doesn’t mean you have to stay connected all day, every day. Doing this can manifest into dependency and/or depression because no matter how often you talk you still can’t be there physically.Simply decide on an agreeable amount of contact that works with both your schedules.

, Feeling like you are actually in a relationship comes down to keeping each other abreast to what’s going on in your separate lives. Don’t just tell your immediate family or close friends about your exciting new job or the funny thing that happened to you at the coffee shop, tell your long-distance partner, too.


Be sure to keep the details you share reasonable. For example, it may be unnecessary and creepy to share what you eat at each meal or what you are doing every hour on the hour.No matter how often you talk to your partner, you will still miss out on certain things going on in his or her life. That's okay. This doesn't have to take away from the excitement. In fact, mystery can sometimes make things more exciting. Just be sure to keep one another abreast of the important things.

, Routine can be just as refreshing as spontaneity when it’s exercised on the things that count. Come up with some way to reach out to each other that works for you both and stick to it. This gives you both something to look forward to each day and also allows you to maintain some consistency in your otherwise nontraditional relationship.


For instance, maybe you two send silly pictures every morning when you wake. Or, you might commit to talking to one another each night before you go to bed.

, Sharing how you would love to go to this restaurant or that event with your partner lets him or her know that you long for time together. This also emphasizes that you are interested in exploring the world with this person. Saying something like ""I really miss you and can't wait until next weekend when I get to see you"" is perfectly okay. However, be sure to avoid pitfalls that could cause your partner to feel guilty.

For example, it may not be a good idea to guilt-trip him or her by saying something like ""I hate that you're always gone. We never get to do anything together."" This comes off as complaining. Your partner likely wouldn't be long-distance if he or she had a choice, so refrain from throwing the situation in his or her face. This will likely ruin the excitement of your long-distance relationship.

, Play is important for all romantic couples because it strengthens your bond and improves relationship satisfaction.

You will certainly think fondly of your partner if, most of the time, when you are connecting it is while doing engaging things together.

Games can come in all different varieties. You can play a questions game in which you both answer silly questions about yourselves. You can also both download games on your cell phones to play against one another. Another option is to play against one another on a gaming device, such as a Playstation.

, Choose a time when both of you are free and plan to watch an interesting movie, TV show, or documentary. If you don’t have much time, you can even share funny YouTube videos with each other to watch for a laugh.

, At some point or another, being in a long-distance relationship may feel stressful if the two of you don’t know where you are going. Relationship experts often suggest coming up with a goal for when the two of you will be able to live closer together.In the meantime while you wait for this “someday”, you can discuss your dreams together.


Talk about how you want to live in the future, describing what your homes will look like. Talk about an ideal vacation. Discuss how many kids you each want (if any) and your dream careers.

, Either way, be clear about your desires, needs or confusions. NEVER string someone along or cheat just because distance makes this easier or tempting. Your partner won't be able to tell how you are feeling as easily, so you will need to tell them and communicate openly and frequently.

, The less you expect, the less will be the problems. But keep expecting love or that'll no longer be a ""relationship""

, So either avoid or stop in the middle of the argument or the best thing, let your partner win. This will in turn strengthen your relationship.

Make plans to see each other.,
Keep the love alive.",How to Have a Long Distance Relationship," The thing you are lacking is physical contact, so the strongest need is communication. Make that a number one priority. Talk regularly to keep each other advised of the happenings in one another's lives. Set aside time for loving conversation and time for conversation about basic things that need to be discussed, such as home arrangements or administrative things. Try to always fit in time for loving discussions, and not let your sadness or annoyance at being apart take the upper hand of every talk together. Understand that you live in different areas and that you might not see each other often, so don't make it a main point every time you talk. It's a fact and acceptance is part of it.


Keep in contact with your partner not just through text. Use Skype, video chats and even snail mail. And don't forget the beauty of a poem or a story featuring your loved one now and then! You could even send letters or care packages.
There may be awkward silences, but remember what matters; in time, a little silence here and there may actually become a part of your normal routine as you just listen to each other breathe.;
, You may want to tell him or her how horrible your day was and you can but try to listen to the them more. Realize when you're making the conversation too much about you and not enough about them.

, Sometimes in a relationship there may be a period when both people are busy with school or work and may not be as quick to reply as they normally would. Try not to get angry or worried within the first week if the person doesn't reply to your message. You have to understand they might not be able to reply given their current situation.

Make video chatting a priority.,
Go on a movie date.,
Schedule weekly meals together.,
Make surprise visits to each other.",How to Keep the Passion in a Long Distance Relationship2," Many people use text messaging as a primary source of communication. However, this is not the best way to keep the passion and intimacy strong in your relationship. Choose a few times throughout the week to get together and video chat.Video chatting allows you both to see each other’s face, which is important when trying to maintain passion.
During video chat, you can have a smooth, immediate conversation, which you can’t do on text. Video chat allows you to watch each other’s facial expressions, unlike talking on the phone.

, Being unable to have regular date night can be tough when you’re in a long distance relationship. To help, go on a movie date together. Choose a favorite movie or a movie you’ve both never seen. Curl up on the couch and watch the movie together.You can do this while talking on the phone, texting, or video chatting.

Keep your partner updated with your plans.,
Ask questions about their life.,
Communicate with them daily.,
Send mail to each other.",How to Keep the Passion in a Long Distance Relationship3," It’s easy to feel left out when your partner is somewhere else, living a life you can’t be part of. You and your partner will have friends and experiences the other can’t be part of. To help keep them feel included and connected, send them texts and photos throughout your night so they know you are thinking of them and can almost feel like they’re there.This is especially important if you are posting photos to Instagram, Snapchat, or other social media. If you have time to update social media, you have time to send a text to your partner.
Send a special photo you haven’t posted on social media, and include a message like, “I miss you” or “Wish you were here with me!”

, Unless you tell your partner what you are doing, they won’t know. To help keep them in your life, let them know where you are going and who you are with. This helps keep the intimacy and passion between you because you both are including each other in your lives.For example, you might text them and say, “Going out with my friends to this really cool bar. They have a band I know you’d love! We’ll go next time you visit.” You may consider calling them afterwards and telling them about your night. Or, if you are attending an event, such as a concert, then you might consider using services like Facebook or Skype to share live video with them.
Do not think about this as a way for your partner to keep tabs on you. You are sharing your lives with one another, just like you would be if you lived in the same area. This is a way to keep each other involved in both your lives.

, It can be easy to slip into the habit of just texting about your day and expecting your partner to do the same. Help keep the passion by asking questions about your partner’s life, being interested in their new experiences, and remembering things they have going on.For example, you may text, “How is your job going?” or “Are you still liking your apartment?” You might say, “I remember you had a conflict with someone at work. How is that going?” or “Have you tried the new Indian restaurant you mentioned a few weeks ago?”

, Keeping in touch with your significant other is important because it show that you are thinking about them. When in a long distance relationship, you should text or call each other every day, even if it’s just to say hello and talk about your day.

Brush your teeth.,
Use mouthwash.,
Have breath mints or gum on hand.,
Use chapstick or lip gloss.",How to Deal With Common Kissing Issues1," One of the best and healthiest ways to avoid a kissing disaster is to brush your teeth. No one wants to kiss someone who still has food particles in between their teeth or has bad breath.


Don’t forget to brush your tongue as well. Bacteria can build up on your tongue if it’s not brushed regularly, which causes bad breath.Get in the habit of bringing a travel size toothbrush and toothpaste with you. You can either keep it in the car or, for girls, in your purse. Having the essentials on hand will help you to be prepared at all times.
There are also disposable products you can purchase, which slip on your finger and serve as a toothbrush. These are a bit more discreet and don’t require you to have toothpaste on hand. You can find them at any major retail store or online at sites such as Amazon.;
, Once you’re done brushing, don’t forget to finish with some mouthwash. It not only helps to fight bacteria, but will freshen your breath and make you even more kissable.Mouthwash shouldn’t be used as a substitute for brushing. However, if you’ve brushed recently and are just in need of a freshening, feel free to swish with some mouthwash.
To use mouthwash properly, swish it around in your mouth for a full 30 seconds. If 30 seconds is too long, try to keep it in your mouth for as long as you can before it begins to burn.Travel size mouthwash is also something you can have on hand for emergencies. This is particularly useful if you think you may be staying overnight but don’t want to be presumptuous.

, In case you’re on the go and haven’t had time to adequately brush your teeth, breath mints and gum are an easy way to mask your bad breath. They also come in handy if your date has bad breath too!


Gum is actually beneficial in more ways than one, as it helps with saliva production. This may not seem like a good thing, but saliva production is actually a defense against bad breath.If you’re wondering what type of gum or mint is best, opt for cinnamon as it helps to reduce bacteria in your mouth.

, Another way to make your mouth more kissable and fresh is to apply chapstick or lip gloss. If you’re nervous, instead of licking your lips, try applying chapstick or gloss so that you don’t dry out your lips.


If you’re applying lip gloss, don’t wear anything that is too sticky. Instead, consider buying a flavored lip gloss that isn’t overly heavy.
Lip balm is another great product, which will make your lips softer and smoother and even more kissable."
"
Watch for more eye contact.,
Look for an increase in physical contact.,
Watch for them to lean in.",How to Deal With Common Kissing Issues2," It’s often a good sign that someone is into you or wants to kiss you if you notice an increase in eye contact. They may stare into your eyes or glance at you and nervously look away.


Eye contact increases intimacy as well, so don’t be surprised if you feel your heart flutter or your palms get sweaty as a result of the increased eye contact.The person doesn’t have to stare deep into your eyes to want to kiss you. They may feel equally nervous and may continue to look at you before quickly glancing away. Try to lock eyes with them and give them a reassuring smile if that’s the case. This will help them to feel more comfortable.

, In addition to increased eye contact, you may also notice an increase in physical contact. Whether it’s holding your hand or brushing up against you, physical contact can be a good indication of someone’s desire to kiss you.


They may be discrete in their intentions, by asking to show you something on their phone or by requesting a hug. Chances are they are just trying to get you to move closer, so take the hint and cozy up with them.

, One of the best indications that someone wants to kiss you is if they lean in. If you’re on the receiving end and share their feelings, lean in towards them to initiate the kiss. If you’re the one trying to lean in for a kiss, make sure to time it right so that you don’t catch them off guard.


Leaning in during a meal is probably not the best time to initiate a kiss, particularly if it’s a first date.Wait until the person is paying attention to lean in. Even better, wait until you notice that increase in eye contact and physical contact before going for it.

Steer clear of braces.,
Keep your neck from cramping.,
Deal with a bad kisser.,
Be confident.",How to Deal With Common Kissing Issues3," If you’re young, chances are you may be dealing with braces. You shouldn’t avoid kissing someone with braces, but if they’ve just gotten them, it’s best to steer clear until they’ve had time to heal.


When you do go in for the kiss, go slowly. The last thing you want to do is to come in fast and get stuck if you’re both wearing braces.Steer clear of braces with your tongue. While you can still enjoy the pleasure of using your tongue during kissing, you should avoid rubbing your teeth over braces. This could result in an injury, which would be awkward for both parties involved.

, Regardless of your age, kissing can be physically demanding. This is particularly true if your partner isn’t the same height as you, which could result in a sore neck from straining to get to their level.


If you are shorter than your partner, try wearing heels or sitting on a bar stool. If you are taller, try leaning against a wall and have your partner stand between your legs to get on even footing.

, At some point in your life, you’ll inevitably encounter someone who is less experienced than you at kissing. Luckily, most bad kissers can become good kissers with a little bit of patience and encouragement.


Show your partner what you consider to be good kissing. When the other person starts to follow your lead, respond positively and obviously so that he or she knows you like it.
Never criticize someone’s kissing style. Instead, ask them to try something different with you and show them the way you like to be kissed., One of the most important things to remember is that confidence goes a long way when it comes to kissing. If you feel self-conscious you may act unnatural, which could result in an awkward kiss or no kiss at all.

Begin a tender moment with your significant other.,
Move your face closer to your significant other's.,
Move your eyes closer together.,
Flutter your eyelashes.,
Flutter your eyelashes even faster.",How to Butterfly Kiss," The butterfly kiss works best if you two are lying down, sitting next to each other in a comfortable and private setting, or just feeling close to one another. A butterfly kiss is best done in private, when you're both relaxed, and you should be cuddling, snuggling, or touching each other a bit first. It's a little hard to go from zero to butterfly kiss, and you don't want to catch your partner by surprise.


This is the kind of kiss you should try with someone you've been with for a while. Though it's not particularly sexual, the butterfly kiss is very intimate, and you don't want to shock someone you've only been dating for a few weeks with this tender gesture.
If you're really comfortable with your partner, then you can even talk about the butterfly kiss in advance. Your partner may be a little caught off guard when you try to lock eyes instead of lips. But a butterfly kiss can be a wonderful surprise, too!;
, Slowly start to move toward them. You can even start with a short, but meaningful kiss on the lips or the cheeks. It's perfectly normal to butterfly kiss at the beginning, middle, or end of a regular kissing session. As you get closer, you can give your partner a light touch, too. Bringing your bodies closer together, not just your faces, will add an intimate effect for the butterfly kiss.

, You can try to bring your faces together so that both of your eyes line up, though this may be more challenging because your noses will get in the way. You can also just move your right eye closer to your partner's right eye or your left eye closer to your partner's left eye. Move slowly, so the motion is gentle and effortless.

, Begin to blink, a bit rapidly, for your eyelashes to truly flutter. Your eyelashes will touch your partner's eyelid and the area around their eyes, including their eyelashes. Your partner may even get the picture and will start fluttering their eyelashes, too. You'll be feeling like you're inside a butterfly garden before you know it!

, Beat those wings like you've got places to fly! Try moving your eyelashes even faster by blinking more rapidly to increase the effect you're going for. You can even mix it up, going between blinking really fast and slowing down those flutters. Butterfly kisses can last just a few seconds, though, so you don't have to overthink it too much. But if you really do like butterfly kissing, you can be at it for a minute or more!


Some people even give butterfly kisses on the cheek, or other tender parts of their significant other's face. This also creates a tender feeling that is hard to replicate! The next time you and your partner are lying down or cuddling, you can try this tender gesture.

Make her happy.,
Catch her in the mood.,
Get her alone.",How to Get a Girl to Kiss You1," Even if she isn't your girl just yet, do something to thrill her. The smallest of things can win her over.


Surprise her. Nobody's talking diamonds here. Flowers, her favorite food, a new CD, anything. She'll be likely to show her gratitude physically.
Do something for her. Has she been complaining about wanting new headphones? Did she miss biology class and needs the notes? Take the time to listen and find opportunities to help her out.;
, Odds are you'll be able to tell when she's feeling kissable. Take in her appearance and behavior and gauge what mood she's in.


If she's calm and flirty, she's there. Note if she's touching you and smiling. Make sure you have her attention and she's not distracted.
If she's loud and all over the place, she's probably not feeling very romantic. She may be caught up in her day or excited about something else.

, Most people aren't comfortable with displays of affection, especially if it's the first kiss. What's more, it should be cozy and intimate. Take her somewhere you won't be interrupted and you can focus on each other.

If you expect the moment, pop a mint or chew some gum beforehand.

, She needs to know that you're into her and would welcome her kiss. Make it clear that you would not turn her down--girls get just as nervous about rejection as guys, if not more.


Depending on your relationship, touch her lightly. This could be on her arm, hands, or leg. If you have the opportunity, throw your arm around her and keep her close.
Don't rush. If the relationship is new, take it slow. Good things come to those who wait, after all. She may feel the need to trust you first.

, She needs not to only feel physically comfortable with you, but emotionally comfortable, too. Let her know you want her, not her body.


Insinuate how special she is to you. A compliment can get you a long, long way. You may not want to say this outright--she may not know what to say back. Stick to something like, ""I've been wanting to take you here for a really long time. This moment is perfect,"" to get your point across.
Girls can get kissy if you show them you care. If she's going through a hard time, tell her you want to listen and then do it. Grab her in a romantic hug and take advantage of the moment.

If she's not reciprocating, it's not the right moment. Be patient. It may have nothing to do with you.

, If you're in the middle of an action movie and she's so entranced the popcorn is missing her mouth, it's not the right time. Use your own senses of whether or not to get close and personal.

Get close to your partner.,
Touch noses.,
Shake your head from side to side as if you're saying ""No.""",How to Do an Eskimo Kiss1," You will need to be very close so that your faces can touch. This is a fun way to show affection if you are already close to one another, like if you are cuddling on the couch or holding each other close.;
, Touch the tip of your nose to the tip of your partner's nose. You can leave your eyes open or closed; do whichever feels more comfortable.

It's not done instead of kissing, and in fact is not meant to be romantic at all. In some cultures, it is only done between mothers and children.You will need to stand very close to your partner. If you are a mother sharing a kunik with your child, you may want to pick him or her up or squat down to his or her level.

, The nose, cheeks, and forehead are all common spots to nuzzle.Imagine you partner is wrapped up tight against the cold, probably wearing a hood and a scarf. You would rub your nose over the skin that is still exposed and not bundled up.

It is possible this type of greeting dates back to when language was not very evolved, and we relied more on our senses--like smell--to identify, communicate, and connect with others."

Talk about what is acceptable and not acceptable in the relationship.,
Discuss how often you will communicate with each other.,
Commit to trusting each other.,
Discuss a feasible deadline.",How to Establish a Long Distance Relationship1," Long-distance relationships come with a variety of challenges. One of the biggest is temptation. Establish with your partner at the beginning of the coupledom what you will and won’t tolerate, to avoid any question later on.


For instance, decide if seeing other people or going on dates with others is something you’re comfortable with. Make your feelings about this well-known if you decide to pursue a long- distance relationship. If you don’t, you may end up with a broken heart.Remember that it is not all or nothing. You might consider a lead in period of dating others, and set a date in the future after which you will not date other people.;
, If you’re like many, not hearing from your significant other for a few weeks is going to create some friction. However, hearing from them constantly throughout the day can create the idea that trust is lacking. Decide from the start how often you want to communicate with each other, and stick to that commitment.


For instance, you can set a rule that you should text each other each day to check in and you must speak on the phone at least twice a week. Deciding these rules now can prevent you from getting hurt or hurting your partner by making it seem like they aren’t a priority., Long-distance relationships are built on trust. You have to be able to trust the person in order to make it work. If you constantly feel like you are defending yourself or are being questioned about your intentions, or vice versa, you likely aren’t going to have a lasting relationship.


Make a rule that you are going to trust each other 100 percent. Decide that you are going to take the person’s word for it, and you’re not going to get insecure about how the other person feels. You may not be ready to handle a long-distance relationship if you can’t stick to these guidelines., Chances are you don’t want to stay in a long-distance relationship for the rest of your life. Decide how long you are going to be apart from the beginning. Having an end goal of living near each other can give you hope when you’re feeling unsure.


For instance, you can decide that you are going to move to where your partner lives after a year. Or, you could make a plan that if you are still going strong after six months, one of you is going to relocate."
"
Use technology to see other often.,
Do things together virtually.,
Plan visits as often as you can.,
Do similar things together.",How to Establish a Long Distance Relationship2," There’s only so much that can happen over texting or talking over the phone. People in relationships want to see each other and if they can’t, they may forget why they entered the coupledom in the first place. Fortunately, you can use technology to see the face of your significant other, just about whenever you want.


Certain apps and services like Skype and Facebook Messenger allow you to video-conference on your phone or computer. Make use of these as often as you can to feel connected., Engaging in virtual activities together makes it seem like you are in a close-distance relationship and allows you to have fun as a couple. What you choose to do will together will depend on your individual interests. There are playful options to fit any couple's quirks.


For example, go online and play a computer game together, or get matching video game systems and compete together there. You can also play games against each other on your phone.You might also watch movies or TV shows together or learn a skill like computer-coding.

, Couples need some kind of physical interaction and you can’t get that unless you see each other in person. Simply holding hands or sharing a meal together can make a huge difference in your relationship and keep that spark going strong. Stay committed to seeing each other as often as you can.


For instance, make standing “dates” with each other, whether it’s every weekend, every two weeks, or once a month. Your long-distance relationship may not be feasible if you aren’t able to see each other regularly. You may need to reconsider your situation if you can’t meet each other’s needs., Part of being a couple is sharing and engaging in interests together. Doing so gives you something to talk about and helps you learn about each other.


For instance, you can decide to start reading the same book at the same time and have a book club of sorts. You can start the same exercise program or diet together, or you can watch a movie at the same time you are talking on the phone."
"
Forget what a “typical” relationship is supposed to look like.,
Send each other gifts, just because.,
Show up to functions that really matter.",How to Establish a Long Distance Relationship3," If you worry that your relationship doesn’t fit the mold, stop. Going in thinking it’s not going to work will put a damper on the relationship from the start. Stop worrying about what’s happening and just do what feels right.


You may need to tell your friends and family to butt out if they regularly make you question your relationship. You could politely say, “I understand you are looking out for me, but your constant criticisms about my relationship just aren’t working for me. I’d appreciate it if we didn’t talk about my love life.”, Part of the excitement of a relationship is doing things for each other simply out of love. You and your partner don’t need to miss out on this just because you’re in a long-distance relationship. You can give each other tokens of your affection, even if you don’t live near each other.


For example, you can send the other person flowers, have a bottle of wine sent to the table you know they’re eating at, and write a letter professing your feelings. Taking the time to focus on little things like this can have a positive effect on the relationship in a big way.Long distance relationships may bring challenges, but there are also rewards. You can build up a great set of relationship-building skills and mutual understanding through the relationship.

, Try not to use your distance as an excuse to not attend events that really matter to the other person. Being there when they need you, or surprising them by showing up, can really give the person an idea of just how committed you are and how much you mean to them.


Deaths in the family, birthdays, holidays, and promotions are all big life events. It would mean the world to your partner if you could find a way to make it to some of these events."
"
Guide your partner.,
Focus on the lips.,
Kiss a lot.,
Keep your mouth opened only a little.,
Restart the kiss.,
Try not to use too much saliva when you kiss.",How to Deal With a Sloppy Kiss1," Some sloppy kissers suck too hard on your tongue and others open their mouths too wide. However, it’s possible to fix a sloppy kisser and avoid another sloppy kiss.


Do this by taking the lead and showing your partner how you want to kiss. The key here is that you need to become the dominant kisser, at least for a time. If your partner is sucking too hard on your tongue, pull your tongue back, but do it gently.
Then, just start kissing the other person again but with lighter kisses. After you’ve kissed softly for a little bit, your partner will probably just naturally take your lead. Kiss your partner the way in which you want to be kissed back.;
, One reason for sloppy kisses is that there is too much tongue movement going on. You can encourage the other person to focus on the lips and not the tongue.


Do this by focusing on your partner's lips yourself, by sucking them and kissing them. Do this gently.
Hopefully, the other person will start kissing you back the same way. It’s the excess saliva produced by tongue kissing that can make kissing seem sloppy.

, When people are just getting acquainted, it can take time to figure out what the other person likes and to adjust to his or her kissing style.


You will need to practice kissing your partner a lot before you two settle into your own personal dance. That’s a good word for it, too. Each couple has to figure out what works best for both of you.
So, don’t give up fast. Just keep kissing your partner. Try to guide your partner toward better kissing early on, though. You don’t want to mislead the other person into thinking the kissing is working out great because then it will become the routine.

, One thing that causes sloppy kissing is that the other person has the mouth open too widely.


You can encourage your partner not to do this by keeping your own mouth closed a little bit more.
You don’t want to do this in a way that seems standoffish, but your partner will likely mirror you.

, If your partner is getting saliva all over you, that’s no fun. It’s best to start the kiss over than to let a really sloppy kiss continue.


Take a small step back to restart the kiss, take your partner’s face in both hands, stare into the other person's eyes, and say something endearing. Then restart the kiss with the mouth opened less. Take the lead on restarting the kiss, so that you can set the pace and the tone. You could break up the first kiss by nibbling on your partner’s neck or ear lobe, so it’s not so obvious why you’re doing it.

, Too much saliva on the face is the hallmark of a sloppy kiss! Try to avoid it. Too much saliva usually means the kisser had a wide open mouth or was kissing too forcefully.


Maybe you're the sloppy kisser? Or you're wondering if you could be? It's important to understand the parts of a sloppy kiss that the receiver does not enjoy. That's often too much saliva.
People usually consider a kiss sloppy when it leaves saliva on your face, especially outside of your lips. If you or your significant other has to wipe their face or has drool on it, the kiss is probably too sloppy.
You probably won't cause too hard of feelings if you say something like, ""let's kiss so we don't get each other's faces so wet!"" in a playful manner.

"

Tell your partner directly what you don't like.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Talk about kissing.,
Show patience.,
Embrace the sloppy kisses.",How to Deal With a Sloppy Kiss2," Communication is very important in relationships, so there's no need to beat around the bush. You could just be forthright and honest.


You want to spare your partner's feelings, so it's best to start by trying to fix a sloppy kisser with positive and subtle encouragement. However, if this doesn't work, your partner should respect your honesty, and it's time to be more direct.
Telling your partner what you do like can be the best way to direct the other person to stop doing what you don't like. However, there may come a time that you need to say something like, ""I prefer gentle kissing. Is it OK if we try kissing that way?"" Be kind but direct.

, When your partner kisses you in a way that you like, let your partner know. Say things like, “I really love it when you kiss me in this way.”


It’s better to express what you like than to tell your partner what you don’t like because people can get very sensitive about how they kiss.
If your partner is kissing you in a way you don’t like, simply start kissing the other person the way you prefer, but then use positive verbal reinforcement after a few minutes of it to encourage the better way of kissing.

, You could just cut to the chase and tell your partner exactly where and how you want to be kissed. If you do this in a sensual, loving way, it could actually turn your partner on!


Say something like, “I love it most when you kiss me gently” or however you prefer to be kissed.
You could back up and ask your partner to kiss you in a specific way. Being verbal is OK. It’s better to express how you feel than to hold it in and not enjoy the kiss., Don’t immediately dump a person just because they’re a sloppy kisser. You could be giving up a good thing!


A lot of people think they are good kissers and don’t realize they are sloppy. Maybe the last person they kissed preferred the way they are kissing you (as hard as that might be to imagine). Research has shown that some people judge a relationship by the first kiss. This can be a mistake.It takes time to get to know a new partner and to understood their likes and dislikes and the nuances that make a connection work. Give it time, and remember that communication is important.

, There are actually biological reasons for sloppy kissing. Research has found that men are more likely to use sloppy kisses.


Men’s saliva has testosterone in it. Thus, it’s been shown to raise a partner's libido! It might improve your sex life to embrace it! Kissing also has other chemical benefits. It activates the release of dopamine, which makes people feel good, and it can activate release of oxytocin, which creates feelings of attachment.

"
"
Use a question game.,
Refer to a magazine.,
Play the mirror game.",How to Deal With a Sloppy Kiss3," You could turn the kissing problem into a fun game to camouflage that you’re really trying to change the way your partner kisses.


Ask questions such as, “How do you like being kissed best?” Or “what’s your favorite way to kiss?” And then describe your own answers.The goal here is not to seem critical, but rather to make it clear you’re asking the questions to try to learn more about each other. It works both ways. Maybe there’s something your partner wishes you would change when it comes to kissing too. This will help you learn that!

, You could tell your partner that you read in a magazine about a new way of kissing and ask if you can try it.


Make it sound like it’s a fun experiment or adventure. Say something like, “In the magazine, they mention that you should try to kiss gently, and without using too much tongue. It might be fun to try that.”
Keep it lighthearted, and tell your partner that you read this in a women’s or men's magazine. Don’t make it sound like you were seeking out the information, though., In this game, you mirror how each other kisses. Don’t be critical, just suggest playing the game because it sounds fun.


Here’s how you play it. You kiss your partner a certain way, and then your partner has to kiss you back in exactly the same way, and so forth.
You could say, “I love kissing you” before you play the game to put your partner in the right mood. Your partner should be able to figure out how you like to be kissed through playing this game."

Don't be afraid to use your hands.,
Leave your partner wanting more.",How to Build Sexual Anticipation With a Kiss," If you want the kiss to be as sexy as possible, then you have to lock lips at the right place and time. Though you shouldn't search forever for the most perfect location in the world, you can put some thought into finding an intimate place for the kiss, especially if you're kissing your partner for one of the first times. Make sure you're alone, and that you're not around any harshly bright lights, and that there's a place where you can sit down if the kiss gets more intimate.


That said, don't go looking for the perfect place forever -- if you feel like the mood is right, you can kiss your partner in the middle of a parking lot!;
, Don't underestimate the effect that soft, sexy lips can have on a kiss. Chapped lips won't get you very far if you're trying to drive your partner wild. Make an effort to put on lip balm about 1-2 hours before the kiss, and to moisturize your lips frequently before you kiss so that you can have the best kiss possible. Just don't put on lip balm too soon before you kiss, or your partner will be able to taste it.


Don't let your partner see you putting on lip balm, or you'll be making your intentions a little bit too obvious.

, If you want to build sexual anticipation, then you have to flirt a bit first, so that your kissing partner wants it even more. Take a moment to be playful, to make intense eye contact with your partner and then to break it away, and to give your partner a playful touch on the arm, shoulder, or back. You can even lean close to your partner and then lean back a bit, so that it's guaranteed that he or she is thinking about kissing you.


You can also flirt by sitting by your partner and holding hands or playfully kissing him or her on the cheek. Any physical touch can help the flirtation move forward.

, A build up of sexual tension is electrifying, but leaning in at the wrong time or catching someone unawares will only lead to a very awkward, uncomfortable moment. When the mood is right, you'll know. The world around you will be quiet, and the only thing on your mind will be how much you want to kiss the person across from you.


When you're ready to kiss, you and your partner should be tapering off your conversation and getting ready to pay attention only to each other.
You may find that the person you're going to kiss is getting increasingly nervous or fidgety because he or she is nervous about starting the kissing session. Don't worry -- you both will be able to relax once you kiss each other.

, Start small with gentle little kisses to the lips. Incorporate gentle touch, whether holding hands, or the back of the head, or the face. The eyes, cheeks and hair are all erogenous zones and will respond strongly to loving kisses. If you go for it too much at once, your partner may not be ready for your moves. Wait for your partner to pick up the pace along with you before you initiate anything new.


Even if you want to kiss more deeply or to be more aggressive, hold yourself back and you'll be building the anticipation even further.

, Run your tongue along the bottom lip or the inside of your partner's upper lip. This is sensuous but can tickle. Explore the bottom lip by gently and slowly kissing this lip only with the both of yours then changing to the top lip. You can even tease a little bit here. When your partner is expecting the next kiss, pause, then go in with a sensual kiss that was worth the wait.


If this is your first time French kissing your partner or using your tongue in any capacity during the kissing session, then take it extra slow. You don't want to surprise your partner by using your tongue too soon.

, Get in sync and find the same rhythm as your partner. Use your tongue when your partner does and go back to kissing without the tongue when he or she does the same. Follow the rhythm and soon you will both be in a sensuous flow. You and your partner should be using your tongues about the same amount -- otherwise, your partner may still be a little scared. It's your job to take it to the next level.

, Tug ever so slightly on the bottom lip and pull it towards you before letting it go and going in for another full sensuous kiss. You don't have to have just one kissing style throughout the kissing session, and being sweet and gentle and then sexy and more aggressive will make your partner more excited about kissing you -- and everything that lies ahead.

, Don't kiss in the same old way minute after minute. Most people seem to tilt their heads and kiss to their right. Go a little crazy and try the left side for something different. Try a more aggressive kissing style mixed up with a more slow, sweet style. This can be tricky at first, because the key to sexy kisses is to maintain a steady rhythm, and you don't want to break up the rhythm too much by switching gears. Still, don't worry about having a second or two of uncertainty if it means that you can drive your partner wild by changing up your kissing style!

, While you're kissing your partner, nibble on his or her lip gently and see how he or she responds. To play it safe, do it on the light side and make your bites a bit more firm if your partner likes what you've got to offer. Chances are, your partner will be turned on and excited by your spontaneous risk-taking kissing skills.

, A little bit of teasing can go a long way in building sexual anticipation. One thing you can do is kiss your partner, and just when things are getting really heated, pull back, make intense eye contact, making your partner think about how much he or she wants you, and then lean in for another kiss again. If you do this once or twice during the kissing session, it'll drive your partner wild.


Also, know that it's okay to take a break from kissing if you feel like it (instead of only doing it to tease your partner). Even the world's most expert kissers need a break now and then.

, Kissing doesn't have to be all about the lips. In fact, if you kiss with your hands at your sides or on your lap, you'll be missing out on the full-body experience and may look and feel like a limp fish. You don't have to get too handsy to make your partner even more excited. Just use your hands to touch your partner's back, arms, hair, or neck, and you'll be adding an extra layer of excitement to your kisses.


Lightly running your hand along your partner's neck while you're kissing will drive him or her wild.

, The important thing about building sexual anticipation is that you can't give it up too fast or too soon. Whether you want your kisses to build anticipation for something you'll do immediately, or to generally make your partner even more excited, you can't move on to the next stage too soon if you want to build the anticipation. Don't go straight from kissing to the bedroom, or your partner won't have time to really get excited for the next stage. Kiss for at least a few minutes before you start taking it to the next level if you want your partner to be as excited as possible.


Don't think that you have to stop caring about your kissing technique once you move to the bedroom. Your kisses will always matter, and you can always improve your kissing style to make your partner go even more wild -- at any stage of the relationship!

Take care of your lips and mouth.",How to Bite Someone's Lip," Wait until you get a pretty clear indication that he or she is ready for a little passionate smooching. If your kissing partner seems ambivalent to your advances or a little shy, now is not the time to try something as fierce as a lip bite. After all, even the gentlest of nibbles is still a bite.


Exact cues will vary by person, but in general, look for signs that suggest openness and a desire for intimacy. If your partner is snuggling against you, staring deeply into your eyes, or seductively licking his or her lips, you probably have the green light.;
, Once you get the green light, escalate the heat level between you and your kissing partner by reducing the amount of physical distance between the two of you. This technique will only work if you can create a steamy ambiance first, and you will not be able to do that if the two of you are standing apart at arm's length.


You do not need to be completely intertwined for this to work, but you should at least be touching in more places than only your lips.
Also keep in mind that you can narrow the space between you even more as the kiss intensifies.

, Your initial lip lock can be sweet or steamy, depending on how intense the mood between you already is. As a general rule of thumb, though, it is better to start off a little milder in your kisses before building up to a bite.

, The kisses between you and your kissing partner need to build to a highly sensual level. The keyword here is “build,” though. The most effective kiss will intensify to a passionate, steamy state gradually, rather than being rushed to that point.


If you really want to drag things out, you can begin with a closed mouth kiss before moving onto an open mouth kiss. You can also do a little French kissing, or you can gently suck on your partner's lower lip as the first hint that a bite might follow.

, Once you are ready to initiate a bite, part your lips slightly and let your teeth gently graze your kissing partner's bottom lip. Your teeth should only graze at this point and should not yet move in for a bite.


Grazing your teeth against your partner's lip foreshadows the bite itself. If your kissing partner is not comfortable with a bite, this signal lets him or her know that now is the time to redirect your efforts or pull back.

, Take your kissing partner's bottom lip in between your top and bottom teeth. Use light pressure to grab the lip and tug down on it just a bit.


Typically, you should aim for the bottom lip. You can experiment by nibbling on the upper lip, as well, but a light bite and tug on the bottom lip is usually considered to be more sensual.

, The idea behind biting someone's lip during a kiss is to give him or her a little thrill to heighten the passion and intimacy of the kiss. Do not make the bite itself the main feature of the kiss; instead, you should treat it as a little garnish to make the presentation all the more appealing.

, You can give your kissing partner a few gentle bites in this manner, but even if you use gentle nibbles, doing too much can quickly cause his or her lip to turn raw and bloody. This, of course, will probably be a major turn off, and you may find your kissing partner a little less eager to lean in for another smooch the next time around – if that time comes around at all.


If done right, your kissing partner will get chills from the biting, not pinches or stabs of pain.
Think of the experience as a sweet-and-spicy sort of deal. Kissing is sweeter while bites are a little on the spicier side. Combining the two “flavors” can lead to a more memorable experience.

, A good kiss will be good for both people involved. You might be enjoying yourself, but you need to make sure that the person you kiss can enjoy himself or herself, too.


A negative reaction could mean that you are biting down more than you realized or that your kissing partner has sensitive lips that are easily hurt by a little nibbling. Even if this is no the case, though, it is also possible that he or she just does not feel comfortable with the biting or does not consider it to be much of a turn on. No matter what the cause, though, the point to remember is that you should stop as soon as you get a negative response to the biting (or to any other trick you might try while making out, for that matter).Negative reactions are usually pretty obvious. If your partner jerks away, tries to redirect the kiss, pushes you away, or makes a verbal “ow” noise, he or she probably is not enjoying the biting. On the other hand, if your partner draws you closer, moans contentedly, or sighs blissfully, you are doing something right.

, You can make a bite to the lip even more sensual by simultaneously pressing your hips up against your kissing partner's hip when you nibble on his or her lower lip.


The most sexually intimate parts of your body are below the waist. Even if you do not plan on going any further than kissing, pressing your bodies together below the waist can trigger a greater level of physiological desire, which can make your make-out session even better than it already was.

, Instead of keeping your hands in one place, like at the back of your kissing partner's head or neck, you should let them roam over his or her body a bit. Exactly where you let your hands roam will depend on how intimate you and your partner are willing to get at this point, so keep that in mind as you figure out where to place your hands.


If you and your kissing partner are already at a fairly passionate level of intimacy, you can incorporate other subtle applications of aggressiveness. For instance, you can rake your fingers through your partner's hair or down the side of the neck and back. Just keep in mind that the idea is to heighten the sense of connection between you, not to cause pain or draw blood.

, Lip balm offers two benefits. The first benefit is that it makes your lips softer in the long run, thereby making them more enjoyable to kiss. The second benefit is that a flavored or scented lip balm can intensify the kiss for your partner by engaging more of his or her senses, especially if you choose the right flavor.


Sweet flavors and minty flavors are the best to choose from.Sweet flavors, like strawberry, can activate the taste buds toward the front of the tongue that respond to sweetness. As a result, when you kiss in between nibbles, your kissing partner's sense of taste will really kick in.
Similarly, the menthol in mint flavors can cause the body's cold receptors to kick in. When you combine this with the sensation of warm lips and warm breath, you can create a tingling sensation that can intensify the experience for both of you.

, You might not think about it much during the middle of a kiss, but good oral hygiene is important if you want someone to think of you as a really good kisser. Your mouth needs to be clean and your lips need to be soft and moist.


On the most basic level, brushing your teeth two to three times a day will keep them clean and help your breath stay fresh. You can also use a bit of mouthwash for extra freshness.
To make your lips softer, exfoliate with a lip exfoliate or non-toxic body scrub once a week. Apply lip balm with SPF after you get out of the shower and whenever your lips feel dry. For girls, you should also apply a layer of lip balm to your lips before layering on lip gloss or lipstick.

Smile and relax.",How to Be Kissable," Begin by brushing and flossing your teeth twice daily. Don't forget the tongue because 90% of bad breath is the result of a dirty tongue. Throughout the day use breath mints, breath strips, or gum. If you use mouthwash, use one that is clear and alcohol free--colored formulas stain teeth over time, and alcohol deteriorates gum tissue. If you choose gum, make sure you have an easy way to get rid of it before kissing.;
, You should apply lip balm frequently (carry one in your pocket or purse). This will help keep your lips soft. The best choices are Carmex, Nivea, Burt's Bees, Vaseline (in moderation because you don't want the other person to worry about getting gooey Vaseline or Carmex all over them), SoftLips, or EOS (Evolution of Smooth).

, The saliva dries out your lips, causing them to crack, split, or become chapped. And no one wants to kiss rough lips.

, Always wash your face with a mild, unscented soap DESIGNED for the face. And don't forget moisturizer! This protects your pores from dirt that can cause acne and prevents build up of oils. (Who would want to kiss you if your skin shines like sweat?).

, This provides the intimate connection that is an invitation to kissing. If you have large glasses try taking them off, or getting contacts for the future. Some people absolutely hate it when your glasses start to interfere with the contact. Try taking them off before kissing though, since a hand gesture toward your glasses might be found unromantic. Just keep light, welcoming eye contact. Do not stare, as this may be a bit frightening and/or make the other person uncomfortable.

, Make sure you are wearing comfortable clothes. And if you're a guy, most people like smooth hairless faces so don't forget to shave if you need to.

, Some people think this connotes the idea of kissing and hopefully he/she will pick up the hint. But, more often than not, it just ends up making people think that's all you want to do, and you aren't listening to them. Relax and let nature take it's course, and try not to be obsessed with it too much.

, Just before kissing - swallow discretely. As you move your tongue around your mouth (French) and use a very light sucking action (standard kiss), the glands on your tongue and in your mouth will produce more saliva. You don't want your lips dry but you certainly don't want to dribble in your partner's mouth either.

, When you are tense, your whole body will respond including your tongue and lips. Don't worry - they are probably JUST as nervous as you are in either a first kiss or the first kiss of a new relationship. You can now be an expert first time round.

You can also gently lean your forehead against your kissing partner's, put your hand on his face, touch his leg, or even give him or her a quick peck on the lips before you really start kissing. This helps start a connection and gets your partner more ready to kiss you; if you swoop in without any warning, the kissing session may be unexpected -- and not in a good way.


Your eye contact doesn't have to be super intense, especially if you're just starting out with this person. Just a few seconds of eye contact should get the message across.;
, This is very important. The best way to prevent head-butting, elbowing, and clanking teeth is to do everything slowly, especially in the beginning and when you're changing positions. As time progresses, you can introduce more passionate kissing techniques, but they can only be sustained for so long. Always return to a slow, comfortable pace. Start with a kiss on the lips, then, if you want to French kiss, slowly move your tongue into your partner's mouth as he or she does the same.


Once your tongues are in each other's mouths, you can move them slowly in a circular motion, move them on top of each other, or do whatever feels good without moving too fast or getting sloppy.
Remember that if you're making out for the first time, you have to be extra cautious before you begin. The first time is about figuring out the person's comfort level, boundaries, and favorite maneuvers.

, This doesn't mean that you should frantically paw your kissing partner every chance you get. However, you'll be more comfortable kissing if you don't keep your hands neatly planted on your lap. Once you're comfortable, and especially if you're sitting down, try to explore your kissing partner's body -- as long as you're both okay with it. Basically, just keep your hands moving from time to time, so you don't get stuck in the same old boring position. Try cupping their face, touching their waist, or holding hands.


If you're kissing a man, put your arms around his neck or touch his arms, neck, back of his head, or even his chest.
If you're kissing a woman, touch her shoulders and her waist, and wait for the signal that she's ready for more.

, You can still play hard to get in the middle of a make out session. When it's going great, just pull back for a second and look into your kissing partner's eyes. Locking eyes will be sexy and will make your kissing partner want to kiss you even more badly. Though you shouldn't try this move all the time, once or twice per make out session will do the trick.


This is also a great move if you need a little break from so much kissing.

, Taking a little break from kissing is perfectly fine and can even help get you back into the kissing mindset. If you're tired but don't want to stop yet, just come up for air, slow down your kissing pace, or don't be afraid to take a quick bathroom break or ask for a glass of water. If you're not feeling comfortable with so much kissing, then you won't be able to enjoy yourself or give your best effort.


It's okay. Taking a break from time to time will actually make you a better kisser.

, A little verbal communication will keep things interesting. It's not a good time to start a deep conversation, though. Just a small phrase in a soft voice, especially when accompanied by eye contact and a smile will communicate closeness during the make out without saying a whole lot. You don't have to be silent to be sexy, and if you want to say something, as long as it won't ruin the mood, go for it.


Obviously, you shouldn't switch the subject from anything romantic completely. Now's not the time to ask about the math homework.

, This isn't the movies, where it's all perfect and planned out! You're both human and there will be awkward moments here and there, no matter how many instructions you read. If anything awkward does happen, be quick to mend it with some light laughter or a gentle push. Making out is just as much about having fun as it is about being turned on.


If you're fumbling awkwardly, really, it's better to make a joke about it than to pretend you're Mr. Smooth.

, Vary the kissing routine by moving away from their lips occasionally. Again, move slowly. If you move too quickly, they might not know what you're doing and next thing you know, your lips are crashing into their nose. Kiss the corner of their mouth gently, making your way along their jawline. You can move up to your partner's temple and forehead, or down to his or her neck.


Try giving your kissing partner a slightly wet kiss on the neck and then blow on it so they feel a shiver.

, If your partner is a man, run your fingers through his hair along the scalp from front to back, all the way down to his neck. If your partner is a lady, you can run your fingers down her hair, letting the strands run through your fingers. The head is one of the most sensitive parts of the human body. Don't underestimate the hair as an important place to touch during a make out session.


Keep in mind, however, that some hairstyles are not conducive to this. If she has her hair tied up or it's quite curly, your fingers might get trapped. Instead, run the tips of your fingers slowly along the top and around her ear, as if you're tucking a stray strand behind her ear.

, Hey, biting your partner's neck, ears, or even his or her bottom lip can do wonders for your make out session. Don't be afraid to try it once you're comfortable enough with your partner to experiment. Take a very gentle bite of his bottom lip, and then work your way over to nibble on his or her earlobe or neck and see how your love responds. If administered correctly, the tiny bite can make your partner go crazy with pleasure.


Be forewarned: the gentle -- or not so gentle -- bite is not for all tastes, but if your special someone likes it, he will really like it.
If you're nervous about this move, practice on your hand first.

, Whispering in your partner's ear is a great way to keep the passion going when you take a break from kissing. Just take a break, lean in to your special someone's ear, and whisper something short and sweet that lets him or her know how much you like kissing. Just say, ""You're so sexy,"" or, ""I've been wanting to kiss you all day,"" and your boyfriend or girlfriend will love it.


As you're talking, you can breathe on your partner's neck to make him shiver.

, The most important thing to keep in mind as you make out is to keep things interesting by trying something new every once in a while. Just sitting there with your hands in the same position, kissing in the same way, will get old fast. So, mix things up between pecks on the lips, gentle love bites, passionate French kissing, and doing whatever else you need to do to keep things interesting.


You don't have to try 10,000 new moves in the middle of a make out session. But trying at least two or three different things can help spice things up.

, There are two post-make out options: either you move on to something more and get even more hot and heavy, or you realize that you want to take a break. Assuming you want to take a break or stop kissing, slowly move away from your partner, giving him one last, passionate kiss. You don't have to end things abruptly. When you feel like you're getting tired, or know that you have to leave soon, then you should slowly start removing yourself from the situation, limb by limb.


Don't apologize about it. Everyone needs a break from time to time.

, Give your significant other some validation by giving him a big hug, one last kiss, or a big smile -- or even by saying, ""That was amazing,"" or ""I love kissing you."" Even ""I can't get enough of you"" will do the trick if you mean it. Your special someone should feel confident and good about what just happened so it can happen again.


Don't be shy. You don't have to blurt out ""I love you!"" but hey, if you had a hot time, let it be known.

, As you finish up the make out session, you should make sure that there's a repeat on the horizon. When you're done kissing, you should still stay sexy, be affectionate, and leave your kissing partner wanting more. You can say you can't wait to hang out again when you say goodbye, or even send a cute text saying what a great time you had later.


Though it may be hard to stay in the mood forever, try to keep things sexy for as long as you can after the make out session. That will make your kissing partner even more eager to see you again.

Avoid puckering or pursing them, as this will send the wrong message and make kissing physically difficult.
Tackle dryness with chapstick or by licking your lips slightly. Ladies, try using chapstick or lip balm rather than lip gloss, as lip gloss can be sticky, while chapstick can make your lips irresistibly soft, shiny and tasty.;
, The importance of good oral hygiene cannot be underestimated when it comes to kissing is a pretty terrible turn-off. To avoid having a smell breath when you go in for your kiss, remember to floss and brush your teeth before your date and keep a small packet of mints on your person throughout the evening, so you can quickly pop one in your mouth as soon as things start to heat up.


If you're going on a dinner date, try to steer clear of very pungent or malodorous foods -- avoid things like cheese, fish, raw onions, or anything heavy on garlic.
Don't overdo it on the minty freshness though—you don't your mouth to taste like you just swallowed an entire tube of toothpaste!
You can also chew on a fruity piece of gum if mint is not your favorite flavor.
If you don’t have any mints or gum, go to the bathroom and rinse your mouth out to help freshen up your breath.

, Let your partner know that you want to kiss him or her by maintaining eye contact and smiling. Be a little flirtatious, and break the ‘touch barrier’. The touch barrier is when you and your partner have never actually made physical contact. Break the barrier by placing your hand on his or her arm when you laugh, holding hands, or brushing your knee against your partner’s while you are sitting down.


If you are in the middle of a conversation, then slow it down and lower your voice slightly to signal that you’re ready to stop talking and start smooching.
Some people get so nervous before the first kiss with a new partner that they end up talking too much in order to fill the silence. Avoid doing this as it could ruin the moment and make your partner lose interest.

, Being calm and confident can give your kissing skills the boost they need. Confidence is very attractive, so tell yourself that the kiss you are about to have will be amazing—even if this is your first kiss.


Don’t be afraid to practice your kissing technique on something like your hand or a pillow. You can also try licking a lollipop or eating an ice cream cone so the muscles and nerves in your lips and mouth can get used to the movement you will be doing when you French kiss.
It takes a bit of bravery to put yourself out there and go for a kiss, so muster up as much bravery as you can.

, When you're ready and you think the moment is right, take a step closer to your partner and lean in for the kiss. If you want to add to the romance, you can do something intimate like touching your partner's face or brushing the hair out of their eyes right before you lean in.


Watch your partner as you lean in to determine whether to tilt your head to the left or to the right. Remember to move your head in the opposite direction to your partner’s. However, do not stare at your partner, simply subtly check to see which way they are tilting their head.
You should also tilt your head back slightly and point your lips and chin forward to avoid banging your foreheads together.

, Sometimes in the nervousness leading up to a first kiss, you can forget to close your eyes. This is bad for two reasons: firstly, it probably means that you are overthinking things. Closing your eyes allows you to relax, let go of your inhibitions and just enjoy the moment.


Secondly, if your partner opens their eyes during the kiss and finds you staring straight back at them, it would be kind of creepy and will probably kill the romance.
A word of warning though—don't close your eyes until after you have found the other person's lips, otherwise you're likely to bump foreheads, noses, or chins.

, To begin your kiss, keep your mouth closed. You don’t want to rush your partner or seem overly eager. Start off with a few slow, gentle kisses, lingering on your partner’s lips each time.


Keep things interesting by repositioning your lips in between each kiss. Tilt your head slightly more to the left or slightly more to the right, or switch sides entirely so that your head is now tilted in the opposite direction as before.

, After the first kiss, draw back very slightly and look at your partner. This will allow you to do two things. First, you will be able to assess if they are in to the kiss to and you should keep going.


Second, you can take a moment to heighten the romance by looking into your partner’s eyes and making a small gesture, like putting your hand behind his or her neck and drawing your partner back into another kiss (if that seems to be what he or she wants).

, Kissing is an intimate experience; while leaning in for a kiss in the beginning is normal, standing sort of far away with only your lips touching might come across as a bit odd. Once your partner is receptive to your kisses, move closer and make more physical contact. Ways to do this include:


Wrapping your arms around her shoulders or his waist.
Putting your hand on the back of his or her neck to deepen the kiss.
Running your hands through his or her hair.
Pressing up against each other so that very little space is left between you.

, Since your mouth is occupied, you will need to breathe through your nose while kissing. If you are not getting enough air that way, then pull your face away from your partner’s every once in a while to catch your breath. Make sure to keep the kiss though! (If you want to).

, Once you have been kissing without tongue for a bit, it’s time to take it to the next level. Lock lips with your partner so that his or her bottom lip is in between your two lips, and then open your mouth slightly to signify that you’re ready to French kiss.


Of course, don’t open your mouth so wide that you seem like you are engulfing your partner’s face. Instead, open your mouth subtly and seductively.

, Before you begin to French kiss, spend some time kissing open-mouthed to slowly ease your way into a more passionate kiss.


If you are having trouble finding a kissing rhythm, try mouthing the word “peaches” (though obviously don’t say the word out loud); this may help you to find a rhythm with your partner. You can also try mouthing the word “ma”.

, Start off gently at first, moving your tongue into the front of your partner’s mouth. Avoid immediately jamming your tongue too far into his or her mouth, as this can be a major turn-off. Move your tongue in slow, fluid movements around the other person’s tongue and allow them to reciprocate before going any further.


Start off by gently touching the tip of your tongue to the tip of your partner’s tongue.
Pay attention to your partner’s movements. Being a good kisser is about being in sync with the other person and finding a rhythm that works for both of you. If they begin to draw back, withdraw your tongue.

, If both of you feel comfortable with the deepened kiss, you can move your tongue deeper into your partner’s mouth and begin massaging their tongue with yours. Slow and playful motions with your tongue can be arousing and will help you to deepen the kiss. Allow your tongue to travel around your partner’s mouth and make circles around your partner’s tongue. However, there are definitely some things that you want to avoid as the kiss gets deeper.


Don’t try to shove your tongue far back into your partner’s mouth. This could cause your partner an unpleasant sensation much like choking.
Do not thrust your tongue in and out of your partner’s mouth. Slow, gentle movements will be a whole lot more intimate than a wild propeller of a tongue jabbing at your partner’s face.
Do not add so much tongue that you are essentially licking your partner’s face. Wet kisses tend to come across as sloppy, so try to avoid getting saliva on your partner’s lips of face.

, Part of being a great kisser is being able to adjust to the style of kissing that your partner likes. Try different things while you kiss your partner and see how they react. For instance, you could try using a bit more tongue, or ‘tongue wrestling’ with your partner’s tongue.


It is important to remember that everyone has a different style of kissing. It might take a little while for you to find a rhythm with your partner, but just remember that they are paying attention to your movements too. Kissing is a duet, not a solo.

, One thing that can take a bit of the romance out of a kiss is knocking teeth together. When making out, try to keep your teeth out of the way by tilting your head to different angles. Don’t open your mouth too wide, or it may become easier to accidentally knock teeth.

, Try gently (emphasis on gently) biting or sucking your partner's lower or upper lip. If done correctly, this can be a major turn-on for the other person.


If your sucking is pulling your partner’s lip far away from their face, you are probably sucking too hard. Keep your sucking gentle and playful, rather than hard or intense.

, Place your hands gently on your partner’s waist, shoulders, face, or neck if they are not there already. If things get heated up, grab your partner harder and move your hands from one body part to the other. Using your hand on your partner's shoulder or neck you can communicate things like ""come closer"" ""I liked that"" or ""more"".


Increase the intensity of the moment by placing your hands on the back of your partner’s head and grabbing his or her hair. You can also run your hands along his or her spine.
However, do not hold your partner so tightly that he or she feels trapped. Let go if your partner begins to draw back or move away. Never grope your partner without their consent. Stay away from ""bathing suit"" areas until you know that your partner wants you to touch them there.

, Being a good kisser isn't about doing everything perfectly -- that can become a little mechanical. Sometimes it's good to throw something a bit different into the mix, something that surprises your partner (in a good way) and leaves them wanting more.


Try licking the center of your partner's open lips with your tongue, or using your tongue to briefly stroke the roof of their mouth. They may find this unusual, but super sexy.
Try inhaling through your mouth instead of your nose when your lips are sealed together -- like you're taking their breath into your body. This can be extremely intimate -- as long as it's not overused.
Try trailing kisses towards your partner’s ear and gently sucking on his or her earlobe (be careful of earrings!).

, Being a kisser also includes being able to kiss your partner on other places besides their lips. After you have been making out for awhile, allow your mouth to wander. Trail kisses across your partner’s face and down his or her neck or shoulder (if he is her shoulder is exposed).


Make sure that you are not trailing saliva across your partner's neck. Keep these sort of kisses dry but intimate.

, The more excited you are about the kiss, the more excited your partner will be. You should be completely present in the moment and try to avoid letting your mind wander to other things. Allow yourself to relax, and don’t spend the entire time wondering what the other person is thinking — go with the flow and have fun!


If your phone rings, do not pick it up. That will make your partner think that you were uninterested in the kiss. Focus entirely on your partner and what is happening between you.

, Non-romantic kisses are appropriate for friends and family members who you care for deeply. These types of kisses are appropriate for the cheek, hand and forehead in some instances.


In many cultures, it is appropriate to kiss a friend or family member once or twice on the cheek when greeting each other or parting ways. Forehead kisses are usually more romantic in nature, and are appropriate for lovers, close friends, and/or exes.

, For a friendly kiss, you should always keep your lips pursed together and completely dry. Wet kisses can be extremely unpleasant, so be sure to wipe your mouth beforehand if necessary!


Ladies, if you are wearing lipstick or lipgloss, it might be a good idea to wipe it off with a napkin beforehand (unless, of course, you are purposely trying to leave a kiss-mark on this person’s cheek).

, Be sure to keep the kiss(es) short and sweet to avoid sending the wrong message or making the other person feel uncomfortable.


Avoid lingering too long, unless you are hoping that the non-romantic kiss will turn into something more than that.

There is nothing wrong with kissing in public, but strangers may not appreciate watching an entire make out session.
Go to a room in your house where you can be alone with your partner. If you're away from home and you just can't wait, try to find a safe, quiet spot outside.;
, Candles offer low light, which is relaxing and flattering. Light some candles across the room to help set the mood. You could also try stringing some holiday lights around the room.

Use scented candles for added effect. Choose warm scents that work well together, and avoid anything overpowering.If you don't have access to any candles, try replacing your white light bulb with a softer toned yellow one. The goal is a low, relaxing light in the room., Make a playlist with some romantic songs that both you and your partner enjoy. Keep the music low enough so that you can talk to each other.

Find songs that are slow and easy to listen to. Avoid anything too energetic. Try to set a quiet, romantic mood., You don't have to whisper everything, but keep your voice down when you talk to your partner. Soft tones are soothing and help build passion.

Using a softer voice also means your partner will have to get closer to you, which could create an opening for a kiss., The majority of making out is kissing your partner. When the mood strikes, lean in for a kiss. Make sure your partner is leaning in as well. If they aren't, they may not be in the mood to kiss.

Pay attention to the tilt of your partner's head. The last thing you want is an awkward head bump when trying to kiss. Go in slow.Close your eyes. It's not a hard and fast rule to close your eyes when you kiss, but it does add to the romance. However, some people enjoy kissing with their eyes open. Play around and find what you like.Put your lips on your partner's lips and kiss. Don't smack their lips, just apply light pressure to theirs and see if they kiss back. You'll know it when you feel it., Keep the kiss soft and don't immediately start using your tongue. Kiss your partner's lips and then slowly start to open your mouth. Try to read your partner's reaction and make sure they are willing to go along with your kiss.


If things are going well, try to use your tongue. Open your mouth a little and touch your tongue to theirs. Don't shove your tongue in their mouth, and don't use too much tongue. Think of playing with your partner's tongue and see how they use theirs., When you kiss your partner, pull away for a second and run the tip of your tongue around the edges of your partner's lips.

Don't do this all the time, but do it enough to playfully tease your partner.You can also nibble on your partner's lips in between kisses to mix things up.

, Pull your partner in close to kiss them when they aren't expecting it. Place one hand on their waist and another behind their head and go in for a long, strong kiss.

This is a good technique for an opening kiss. If you're in the middle of making out, stop kissing for a moment. Look your partner in the eyes and then pull them in close., Take a break from kissing your partner on the mouth and play with their ear lobes. Use your tongue to trace the edges of the ear.


Don't stick your tongue in their ear. Suck or nibble on their ear lobes, and then softly run your tongue around the outer ear.
You can also use your fingers to trace the edges of the ear while you are kissing.

, Keep a glass of water with a few ice cubes in it next to you during your make out session. Stop kissing for a second, take a drink of water and hold one of the ice cubes in your mouth. Get your mouth cold, and then kiss your partner to give them chills.

Kiss your partner's lips, neck, ears, and chest. Tease them a little with your cold lips., Don't settle for just one kissing technique. Keep things interesting by using a variety of kisses when you make out.


Start with slightly open mouthed kissing and move into slow kisses around the neck and ears. Then go back in for more kissing on the lips. Whatever you do, have fun and experiment with your partner.

, When making out, try to stimulate your partner by touching them in various places. Don't grope your partner, but use soft touches to keep your partner interested.

Touch the neck, back, arms, and legs. Gently run your fingers across your partner's skin while you make out.Run your fingers through your partner's hair while you kiss.
Play with your partner's hands while you kiss. Hold their hands, interlock your fingers, or softly rub your fingers over theirs.

, You can face each other while you kiss, but feel free to mix it up. Sit in your partner's lap and wrap your legs around their back to really take control.


Try kissing from behind your partner. Lie behind them and hug them close. Start kissing their neck and ears and gently turn their head to yours.

, Take a few breaks every now and then to make eye contact with your partner. Kissing is a big part of making out, but so is keeping the passion high.


Don't forget to keep touching your partner while you look at them. Rub their shoulders and arms, or run your fingers over their lips. Try to keep them aroused without kissing them. Give them compliments and let them know how you feel.

, Making out is a full body activity. While kissing your partner, don't forget to move. It's important to feel your partner's body. Pay attention to what they like, and how they respond to your touch.


If you feel things getting heavy during your make out session, you may feel your partner grinding on you. They may want to take things to the next level. If you aren't ready to have sex, don't feel pressured. Making out can be fun on its own, and does not always have to lead to sex."

Be patient.",How to Ask a Girl for a Kiss," Grab her attention with soft, kind eye contact. Hold here eyes for longer than a second or two, until there is a breathless, timeless space that surrounds you. The world disappears, and it's just the two of you. To get her attention, keep it minimal and subtle:


Touch her shoulder, upper arm, or cheek and say her name.
A simple, quiet ""hey"" is still the most effective way to get her attention.
""I need you for a moment"" or ""just one more thing"" is a great, noncommittal way to hold her attention for an end of the date kiss.
Move in for a big, full-body hug to see if she's feeling equally romantic.;
, Polite, simple, and to the point, these lines get right to the point and put it in her court. Keep eye contact when talking, and keep your head close enough that you can both move in when she says yes.


""Can I kiss you?""
""Can we kiss?""
""Is it okay if I kiss you right now?""

, Honesty, in all things, is the best policy. So just tell her you want to kiss her -- it's not forceful or rude, just confidently romantic.


""I want to kiss you right now."" Unless she says ""no,"" move in slowly after you say it.
""I'd love a kiss before I go.""
""Let's kiss.""
""Write her a note saying ""kiss me?"" or ""I want to kiss you,"" if you think she'd like the cute, romantic gesture. Then move in wordlessly., Don't dive for lips, just move in slowly. Give her the chance to move in or gracefully bow back out. If she isn't feeling it and doesn't want to kiss, she'll say no and lean away.


Move in slowly.
Half-close your eyes
Let her come part way, meeting you for the kiss.
Hold her close with a hug, keeping your faces close together. If she keeps eye contact, move in.

, There are a ton of reasons she might say no, but none of them need to be returned with rudeness. She just might not be ready yet. Be sure to politely apologize for misreading things, then move on -- she'll appreciate it.


""I'm sorry. I had a wonderful time tonight-- I'll see you around.
""I misread things, I'm sorry. Have a great night.""
""I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that, I'm sorry."", If this is the first time that you're kissing this girl, you'll want to make it special. Take her to a place that is meaningful to both of you. Kiss her somewhere with a beautiful view: the top of a hill, mountain, building, bridge. Kiss her under the stars, or when the sun is setting. Most girls will really appreciate it if you take the time to make a first kiss special.If you want to make this a romantic kiss, pick a setting that matches the mood. Don't just kiss her at the mall, or at a mundane moment. Plan ahead for something special.

, The moment will be more intimate, if you're alone, and your timing may seem much more natural. Don't ask her for a kiss in front of your friends or family, nor in front of hers. An audience, however small, will put her under unfair pressure. Even if she does want to kiss you, she might shy away if she feels uncomfortable with the setting.


You may also find that it's much easier to ask this girl for a kiss if you're alone with her. Take the pressure off of yourself as well as off of her!

, Flirt with her, and make playful banter. Make plenty of eye contact, and casually touch her to loosen the physical boundaries.Smile at her, and make her feel comfortable. Even if you already know that you like each other: a bit of flirtation can set the mood up for a kiss.


Don't touch her too much, at first. Put your hand on your shoulder or your hand when you talk to her, or put your arm around her, intentionally brush your arm against hers. Find a reason to sit close to her, so that your shoulders and thighs are touching.

, If the two of you have been flirting, then you should be able to tell. Look out for classic signs of attraction: laughter, touch, and eye contact.If she pays a lot of attention to you, and she seems to make a point of being around you, then there's a good chance that she's interested.


Try not to make this assumption unless you're reasonably sure. It is good to be confident, but try to keep a level head about the situation.

, Make your move during a slow song at a dance, or when you see a shooting star. Wait for the end of a date, when you're saying your parting words. Kiss her after you make her laugh, or after you tell her that you like her.


Imagine that you are in a movie. The ""right moment"" might feel like the scene when the hero kisses the girl. Don't build it up too much – but keep the ambiance in mind.

, If you are alone with her, and the mood is good, and you think that she wants you to kiss her, then there's a pretty good chance that the time is right. If you feel an overwhelming urge to kiss her: do it. There is no definitive ""best"" time to ask a girl for a kiss. You'll need to read the situation, be bold, and make your move. Seize the moment when it comes.

, It might be tempting to leap at the first chance that you get. Read the contextual clues, however, and consider whether there is any reason that it'd be inappropriate to ask her for a kiss right now. Don't force the situation. If you're going to ask a girl for a kiss, let the moment blossom naturally.


It's better to wait than to kiss her at the wrong time. If she is sad, or angry, or otherwise bothered by something, a first kiss may not be the way to distract her. Kiss her when she's in a good mood and receptive to being kissed.

Take a deep breath and relax.,
Maintain eye contact before the kiss.,
Start small with light lip-to-lip contact.,
Don’t over analyze the moment.",How to Avoid Bad First Kisses1," You are about to enjoy a physical connection with someone you like, and who likes you. There’s no need to be nervous, because there’s no right way or wrong way to kiss. Relaxing will help you feel more comfortable about the kiss. Trust that the two of you will figure it out together., Seeing each other will help you both remember that you’re going to enjoy sharing this moment with one another. Eye contact also lets your partner know that you are attentive and interested, which can help them feel more comfortable., It’s okay for your first kiss to be brief and simple. There’s no need to set high expectations of a lingering embrace. A long, heavy kiss can be intimidating. Sharing a quick moment of intimacy can still tell you a lot about your compatibility., Dissecting every part of the kiss will lead to more nervousness. Remember that a first kiss is just a first attempt. Additional kisses with the same partner, as well as kisses with others over the course of time, will give you a chance to learn what you like and what you don’t."

Kiss the girl.",How to Become Comfortable with Kissing a Girl," Think about asking your crush on a date or to get a cup of coffee and imagine her saying, “I’d love to!” Picturing positive outcomes can help you slowly build the confidence you need to feel and look more comfortable when you approach a girl in a romantic situation.When you mentally picture a negative outcome to a situation, try to counteract the thought by telling yourself, “That is one way things could happen, but here’s a better outcome.”
Don’t try to counteract your positive mental image once you’ve pictured it. Allow yourself to believe that the outcome you pictured is a possibility.;
, Help boost your confidence approaching and interacting with girls by practicing with some that you don’t want to kiss. Try holding conversations with or paying compliments to girls other than your crush as a way of practicing your skills for when you approach her.Do not lead anyone on or try to make someone believe you have feeling for them when you do not.
Instead, try paying a girl a simple, sincere compliment such as, “Your answer in class today was really insightful,” or, “I really like how you’re wearing your hair today.”
Remember that compliments and conversations can and generally should be about more than physical attraction or attributes. Try to pay attention to her mind and personality if you really want her to notice you.

, Just as there are some girls you wouldn’t want to kiss or ask out, some girls won’t want to kiss or go out with you. It may sting at first, but it’s important to remind yourself, “This rejection simply lets me focus on pursuing someone with whom I’m more compatible.” If you are feeling hurt by rejection, remind yourself of your positive attributes. Let yourself know, “I am smart, funny, and I have great hair. There is a girl out there who will be happy to kiss someone like me.”
Remember that no girl owes you anything. She does not have to kiss you if she does not want to, and you cannot force her to change her mind, nor can you force yourself on her.

, Going straight for the kiss tends to work best in movies. In real life, it will help ease your nerves and make her more comfortable if you start things slow. Ask your crush out on a date like getting coffee or even on a study date if you two are in a class together.Take the time on the date to get to know her. Ask her questions such as, “What sort of hobbies are you into?” Offer your own views on her responses with statements like, “I’ve never done that activity but I would really like to try it.”
Actively listen to her responses. Listen to what she’s saying to get a better idea of whether she is looking for a romantic partner or if she’s more interested in making friends. Statements like, “My last crush didn’t work out so well,” could indicate she’s not looking for anything right now.
Look your crush in the eyes when you are talking to her. This allows her to feel respected and listened to, and helps you better see and interpret her body language.

, Flirting is both verbal and physical. Watch a girl’s body language to see if she’s showing signs of interest. Physical signals such as leaning toward you, touching your shoulder or arm, or looking away and giggling when you catch her eye could all be indicators of her interest.Look for multiple body language cues that indicate interest. Just one may be the result of a habit or friendly behavior, but multiple cues can help better indicate interest.
If you think she might be interested in you, test the waters by gently touching her on the hand or forearm. If she pulls away, don’t be insulted or act cruel. Just understand that she was not comfortable with you in her space at that time.

, It’s a completely made-up idea that kisses need to be spontaneous or a surprise. If you like a girl and you think things are going well between the two of you, let her know, “I think I would like to kiss you. Would that be okay?”Many girls will take being asked whether or not they want a kiss as a sign of respect and a show of affection. Don’t be afraid to ask.
Allow her space to be honest. If she says yes, go in for the kiss. If she says no, accept her answer and thank her for her honesty.

, There is no mandate that you have to kiss anyone at any point in time. Take time to remember that you are in control, and you get to decide who you kiss and when. Do not let others pressure you into the idea that you must kiss someone at a specific time or moment.Feeling more in control of the situation will help you relax and gain more comfort with the physical kissing process.

, A kiss may feel strange or intimidating if you don't have tolerance for other types of physical contact. Start with actions such as holding hands, touching the girl on the shoulder, or allowing her to cuddle up next to you with your arm wrapped around her. Establishing baselines for physical contact will help make the eventual kiss more comfortable.Always make sure that your partner is comfortable with any physical contact. If you are not completely sure of what they want, ask them, ""Can I hold your hand?"" or, ""Would you mind if I put my arm around you?"", Even if a girl likes you, she is not going to want to kiss someone with bad breath or food stuck in their teeth. Before the end of your time with your crush, excuse yourself to the bathroom to check for debris in your smile and pop a mint or brush your teeth.You may want to consider carrying a tin of your favorite mints with you on your date. Do not rely on gum, as it does less to mask bad breath.
You may also want to apply a little lip balm to help your lips from feeling chapped or uncomfortable.

, A kiss on the cheek is a nice gesture at the end of a date or a flirty hangout session, especially if you haven’t asked her if a lip-to-lip kiss is okay. Lean in and give her a light kiss on the cheek, and thank her for her time and company. Then, wait to see how she responds.If she smiles, giggles, or lets you know that she enjoyed the cheek kiss, it may be an indicator that she’s open to a kiss on the lips.
If she states that she does not think of you in a romantic way or otherwise appears uncomfortable with your actions, accept the rejection and do not push her into further discomfort.

, A first kiss will always be a little scary, but it should also be exciting. If you have a good sense that both of you are ready for it, or if you’ve asked her if she’d like a kiss, all that’s left to do is lean in and put your lips against hers. You will typically have a pretty good instinct of what to do from there.Don’t start with a French kiss or a wet, sloppy kiss. Go for a closed-mouth smooch at first, and wait to see how she reacts before kissing her again.
If you are unsure about her feelings, ask her, “Can I kiss you again?” or “Did you enjoy that?”

Check that your breath is fresh.,
Approach one another slowly.,
Keep movement to a minimum.,
End the kiss gently.",How to Avoid Bad First Kisses2," You can do this by breathing into your cupped palm or bent elbow. A strong taste in your mouth, such as certain foods, beverages, or smoke, can also indicate unfresh breath. If there’s an unpleasant taste or odor, your partner might find it unpleasant. Use a small mint to freshen your breath before hand., Don’t lunge abruptly or lurch without warning. Quick movements are likely to result in an awkward moment of bumped foreheads, bruised lips, or banged teeth. Eye contact can help you negotiate the approach for the kiss. If you move toward one another carefully, the initial lip-to-lip contact will be smooth and natural., There’s no need to move your mouth, head, or body a great deal. Too much movement can be distracting. It can also increase the likelihood of an awkward bump or slip., This can be done with a simple slight turn of the head, tipping up of the chin, or a small step backwards. You’ll know the time is right to end the kiss because of simple physical or emotional cues like:fatigue
excess moisture
discomfort in your jaw
frustration
distraction
lack of enjoyment

"
"
Take and give physical cues.,
Use your whole body.,
Make eye contact afterward.",How to Avoid Bad First Kisses3," Try to demonstrate how you prefer to be kissed. Pay attention to what your partner may be trying to show you about their preferences. Remember, a good first kiss is a team effort., Hands, hair, waist, back, and other areas are parts you might like to touch and have touched while you kiss. Your partner might guide you to touch them in places they’d enjoy. If you’re comfortable doing so, follow their lead., Although this might feel awkward, the moment after is a good time to gauge your partner’s feelings about the kiss. Look at them, and see if they look like they enjoyed it. If you can’t tell from simply looking, you can talk about it. Try starting with:“I really like kissing you.”
“You’re a good kisser.”
“I liked when you…”
“That was nice.”

If you want to plan a romantic date that's perfect for your loved one, then try some of these tips:

, If you want to keep your romance alive, then you should leave thoughtful notes for your loved one to find when you aren't around. If you leave the house earlier than your loved one for work or another reason, leave a post-it note on the bathroom mirror that tells your loved one something like, ""I hope you have a wonderful day, sweetie. I can't wait to see you tonight!"" This will make your loved one smile as soon as he/she sees it. Here are some other ways to leave thoughtful notes:


Leave a note in your loved one's textbook or pleasure-reading book. Your loved one may not find it for a few days, but when he/she does, it'll put a big smile on his/her face.
If your loved one is going away on a trip for a few days, put it in his or her travel bag, in a place where he/she won't look until he/she gets to his/her destination. This will make him/her think of you as soon as he/she opens it, and you won't feel like you're so far away.
If you're feeling really romantic, you can even write a love letter.


, Though you shouldn't smother your loved one with love all day long or its effect will begin to wear off, you can just remind him or her of how much you love him/her by sending a short email during your work day, or sending a sweet text or two just to say that you're thinking of him/her. Here are some ways to send thoughtful texts or emails throughout your day:

Send a quick text that says something like: ""What is my love up to this afternoon? I hope you're enjoying the sunshine.""
Don't go overboard -- just one message each day will get the point across.

, If you want to be romantic, then you have to be able to read your loved one's mind and to know when he or she needs to you to help out a bit by doing a small favor. Though you may not think running to the grocery store to pick up a few day's worth of groceries when your loved one is busy is very romantic, it actually shows that you're thoughtful and attentive to your loved one's needs. Here are some thoughtful favors you can do to show you care:

Make yourself taller or shorter.,
Meet in the middle.,
Stabilize yourselves with a hug.,
Kiss in other, more accessible spots.,
Use the height discrepancy to make your kisses more passionate.",How to Kiss Somebody Who Is a Different Height," Try these subtle ways to reduce the height difference:

If you’re short, get a boost. Take advantage of curbs, steps, slopes, stools, and even chairs to correct for the height difference. Wear heeled shoes if possible. High heels are an obvious choice, but heeled boots can be useful for men and women.
If you’re tall, give your shorter partner the advantage by standing on lower terrain whenever possible. If you’re in the early stages of a relationship and/or your partner is self-conscious, try to do this inconspicuously.
For a sexy pose, spread your legs and lower yourself on a wall, letting your feet grip the ground and your partner stand between your legs. This will let both of you interact on more or less even footing. However this should only be done when you feel that you are in an intimate enough relationship. Alternatively, rest your weight on one foot away from the wall, lean back, and bend the other knee to strike a cool, James Dean pose. Note that this will leave your partner to do most of the work.
You might also want to have a seat. A bar stool or other tallish object is ideal for this. (Most normal chairs are so low that this will create a height discrepancy in the other direction, but then again, at least your partner will get to feel tall for a change.) If the situation is appropriate, pull your partner onto your lap and kiss each other sitting.;
, If your partner is a little bit taller, if they're comfortable they may let you stand on their feet. If you’re shorter, lean back a bit and reach up. Stand on your tiptoes if it's comfortable. If you’re taller, bend forward; while you’re at it, spread your feet apart a bit to not only make yourself shorter, but also give the other person a place to stand., Holding each other close will give you both leverage, making it easier to stay balanced and gauge which height to aim for.

When not kissing, the shorter partner in a hug may turn his or her head to the side and rest it on the taller partner's chest or shoulders.

, If it's appropriate to do so, kiss your partner on the forehead, neck, chest, arms, shoulders, hands, or belly. Not all good kisses land on the lips or cheeks!, Gone With the Wind contains some of the most famous onscreen kisses precisely due to the fact that Rhett was significantly taller than Scarlett; instead of trying to compensate for the discrepancy, he pulled her close, tilted her head back, and kissed her from above like an eagle swooping in on its prey. If you do this, make sure to hold the back of your partner’s head to make sure his/her neck doesn’t start aching. (Since this is an aggressive pose, tall gals might not want to do this to guys who are self-conscious about their height.)

If you’re short and your partner is strong enough, jump into their arms so that your faces are level, or do the ""Notebook” position by wrapping your legs around your partner’s waist and kissing them from above. This usually applies to a girl jumping into a boy's arms, but if the girl is strong enough, it might work the other way around with a bit of luck!






If you’re tall, lift your partner. While you’re at it, spin them around as an extra romantic way to kiss. You can also raise your partner slightly above you, allowing them to wrap their legs around you if necessary.

, If you know your partner had a long day at work, invite him or her over to you for a long, relaxing back or foot massage. You can even add some lotion or oils to make it extra romantic and sexy.

, It's likely that most of your photos are online. Print out the special ones and make a small photo album for your loved one to give him or her a physical reminder about how much you mean to each other. You can even write funny captions for the photos in the album to make the gift more silly and meaningful

, Who says you need to wait for a Hallmark holiday to tell your loved one how you feel? Pick a random night to celebrate Valentine's Day -- complete with a card, a nice dinner, and a long, loving night. This will be a very romantic move that will surprise and delight your partner.

, Dedicate a song to your loved one on the radio and make sure he or she is listening at the right time. You can also declare your love by writing a poem to your loved one and wrapping it around a bottle of wine. You can even serenade your loved one in a public place -- as long as this doesn't embarrass him or her. There are dozens of ways to come up with romantic ideas that are old-fashioned but not corny.

, You can be romantic by showing your loved one how much you care in a silly way. Take him/her to a county fair, hold his/her hand, and win him/her a silly stuffed animal. Go mini-golfing and write ""I love you"" at the bottom of the score sheet. Go to an amusement or water park together and have fun acting like lovesick teenagers.

Give physical affection to your loved one.,
Give new compliments.,
Keep looking sharp.,
Never stop the courtship.,
Be spontaneous.,
Make your bedroom more sexy.,
Be romantic in the bedroom.,
Spend some time apart.,
Explore the outdoors.",How to Be Romantic3," If you're more touchy-feely with your loved one, you're more likely to feel romantic -- and in the mood. No matter how long you've been together, you should cuddle, kiss, and show your loved one affection often enough to make that person feel truly loved.


You don't have to hold hands all the time, but if you're going for a walk, hold your loved one's hand.
If you're watching a movie, put your arm around your loved one, or snuggle up next to him or her.
Don't let a day go by without kissing your loved one, even if it's just a peck on the lips.
Hug your loved one as often as you can.
Think of new ways to give your loved one affection. It can be by tickling him or her in bed, gently stroking his/her hair, or by squeezing his/her side.

, To keep things fresh, you should not only give your loved one compliments whenever you can, but you should think of new and exciting compliments to give your loved one to make him or her feel truly special. Though you can go back to the same old compliments -- the beautiful color of your wife's eyes, or your new boyfriend's sexy smile, you can also mix things up by thinking of something new to appreciate about your loved one.


Find one new thing to compliment your loved one about each week. It could be a physical trait, or an aspect of his or her personality. Thinking of something new will also make you find even more things to appreciate about your special someone.
You can write the compliment in a note that you leave for your loved one to find. That will be even more romantic.

, If you want to keep the romance alive, you have to keep things fresh by always attending to your looks. If you've been with the same person for years, you can start to get lazy, wear sweatpants all the time, and forget to shower or shave, but that's not the way to go if you want to keep things romantic. Try to pay as much attention to your looks as you did when you first met the person you love.



Groom daily. Shower, shave, wash your hair, and do whatever you have to do to keep looking fresh.
Continue to dress up for date night. Even if it's your 500th date night, you should keep things fresh by always attending to your looks.
Try out a new haircut, style of makeup, or a new set of clothes you never normally would wear. Keep things feeling fun and different.

, Pretend that you and the person just met, and you want the person to fall for you. What would you do to impress him or her? To show him or her that you're interested? To win your loved one over? Treat your partner like he or she is single, like you're trying to earn his or her affection and trust.


The opposite of being romanced is being taken for granted. No one wants to feel like he or she has already been ""caught"" and it's over and done with. Put on a show! Stay on your toes!
The most romantic ideas come to people when they fear they might lose the one they love. But you don't have to actually be on the verge of losing someone in order to tap into that mindset.

, Many people associate the beginning of a relationship with romance, excitement and inspiration because everything is new. You've just met this person and the relationship is unfolding--what will happen tomorrow? Next week? Next month? Will he/she call? Will we kiss? Will he/she visit? But after the relationship is established, we settle into a routine, and nothing is new anymore.


To be romantic, to reintroduce the excitement that characterized the beginning of the relationship, do something different, something that your partner wouldn't expect. The more out of the ordinary, the better!
Take your partner on a weekend trip out of the blue, stop him or her in the middle of the street for a long, lingering kiss, or mail a letter to your partner listing all of the reasons you love him or her -- even if you live at the same address.

, If you make your bedroom more sexy, you'll feel more excited about getting frisky with your loved one. Make sure your bedroom is a den for sex and excitement, not a place for you to throw dirty clothes or old food wrappers, or a room that doubles as an office or a playpen for your children.


You and your loved one can work together to make your bedroom more simple and more sexy, leaving you no option to do anything other than sleep or make love in the bedroom.
Even working together to ""sexify"" your bedroom can make you feel more romantic and sexy.

, Whether you've been sleeping with the same person for years or just getting past the kissing stage in your relationship, you should always make things romantic in the kissing or love-making department. Never forget to look into your loved one's eyes, to tell him or her how much he or she means to you, and to deliver fresh compliments when you're kissing or just snuggling.


Don't just cut to the chase -- take the time to make the other person feel loved or appreciated.

, Though it may not feel very romantic to spend time apart from the person you love, spending some time apart, even if it's just a weekend away or a longer period of time, will help you remember why you love each other and will make you miss and appreciate each other even more.


Making time to hang out with your friends separately will help you appreciate your date nights together even more.
While you're apart, you can even both make a list of all of the things you miss about each other. That will be very romantic.
If you're apart for a few weeks or even longer, then you can write each other letters -- along with or instead of calling and emailing -- that say how much you mean to each other.

, Exploring the outdoors can make any couple feel romantic, whether you're nature lovers or not. Even taking a walk together every morning can make you feel more romantic, and so can going on a short hike, walking along the beach, or spending an afternoon picnicking or hanging out in a park.


Make sure to spend at least one day a week doing something outdoorsy together.
Even enjoying a home-cooked meal on your balcony or on your back porch can make you feel more romantic.
Watching a sunset together is always romantic no matter where you are.

Do activities that raise your adrenalin.,
Build up your self-esteem.,
Pursue new romantic interests together.,
Always tell each other how you feel.",How to Be Romantic4," Make time to do some activities that raise you and your loved one's adrenalin, whether it's taking a brisk walk, doing yoga, or going to the gym together. When your adrenalin is pumping, you will feel more sexy, and more romantic, about being with your loved one. If you and your loved one don't regularly exercise together, try to do something that raises your adrenalin together at least once a week.


Even walking to dinner instead of driving will raise your adrenalin.
Take a dance class together. Not only is that romantic, but it will get your blood pumping.

, If you and your loved one have high self-esteem, you will not only feel better about yourselves, but you'll feel better about each other and your relationship, and will therefore feel more romantic. Some ways to improve your self-esteem are to excise regularly, eat a healthier diet, and to build your confidence by taking the pride in the things you do and the things that make you special.


You and your loved one can also build one another's confidence by praising and complimenting each other.
Take pride in making and reaching your long and short-term goals. This will help you build self-esteem as well.

, If you want your relationship to grow and to continue to be romantic, then you and your loved one should pursue new interests that are romantic together. This will keep your relationship feeling fresh and will give you new things to look forward to together. Here are some romantic interests that you can pursue together:


Take a salsa, ballroom dancing, or a tap-dancing class together.
If you're musically inclined, write a duet together and practice performing it.
Take a ceramics or painting class together.
If you both love to write, write romantic sonnets to each other.
Make stargazing a hobby. Have fun exploring the stars together -- along with your loved one's dreamy eyes.
Learn to cook together. Have fun cooking a tasty and sexy Italian meal together, and enjoy sipping wine and listening to jazz as you do it.

, If you really want to grow as a couple, then you should always tell each other how much you love each other, and how special the relationship is to you. No matter how stressed out, annoyed, or cranky you may feel, you shouldn't let a day go by without acknowledging how much the other person means to you.



You should always say ""I love you"" if you mean it, no matter what.

Assemble the materials.,
Choose the location of your fort.,
Hang the pole.,
Hang the fabrics.,
Hang the other hooks.,
Decorate the fort.",How to Build a Love Fort1," To build this love fort, you will need the following items: 5 sheets, a few blankets, one pole, 4 screw hooks, 1 spool of twine, 4 large safety pins, lots of pillows, a tape measure and scissors.If you don’t have a pole, substitute an old shower rod or broom stick.
You can also substitute large pieces of fabric or sarongs in place of your sheets.;
, Pick an area that is fairly large and clear of furniture (you may have to rearrange your furniture to make this work). If you want people to see your fort, pick a high traffic area, like your living room.If you prefer to make your fort more private, you may choose to build it in your bedroom.
This fort does not lend itself well to being built outside.

, Measure the pole. Screw two of the hooks into the ceiling so they are the same distance apart as the length of the pole. Cut two 3-foot long pieces of twine and use this twine to hang the pole from the screw hooks.Use the twine to tie a knot around one of the screw hooks. Then tie the other end of twine around the pole.
Repeat this for both sides of the pole.

, Beginning with the heaviest sheet, layer the sheets and fabrics over the pole, creating a tent-like shape. When all the sheets are layered, measure 2 feet down from the front of the pole and safety pin all the sheets together.Make sure to safety pin the sheets on the other side of the tent as well.
If you'd like the fort to be a little more private, add additional sheets and blankets to fill in the walls.

, Cut two pieces of 3-foot long twine and tie a piece to each of the two safety pins. Screw the two remaining hooks into the ceiling about 2 feet from either side of the pole.Tie the two pieces of twine attached to the safety pins to the two new screw hooks in the ceiling.
This will help redistribute the weight of the fort, plus it will give it some more of its shape.

, Fill your fort with pillows and blankets for coziness. To make your fort more romantic, add chocolates and champagne. Make a heart garland by cutting heart shapes out of newspapers and using a needle and thread to string them together.Hang your garland over the sides of your tent.
Try making a pom-pom garland by stringing pom-poms on a fishing wire, using a needle. Layer your pom-pom garland over your newspaper garland.

Be respectful of their answer.",How to Cope With Romantic Feelings for Your Roommate," It may be that you are feeling grateful and happy that you have a roommate that you can share living space and expenses with, as well as a good friend that you can confide in. If you give yourself a month or two to just let those feelings be, you may find that they dissipate back to feelings of friendliness.Think about the reasons you want to date your roommate. What is it about them that you find attractive? Do you have the same values and beliefs? If you have legitimate reasons for wanting to date them, that’s one thing. On the other hand, if you just like the thought of having someone who’s always there physically and emotionally, then it’s probably not a good idea.;
, You may have the urge to simply tell them how you feel, and it may come to this eventually. However, at first, you really need to give yourself time to see where your feelings are coming from.If you do end up needing to tell them how you feel, then having taken the time to examine your feelings will mean that you can express yourself rationally and clearly.

, When we have a crush on someone, it can sometimes be difficult to talk to them without feeling like we are giving ourselves away. Try to keep everything as normal as possible.


Keep up the same habits as you normally would, too. If you start behaving strangely, your roommate may think something is up, and they may even think that they have done something wrong.
Remember that this step is not meant to be a long-term solution. Keeping things as normal as possible will give you time to think about your feelings and time to decide what to do without shaking things up, and forcing you to make rash decisions.

, What you end up doing about your feelings for your roommate should depend on whether or not you believe those feelings are mutual. Look for signs that your roommate has feelings for you. If you don’t think the feelings are mutual, you may still end up wanting to tell them how you feel, but without hope that they might reciprocate.


Be honest with yourself. When we have feelings for someone, we tend to see what we want to see. If it is unclear to you whether or not your roommate has feelings for you, chances are they don’t.What is your roommate’s body language telling you? When you talk, do they touch you a lot? For example, do they often laugh and touch your arm? When they talk to you do they give you their full attention, or do they talk to you without looking at you? A person who is interested will make a lot of eye contact, and will want to give you their full attention.Do they have a boyfriend or girlfriend, or do they have someone that they talk about a lot? If they are already in a relationship, it would be unfair of you to impose on that relationship. If they have a person they are constantly talking about or if they have told you that they are interested in someone else, then it is a pretty good sign that they’re not interested.

, This refers to your options in terms of moving out versus staying in the apartment. Can you afford to move out? Do you know where you will go? Could you find a new roommate if they choose to move out themselves? If you aren’t able to afford moving out, it is probably best to keep your feelings to yourself, at least until you figure out where you will go.


If you tell your roommate about your feelings, they may decide that they want to move out themselves. They might also ask you to move out. If you’re convinced that you absolutely cannot keep your feelings to yourself, then you need to be prepared for this reality.
Would you be able to afford your share of the rent for the remainder of the lease, in addition to a new apartment? If not, would you be able to find a suitable replacement roommate to take over your share of the rent?, Whether or not you decide to tell your roommate about your feelings, it is a good idea to have an exit plan in the event your feelings begin to cause you stress and anguish. If you do decide to confess your feelings, having an exit plan is important because you will need to be clear that you are prepared to move out, it that is their desire.What is the housing situation like where you live? In some bigger cities, the rental market is very competitive, making finding an apartment extremely challenging and expensive. Know the reality of the situation, and how long it might realistically take you to find a new apartment.
Ask to stay with a friend or with family. This might be an option for you if you will need a bit of time to find a new place, and if staying in the apartment will cause too much stress and awkwardness. If you can find a friend or family member to stay with for a few weeks, you will have some time to look for a new place, as well as some space to deal with your feelings.
Contact the university housing department. If you live in university housing, you should contact them to see what your options are. This department is set up to make sure you have a good experience in your dorm, and they will probably be willing to help however they can if you explain the situation to them. You will need to be honest with them. Explain that you have developed romantic feelings for your roommate, and that you haven’t decided what to do about those feelings yet, but that you want to be prepared to move out if necessary.

, You may want to search for another place to live for several different reasons. If you have developed romantic feelings for your partner that aren’t going away, consider finding a new place.If you tell your roommate about your feelings for them, and they reciprocate, then having your own space will give the new relationship the breathing room it needs to develop.
If you tell your roommate about your feelings, and they don’t feel the same, then moving out will give you space to move on, and avoid awkward encounters with them, and the people they may date in the future.
If you don’t tell them about your feelings, moving out will make it less awkward if you do decide to tell them. It will also give them space to think about how they feel about you.

, If you haven’t told them, you can still be honest by saying, “The truth is, that I’ve developed feelings for you, and I think it’s best to move out so I can have some space to deal with them.” If you don’t want to tell the truth, then make something up. If you want to remain in contact with them, and maybe move to the next level, then try to make them understand that it isn’t anything to do with them.


If you want to make up an excuse, you could say, for example, that you are having a hard time with the rent, and you found a cheaper place.
You could use distance to work or school as an excuse, as well.
If you can afford a place of your own, you could also say that you just want to have a space that is completely your own.
Do this in person. If your roommate doesn’t know you have feelings for them, they may be very surprised by your announcement. Try to be delicate, and avoid making them feel like it is their fault, if at all possible.

, If you don’t already have a place to go, then give yourself a deadline to be out of the apartment. Depending on where you live, and how difficult finding a new place is, this could range from weeks to months. This will also give them a chance to look for a new roommate, or move out themselves, if that’s what they want to do.Be strict on this deadline. Tell your roommate by what date you will be out, so that they have time to find a new roommate too. Telling them the date will also keep you true to your decision.

, If you do move out, regardless of the circumstances, try to stay on good terms. It isn’t your roommate’s fault that you have developed feelings.This doesn’t mean you have to stay in contact with them if it doesn’t work out how you want, but you should try to avoid making them feel like they did something wrong.

, If, for whatever reason, you feel it is best to simply hide your feelings, then you’ll need to accept that you will only ever be just friends. By doing this, you will be able to maintain your friendship and your living situation.Be aware though, that hiding your feelings for a long time may be painful and difficult for you to deal with. At some point, it is very likely that you will need to find another way to deal with your feelings. Either by confessing them, or by moving out to get some space.
Remember that feelings are fleeting. It may take time, but eventually you will find someone else to be attracted to, or someone might come out and confess their feelings to you. Be patient with yourself.
Don’t blame your roommate. This will cause feelings of resentment. It isn’t your roommates fault that you developed feelings for them, and it isn’t your fault that you developed them. Don’t be too hard on yourself, and don’t be angry at your roommate. Simply try to accept that feelings have developed.
If you do develop feelings of resentment that you can’t cope with, then it may be time to consider moving out.

, If you want to keep your feelings to yourself, it may be good to create a bit of distance between the two of you, which will give you time to cool off. However, don’t try to create so much that it strains your relationship.For example, if you and your roommate always hang out alone together, try to bring some other people into the mix so that it isn’t so intimate.
Try to avoid doing things that feel “date” like. Don’t go to the movies, dinner, or concerts alone together. This will only encourage your desire, and cause even more confusion.

, Spend time with your own friends, or find a new hobby. Try finding a part-time job that will get you out of the house or spend more time studying in the library. Not only will engaging in activities outside the house be good for you, it will also help you put your feelings in perspective, and may even help you get over those feelings.You could try online dating to meet other people. Not only will you have something to do outside the apartment, you might meet someone who you find even more attractive than your roommate.

, You can do this by sitting them down and telling them straight out, or you can wait for a moment that feels like a way to do it more subtly.You can do this in person or over the phone, but avoid doing it via text message or email. Sending a text or email will leave you waiting in anguish in response. If they don’t want to deal with it, they may even ignore it completely leaving you wondering if they received your message at all.
When you confess your feelings, include an offer to move out. For example, you could say, “I want you you to know how I feel, and I also want you to know that I respect your space. If you don’t feel comfortable living together anymore, I will move out, and I won’t blame you at all.”
If you want to tell them outright, ask if you can have dinner or lunch together outside the house (this will keep it more neutral for both of you). Tell them that you have something important to tell them, and that you hope that, regardless of the outcome, you can still be friends. Explain that it is important for you, and that you can figure out what to do about it together. Be prepared for the fact that they may not feel the same.
If you’d rather wait for an opening, then wait for a time when your roommate is complaining about dating, and that everyone they meet is awful for one reason or another. Then say something like, “Why not give me a chance?”, at this point, they may think you are joking. Reassure them that you are serious, and maybe add something like, “I’d really like to take you out for a date.”

, In either scenario, your roommate may say they need some time to think. Give them this time, and while they are mulling it over, try to keep it light and casual when you do see them. This way they can be sure that they can be honest about their feelings.Do your best to stay out of their way. Let your roommate know that you want to respect their need for time to think, and let them know you’ll be spending a few days at so-and-so’s house. If that’s not possible, do your best to stay out of the apartment as much as possible, and when you are at home, try to stay in your room whenever possible.

, Hopefully, they won’t make you wait too long for an answer, but be patient. You can hope that they will give you the response you want, but be prepared for the reality that they might reject you, and may even ask you to move out. Whatever they say, be respectful. If they feel the same, great! Congratulations! However, you now need to talk with your new lover about how you should proceed. Most importantly, whether or not you will remain roommates, or if one of you will move out. At this point, you should also talk about how you can deal with things in the (hopefully unlikely) event that it doesn’t work out.
If they don’t feel the same, then be graceful. Don’t yell or cry. Say something like, “That’s too bad, but I understand.” If this happens, you need to figure out where you can get over your feelings while still living with them, or whether you need to move out. Either way, you should try to talk about the next steps with your roommate.
If you do get rejected, try to remind yourself that at least now you know. You can at least feel the relief of having found out for sure.

It's also a great way to transition into just about any bedroom activity, from foreplay to a serious talk. Go slow on this step. Snuggle for a long time, at least 20 minutes, before moving on to other activities. Use the time instead to talk and caress their body gently, stroking their hair and running your finger along their collar-bone.


When you're snuggling is also a great time to talk about your relationship and your future, which can be really romantic for partners that have been together almost a year or more.
Really, you can talk about anything you want to talk about. However, talking about needing to go to the grocery store on Saturday isn't very romantic. Just keep that in mind.
Don’t schedule romance in bed or just outright say that you want to go have sex. Being romantic means being subtle, so you’ll need to either wait until you’re in bed as normal or find another way to get them in bed and set the tone for romance. Try flirting and then taking their hand and leading them to the bed.;
, If you think you've got kissing mastered and there's no room for improvement, think again. Everyone can always stand to get better with their technique and execution can be everything. Don't discount kissing and making out: both can be very romantic. Break the mold in terms of the kisses you're giving your partner right now in favor of something new and exciting.


Get creative with your kisses. Kiss every freckle and mole. Put on lipstick and “draw” a heart with kisses. There are lots of ways to making kissing more romantic, sexy, and memorable.

, Giving your partner a massage is a goldie but oldie when it comes to being romantic. Massages are very relaxing and a great way to lead in to other romantic activities.You don't even need to be very strong. A light touch in just the right places will still feel just as good.


Try putting a bottle of massage oil (or baby oil, if that's easier to find) in a bowl of warm water and warm up your hands before putting the oil on their skin. The warm sensations will get the massage off on the right foot.

, The vast wonderland hiding under our street clothes is a space generally reserved specifically for ourselves and our partners. When you give them a treat to find under your clothes, you can really take them by surprise, especially if you're not the sort of person that usually does that kind of thing.


You can wear sexy lingerie, write a love note in permanent marker, or get creative with your shaving routine (turning your pubic or chest hair into a heart shape, for example, but admittedly not for everyone).
This means you’re going to want to go the extra length on your clothes and underwear too. Pass on the ratty stuff with holes and stains and go for something that’s appropriate for the mood.

, If you've not been partaking in foreplay up to this point, now is the best time to start. If your foreplay has been a little...one sided, now is the time to turn the tables. By throwing all of your attention into your partner's pleasure, you'll really grab their attention. And their gratitude.


For help with women, try this article. A good form of foreplay for women is oral sex, since this is the most effective form of stimulation for her anatomy.
For help with guys, try this article. A good option for turning your guy on is wearing sexy underwear and letting him discover it slowly, like unwrapping a Christmas present.

, The best place to start is by just telling your partner how you feel. You don't need to worry about being really eloquent or coming across as cheesy. As long as you speak from the heart and are honest about your feelings, your partner will be very touched. Tell them what they mean to you and what your life feels like when they're in it. This will make them feel great and help set a really romantic mood.


For example, you can say something like, ""When I'm with you everything feels like coming home after being completely lost. When I'm with you, I feel like I have my compass. I'll never be lost again.""

, You can also try the traditional route and use romantic songs, poems, and quotes to get them feeling all warm and fuzzy. This works particularly well if you use words from something that means a lot to them. Quoting one of their favorite romantic moments from a movie, memorizing their favorite poem, or singing them their favorite love song are all great ways to get your romance on. Just be careful not to be cheesy!


Good classic poems to recite include Shakespeare's ""Sonnet 116"" or E.E. Cummings ""somewhere i have never traveled, gladly beyond"".

, Talking about all the good things that you want for your partner gives you a great way to express your love in a way that really puts the focus on them. This is very romantic and will warm their heart with feelings of love and affection.


You can talk about how much you want them to achieve their dream or how much you want them to not have to worry about the things that they struggle with right now.
For example, you can say something like, ""I really want you to be able to travel the world and see all the things you're always telling me about...and I will do whatever I have to do to make sure you get that chance.""

, Telling your partner just how sexy they are can be hugely romantic. It's especially important when your partner doesn't really see themselves as a sexual creature or someone that's desirable, because when you show them that you do think of them this way then they start to feel better about themselves. By showing them how sexy you think they are, they'll become more comfortable and have a better time in the bedroom.


Say something like, ""You look so hot like that. I feel like a teenager again...""

, We tend to write off sexy talk as not being very romantic but it certainly can be. Talking dirty and sexy opens up boundaries and brings the two of you closer together by giving you an easy way to talk about what you like and what you want. This can be key to making a relationship more fulfilling and longer-lasting.


Say something like, ""I love it when you do that with your tongue...""

, You can really knock your partner off their feet by transforming your bedroom into a romantic getaway. This is a great option for birthdays and anniversaries, but also as a ""just because"" gesture. Bring out the flower petals and scented candles for a traditional look or you can use props and decorations to create a theme.


For example, you can get incense, fabrics, pillows, and maybe a quick new coat of paint to give a room an Indian makeover before you show your partner just how much you can both learn from the Kama Sutra. You can also set a soundtrack to further the scene. Try anything by Ravi Shankar or try Anoushka Shankar if you want something a little more modern and sexy.
You can also buy fancy fabric to drape and hang from the ceiling and walls, transforming an unromantic room into a plush love-den.

, Chocolate body paint is a great way to get romantic (and delicious) with your partner. This body paint, easily picked up from sex shops or online retailers, lets you write love notes and play games using your skin and your tongue!


You can even make chocolate body paint yourself at home.

, Set up a sexy picnic in your bed with lots of foods that are fun to feed your partner. You can spoil them with peeled grapes, chocolate dipped strawberries, or spicy chocolates. Take turns feeding each other while you listen to sexy music. Before you know it, you'll be ready to eat each other up instead.

, Going to the movies is romantic but going to the movies by yourselves is even more romantic. However, not everyone can afford to rent out a whole theater for a single date. Skip the price tag and set up a theater in your bed instead. Drag the TV into your room or use a computer or laptop as your movie screen. Set everything up with popcorn and a candy stand, so that your partner feels like they're going to see a real movie.


It's a good idea to try to choose a movie which has significance to the two of you. Try to track down the first movie you ever saw together, for example.

, A unique way to get romantic in the bedroom is with couples photography or couples erotic photography. This is where you get pictures taken of you in the bedroom, in a romantic setting. This may include the two of you naked or even fully clothed. It's up to you but having sexy, romantic pictures of each other will be great to gave around. It also creates associations in your mind, between being in your bed and the excitement and feelings of the photo shoot.


You can find photographers that specialize in this kind of photography or you can do it yourself. Of course, it will be hard to get pictures of the two of you together that way but you can take lots of sexy pictures of each other without the discomfort of having another person in the room.

Have a girls' night.",How to Charm a Girl," Self respect, whether we realize it or not, is one of the first things we look for when seeking out healthy relationships. You show your self respect in how you take care of and present your body. Bathe regularly, use deodorant, and generally do things like wearing clean, unwrinkled clothes. You should also exercise to keep your body strong and healthy.


You should also show your self respect in your actions. Don't talk down about yourself and speak up for yourself when you're with other people.;
, No matter what you've got to start off with, you can make your body look even better by carefully curating what you wear. Wear clothes that fit, first of all: they shouldn't be too tight or too big. You also want them to accentuate good features and play down bad ones. Get those pants back on your butt, she wants to see your drawers later, not now. Next, figure out what colors look good on you. Depending on your mixture of hair and skin colors, as well as minor factors like eye color, different colors will look better or worse on you.


For example, wear pants with vertical pinstripes, because they'll make you look taller and thinner.
For choosing colors, you generally want to create contrast. If you have light skin, then darker colors will look better on you (just don't wear all black all the time). If you have dark skin, then light or brighter colors will look better on you.

, You don't have to have the best bone structure in the world in order to look like her Prince Charming; just a little facial care can do the trick! Make sure you're shaving correctly in order to fight shaving bumps and cuts. Do some basic maintenance by plucking wayward eyebrow hairs. You should also moisturize your skin, no matter how girly it seems. Moisturizing will make you look healthier, which naturally makes you more attractive.


Don't forget to fight acne, if you have it. A good cleaning regimen is often all you need to significantly reduce the acne problem that you have, but medicinal help is also available.
Try using makeup! We know, we know, but hear us out: makeup is designed to make your skin look better and healthier. It covers up all the problems with your skin. You don't have to do too much either. Using a wrinkle filler will make your skin look smooth, covering acne scars and large pores. Go over the top of that with a foundation gel stick and you'll be able to create a healthy look with little effort.

, Having a good haircut can totally change your whole looking, taking you from creeper-on-the-street to Michael Fassbender-like stud before you know it. Hairstyles compliment our natural features by playing up the parts that looks good, helping to hide the parts that look bad, and creating illusions that seem to give our face a whole new shape. See a hairstylist and get their recommendation to find a hairstyle that works for you.

, Spend some time in front of the mirror and practice your smile. You may find that your natural smile might be a bit off-putting. Try smiling in different ways until you find one that looks better. Some people look better with a closed mouth smile, some look better with one row of teeth, some look better with all teeth bared. It just depends on your face.

, Talent is very charming. Not every talent will impress every girl, but no matter what talent you have it's bound to charm at least one girl. You can develop and show off a talent you already have, or you can pick up a new one.


Good talents to pick up include playing the piano or guitar, drawing, or dancing.
You can find excellent primers on many of these talents right here on wikiHow!

, An absolute passion for life and an enjoyment of what you have tends to charm the socks off most girls. Be positive and focus on all of the great things that you have. Pursue the things that you want to have in your life. And never hide how happy you are when you are enjoying something that matters to you.


You should also show some ambition. Want things for your life. Want more than what you have and work for it, while still appreciating what you do have. She'll like this quality in you.

, Girls want to be with someone who encourages them and makes them feel more hopeful about what they can do and what they can have. We all do, right? When she clearly enjoys something, encourage her to pursue it or do it more. When she mentions a dream she has for the future, encourage her and help her to pursue it!


Sometimes, this might mean helping her with homework or at least keeping her company (and focused!) while she studies.
Never judge her dreams or make her feel like they're small or worthless. This is the opposite of charming!

, Girls like to see how much you care. Being guarded with your feelings may help keep your mates from teasing you, but it mostly just makes girls feel like you don't really like them. When you show her how much you care, especially in front of your mates and other women, she'll be totally smitten.


Tell her you love her or bring her flowers when other people are around.
Linger when you hug her or hold her hand. Sing a little after a kiss. These are great private communicators of feelings.

, Look at her eyes when you talk to her. Say her name in conversations, both with her and with others. Be loyal and don't worry about attracting other girls by being flirty or dressing to the 9s. Keeping your focus 100% on her tells her that your feelings are true.


Make comments to the effect of ""I'm not interested in attracting any more girls. I have you"". This shows that you're really just interested in her.

, Never assume that you are entitled to her affection, even if you're dating her. When girls feel like they have to give you their affection, like it's an obligation, then the whole thing quickly loses its romance. Work every day to earn her love and before you know it, you will.

, Putting others in the spotlight and highlighting the accomplishments of other people shows that you're a team player. It tells her that you're not selfish and that you could share a life with her, just like you share your happiness with others.


Instead of turning conversations to be about you, talk about what other people (especially her!) are doing instead.

, Being kind to her is obvious, right? Of course you want to be nice to her if you want to charm her. But you should also be nice to others as well. When you're mean to other people or talk about them behind their back, she'll start to wonder if you do the same to her or how long it will be until you turn on her. That isn't very charming!



Be friendly with people who struggle socially. One good way to show how kind you are to others is to be friendly and social with those who aren't good at making friends. This is especially effective if you're popular.

Be nice to people who are usually harassed, like homeless people, waiters, or door-to-door salesmen. When you're kind to the people that almost everyone is rude to, that sends a real message.

, A handmade gift shows her that you care and are willing to take time and effort to do something that you might not be very good at. You'll find loads of ideas online for gifts you can make by hand. Try browsing the wikiHow craft category or try Pinterest to get some inspiration. Otherwise, you can try:



Making her a necklace. Make her a necklace using a shell from your trip to the beach or find another pendant that reminds you of happy times that you've had together.
Making her a custom journal. Use ticket stubs, receipts, and other items from dates you've got on and other things you've done together and using a flat glue like Modge Podge, attach them to the cover of a journal. If you think she wouldn't use a journal, you can also get a plain keepsake box from a craft store and decorate that instead.

Making her a mix CD. For those with absolutely terrible craft skills, you can make her a mix CD that chronicles your experience of the relationship through songs.

, Even if you don't posses the singing prowess of Michael Jackson, singing her a love song that means something to you (or both of you) will totally charm her. If you're a good singer it will totally play on all her Disney princess childhood dreams. If you're an okay-to-bad singer, it will show that you don't care how bad you look, you just want to show her how much she means to you. It's a win win.


Try singing her ""Unchained Melody"". This is an easy song and is fairly easy to pull off for even the most untalented singers.

, Whether it's her lonely grandma or her favorite sister, going out of your way to make the day of someone that's very important to her will really make her happy. You can try making and having a nice meal with her grandmother or help her dad clean up the backyard, for example.

, Write little love messages on Post-It notes and leave them everywhere, hiding them wherever she goes frequently. You can even hide them in locations that she might not find for awhile. You can put the messages in her drawers, books, purse, on her cellphone, in the kitchen cabinets, under her pillow, and in any other location you can think of.


Write things like ""I love kissing your forehead when you come home"", ""My favorite time of day is waking up to you"", ""Being your knight in shining armor is my greatest honor"".

, Some guys give their girlfriends back rubs (which is lovely, don't get us wrong) but you're going to go the extra mile, because she's worth it. Get some massage oils and heat them up by placing the container in a bowl of warm water. Then put on some soothing sounds or music, light some candles (make sure to keep them away from the oils!), and give her a total body rub down. If you don't know how to give a good massage, that's okay: wikiHow has your back.


You can try MyNoise for great spa-like sounds.

, When she's having a really tough time, such as if something went really wrong at work or she lost someone important to her, start by taking all of the pressure off of her. Do all the cleaning, cooking, and other stressful activities for a day or two until she can recover.If you want to be super sweet, when you are sick, sneeze on her. I know, it sounds gross. However, when she gets sick, it would be a good time to give her a spa treatment. She'll think it's adorable. At the same time, do what you can to help her see that there are good things in life too. You don't want to diminish the situation by trying to joke or distract her, but you should offer her the option in case she wants it.


For example, make and give her a coupon for a free movie date with you.

, Ask her throw down a challenge so that you can prove how much you love her. Have her challenge you to run 5 laps around the park or do 50 push ups. She might even take the opportunity to up the ante and ask you to fix something that's really been bothering her, like quitting smoking. Taking on the small challenges will bring a smile to her face and charm her, but taking on the big challenges will really prove how much you care. Just be aware that once she throws it down, you're going to have to follow through!

, It's fun for her to hang out with her girls but sometimes it can be extra special if she gets to do those same activities with the one she loves! Watch those girly movies that make her so happy, go together to get pedicures, and eat a tub of ice cream while she vents about her bestie. She'll be blown away that you're willing to set aside norms to have a good time with her.

If your bed does not have a headboard or posts, the twine should be high enough that both people could sit upright in bed.

, Drape the curtains over the top of the twine. The curtains should be pulled taut, so the fabric creates a canopy over the top of the bed.

But you are worthy of love. If you want to fight the doubts in your mind, start by building your self-esteem. Remember that you don't have to be perfect because no one is. You are amazing just the way you are. Remember all of the wonderful things you've done and the hardships you've made it through. You can do anything if you work hard at it and you can make the world a better place.;
, When you respect yourself, other people will follow. Take good care of yourself and treat yourself right. Take care of your body by practicing good hygiene and wearing clean clothes that fit your body. Don't talk down about yourself and don't let people push you around. This lets them know that you think you're worthy, and they'll start to agree.

, Passion, not necessarily romantic but passion for life, is very attractive to others. Loving something with all your heart, whether it's sports or writing (or whatever it is that makes you feel on fire), makes people feel hopeful and inspired. They want to be around you more because it makes them feel better about the things that they're passionate about. Pursue your passions and let other people see it. Even if you think your passions are silly.

, Your behavior is the main base of you. Smile and be approachable. Try to be happy as much as possible. When someone asks you something, respond to them politely and with respect. When you treat others with all respects they too do the same. Give respect to everyone you meet. Talk politely with elders so that your behavior will be praised by others.

, When a person is in need, don't hesitate to give them a hand. First, understand the problem, advise them about it, and discuss it with interest. Sometimes people don't like to get advice from others. If you try to help such people, they may think you're meddling. Only help people who need help and invite you to give them advice.

, Give people the chance to see how amazing you are. If you're good at something, even if it's something boring like organizing, let others see that. Don't be shy. Letting people see your talent isn't the same as showing off or bragging. Taking pride in what you've accomplished and patting yourself on the back for it is healthy.

, What do you want from this love you want to have? Do you just want a close companion like a best friend or do you want a romantic relationship? Sometimes when we feel like we want a romantic relationship, the problem would really be solved by a good friendship. Recognize that you don't have to be in a romantic relationship to feel loved and happy and consider if this would be easier than the complications of a romance.

, Why don't you feel loved right now? This is an incredibly important question. If you're loved and you just can't accept or feel like you're loved, then you need to fix that problem, not get more love. If you aren't being loved in the relationships that you're in, then you need to take a serious look at the people you love and decide if they're worth the effort. Some people are just jerks and you're better off without them. If they treat you poorly and don't love you, then you need to find someone new. You deserve better.

, Some people think that if they aren't showered in diamond rings and prompt birthday cards, then they aren't loved. But this really isn't true: people don't need to give you things in order to love you. And giving you things isn't a sign of their love, either. Make sure that you know what love looks like so that you can recognize it (or the absence of it) in your life.

, If you think that your feeling unloved could be related to depression or other mental health problems (or even abuse), please seek help. Find a trusted individual or even a doctor and get some professional assistance. We here at wikiHow want you to be happy and healthy.


Never feel like there's anything wrong with asking for or needing help with abuse or your mental health. You wouldn't feel ashamed of having the flu, so don't feel ashamed about this. It is not your fault and you did nothing wrong.

, If you want to create more opportunities for you to feel loved, a good place to start is by making some new friends. Try going out to clubs or take a class with your local community center.

, A community can be even better than a group of friends. Take up a local cause that is important to you, or join an online fan community (or even wikiHow!). These communities can be powerfully supportive and a great way to make your life better., A pet is another way to bring more love into your life. Our animals love us unconditionally and depend on us greatly. You can have a wonderful impact on an animal's life, especially if you get a rescue animal.

, Joining a church or other religious congregation can be a great way to find friends, a community and a strong support network. Find a congregation that shares your beliefs and try attending regular services and events.

, If you really think that what you need is a significant other, you can get a boyfriend or get a girlfriend. Just remember that sometimes these relationships bring on more problems than they solve.

, Volunteering is the best way for you to feel loved while having an incredibly positive impact on your community. You can volunteer everywhere from soup kitchens to hospice services and directly meet people who you help. You will find an incredible sense of fulfillment when you help others in a significant way. Give it a try today!

Embrace your right to say “no.” While many studies show that individuals who are open to vulnerability and accepting love from others tend to be happier and healthier people, you are not required to accept love from everyone.,
Learn to recognize when “love” is actually emotional abuse.",How to Accept Love," Self-compassion is the extension of acceptance and empathy to yourself. Self-compassion is crucial to your ability to love others and accept their love. According to researchers, self-compassion involves three elements:Self-kindness. We’re sometimes taught that being accepting and understanding toward ourselves is selfish or narcissistic, but think about it: if a friend made a mistake, would you constantly remind them of how horrible they are, or would you try to be understanding of their error? Extend yourself the same kindness you would to others.
Common humanity. It can be easy to believe you’re the only one capable of imperfections and guilt, but making errors and experiencing pain are part of what makes us human. Understanding that you’re not the only person to make mistakes or feel hurt can help you feel more connected to those around you.
Mindfulness. Mindfulness has a lot in common with meditation: it’s the idea of recognizing and accepting an experience, without judgment, as you experience it. For example, if you frequently have the thought, “I’m so unattractive, nobody will love me,” a mindfulness approach might be something like, “I’m experiencing the feeling that I’m unattractive. This is just one of many feelings that I will have today.” Recognizing when you are having negative thoughts will help you move your thoughts elsewhere.;
, We are often taught that accepting ourselves is self-indulgent or egocentric, or -- worse yet -- lazy. Instead, we are told that perfectionism and self-criticism are healthy and productive. In fact, they’re not; they are usually based in fear.Self-pity is different from self-compassion. Self-pity is the feeling of “poor me” that you may experience when things don’t go your way; for example, “My colleague got more of the credit for our project than I did. Nothing ever works out for me.” Self-pity focuses only on your problems and often creates feelings of inadequacy. A self-compassionate thought might be, “My colleague and I worked hard on that project, and I feel that I did a good job. I can’t control how others respond to our work.”
Self-compassion isn’t laziness. Accepting yourself doesn’t mean that you don’t want to improve yourself. It just means that you won’t be cruel to yourself when you make mistakes. Practicing expressing love for yourself also helps you express it to others.
Beating yourself up is not the same as accepting responsibility for your mistakes. A self-compassionate person can still own up to mistakes they make without feeling that he or she is a terrible person. Research has shown that self-compassionate people are actually more likely to attempt self-improvement., While these two sound similar, they have some crucial differences. Self-esteem is what you think and how you feel about yourself, and it’s important to being a healthy, happy person. However, it tends to be motivated by external validation: for example, you may feel attractive because someone compliments your looks. Self-compassion is about accepting yourself, flaws and all, and treating yourself with kindness and understanding.Psychology research has shown that self-esteem is not a reliable indicator of success or even capability. Sometimes, it’s the most confident people who know the least about a situation., Shame is the source of a lot of pain, and we’re very good at producing it. Shame is the profound, enduring belief that somehow, we aren’t worthy: of love, of time, of attention. However, shame is often not related to anything that is actually wrong with ourselves or our actions; it’s an internal judgment. Try to be aware of your thoughts and feelings about yourself. Sometimes shame manifests itself as feeling that you don’t deserve love. Sometimes it presents itself as a fear that if we reveal our true selves, the other person will leave us. These feelings are common, but they are also very damaging. Try affirming to yourself that you do deserve love.

, This doesn’t come naturally to most people, because we’re often trained to see criticizing ourselves as something positive (for example, it drives one to work harder, improve oneself, etc.). However, there are steps you can take to work on improving your ability to accept yourself.Point out your strengths to yourself. We’re used to making lists of failures, and humans tend to remember negative events and emotions more clearly than positive ones.Take some time each day to write down something positive about yourself. It doesn’t matter so much if you believe it at first. Make a habit of thinking about yourself in positive terms, and you’ll probably become less resistant to believing them.
Depersonalize your failures. It can be easy to think “I’m a failure” if you haven’t succeeded at something, but that kind of totalizing thinking devalues you and promotes feelings of shame. Instead, try thinking something like, “I didn’t succeed at _____, but I did the best I could.”
Remind yourself that you’re human. Perfectionism can have devastating consequences on the way we view ourselves. Try looking at yourself in the mirror and telling yourself: “I am a human being. Human beings are not perfect, and neither am I. That is okay.”

, Sometimes, you will do something that you didn’t want to do. Perhaps you scored badly on a test, or hurt a friend’s feelings, or lost your temper with your boss. However, dwelling on those negative occurrences and shaming yourself about them keeps you from viewing them as learning experiences.Instead, accept that whatever happened happened, apologize for it if you can, and come up with a plan of what you will do differently in the future.
Accepting your mistakes doesn’t mean pretending they didn’t happen. It doesn’t even mean not feeling bad that they happened. Taking responsibility for your actions acknowledges the mistakes, but focusing on what you can learn from them and how you can avoid them in the future transforms guilt into growth.

, People have many reasons for not being comfortable accepting love from others. For some, it’s just a trait of their personality that they’d like to change. For others, a history of abuse or trauma may have required that the person shut down to protect themselves, making trusting someone else enough to accept their love nearly impossible. Understanding why you are having trouble accepting love will help you overcome that difficulty.


Some people are naturally more reserved than others. Don’t confuse emotional reserve with inability to accept or express love.
If you have previously been in relationships that ended badly, or if you were in a relationship with someone who didn’t offer you the same love and trust that you offered them, it can be hard to think about accepting love again.
It is natural for survivors of abuse to experience an inability to trust others. Trust is a difficult thing to re-learn, so take your time. Don’t feel guilty because you have trouble trusting people.

, In order to achieve intimacy in relationships, whether they are with friends or with romantic partners, you need to be comfortable being vulnerable with the other person. It can be terrifying to accept this possibility, but researchers emphasize that without vulnerability human connection cannot happen.For example, much of what drives a classic “fear of commitment” is the fear of being vulnerable and then being hurt. This often stems from a history of past experiences.You can practice accepting vulnerability incrementally. Start with small gestures -- greeting a coworker, saying hello to a neighbor -- and accept that they may not be returned and that this is okay. You just need to practice putting yourself forward.

, Especially if you haven’t had a lot of practice in accepting love from others, or if you’ve been hurt by loved ones in the past, you may need to take particular care in choosing what love you’re willing to accept and what level of vulnerability you are able to handle at this point in time.


For example, accepting an offer to go out for coffee with a coworker may represent a fairly low level of vulnerability for some people, but a high level for others. Deciding to try healing a friendship that fell apart represents a very high level of vulnerability.
You may need to start with small steps at first. That’s okay. You can build up to accepting greater levels of vulnerability as you become more comfortable with accepting love.

, Being in a relationship with another person, whether it’s a colleague, a friend, or a romantic partner, means that you are connecting with unique person with feelings and thoughts of his or her own. You cannot, and should not, control other people’s actions and emotions, and trying to do so can end up hurting everyone in the relationship. Accepting that you can’t control the other person means accepting the possibility that they may hurt you, but it also means that you may find out how truly loving they can be when allowed to express themselves., Accepting yourself can be hard if the people you surround yourself with are constantly criticizing you or asking you to change. It will be much easier to accept love from friends and romantic partners who accept you for who you, do not constantly criticize or shame you, and do not set conditions on their love for you., Always remember that you can and should ask others to respect your boundaries.


The other person should respect the boundaries you set. People who routinely ignore or reject your requests may not be genuinely interested in your feelings.

, Sometimes, individuals attempt to control other people by manipulating their feelings of love. There are many forms that emotional abuse can take, but learning to recognize these warning signs will help you determine when the offer of love is something that will enrich your life and when it’s an attempt to manipulate you.A common abusive tactic is to make love conditional based on something that you do. This can manifest as manipulations such as “If you really loved me you would….” or “I love you, but…”
Another abusive tactic is to threaten the withdrawal of love to get a desired behavior; for example, “If you don’t do ____, I won’t love you anymore.”
Abusers may also play on your own insecurities to convince you to obey them, such as telling you that “nobody will love you the way I do” or “nobody will want you if I leave you.”
If you experience any of these in your relationship, consider seeking counseling or other assistance. Emotional abuse is not normal, and you don’t deserve it.

Don't leave evidence.",How to Kiss Your Girlfriend," You want to help ensure that your girlfriend is receptive to your kiss so take some basic preparation measures. Establish a good relationship and get to know each other a bit before moving on to kissing. This will make the kiss feel more satisfying. You should also time your kiss carefully. Don't do it when other people are around or in situations that aren't romantic.;
, Okay, you can't exactly cover yourself in strawberry lip gloss like she can, but you should still aim for those moist, slick lips. This makes kissing more comfortable. Keep hydrated and use a lanolin-based lip balm like Carmex a couple days before you kiss. If the kiss feels imminent, use a lip balm that tastes better.

, Fresh breath is a big deal. Brush your teeth regularly (don't neglect the tongue!) and touch up with a mint, gum, or breath spray soon before the kiss itself. Go for a flavor like mint, as flavors like fruit or cinnamon can go bad very quickly.

, Lean in and snuggle her, put an arm around her, pull her into an embrace, or get in the Kiss Zone.

, Placing your hands around her face, cupping that space between her jaw and ear, can help you keep aligned and give you more control over the kiss. It also makes it easier for you to guide yourself if you close your eyes too early.

, Lean in for the kiss but hesitate and look at her lips before actually planting the kiss. It doesn't sound like a good idea, but you do want to give her the opportunity to stop the kiss before you kiss her. She needs to know what is about to happen. This keeps you from getting slapped later.

, Before you go full in for that kiss, angle your head just a bit to one side or the other. This will save you from a war of the noses.

, When you kiss, don't kiss with aligned lips like you'd kiss your grandma. Instead aim to have her lower lip hit in the space between your lips. Take her lip just a little in your mouth, making the same motion as if you were finishing taking a bite of a banana.


Practice on your hand first. It's better for everybody.

, You'd be surprised how easy it is to forget. Let your lips leave hers for just a moment as you move from angling from one side to another and breathe nice and deep. It's a bit like swimming.

, When you kiss her, keep your lips loose. Avoid taut, puckered lips.

, Don't rush into that impassioned make out. Even the most experienced of kissers needs to learn the rhythm when kissing someone new. Take things slowly and sensually. Passionate kissing can be an experience for another day.

, You know how you cupped her cheeks earlier? This is when you can bring that back into play and turn her into make her heart just about melt. With your hands still cupped around her face, use your thumb to gently caress her cheekbones, following the curved line of the bone. Gently is the key word here.

, Yes, you do have to stop kissing at some point...if only to get some air! Don't worry, you can always kiss more later but you don't want it to get awkward.

, It's harder than it sounds to be really and truly good at making out, but you can learn how.

, This is often less complicated than it seems, so long as you do a little prep work and cover a couple of basic do's and don'ts.

, You don't want to be that terrible passionate kisser that basically eats the head of your girlfriend, so get some basic tips on passionate kissing before you totally gross her out.

, You do not want to pressure a girl into a kiss or do anything to make her feel uncomfortable. This shows basic respect and you shouldn't be kissing a girl you don't respect: you deserve to be with someone that you can see as an equal worthy of the highest respect and care! Pay attention to her reactions and the things she says, and don't feel like it's not okay to ask if she's okay. Make her happiness your goal!

, Serious public kissing is pretty gross for everyone that's not in the kiss, and in some places it might even get you in trouble! Save kissing for times that are private, no matter how hard you find it to keep your lips off of her.


Exceptions can sometimes be made for a single, quick peck, however. Just don't go overboard.

, If you haven't learned about hickies, you should do some research. Avoid leaving evidence of your kissing like this, as while a hickey can be a badge of honor for guys, it can spell trouble for girls. There is quite a societal double standard and for girls, hickies can mean getting harassed or even fired from their job."

Do some homework.,
Start looking and feeling good in advance.,
Pick your clothes early.,
Clean up on the day of the date.,
Think positively.,
Act like it is natural.",How to Prepare For a Date," In the days before a date, take time out to catch up with current events and hot topics. These are great conversation starters and you will be able to impress your date with your knowledge. Try to remember as much as you can about previous conversations together so you can follow up on them. Have a couple of funny stories or conversation pieces up your sleeve in case you need them. There are now many dating advice online forums and sites that one can access in the internet. The problem with some of these sites is that they are not actually made by professionals who have studied and researched their dating advice. It would be prudent to also consider the legitimacy of the dating advice as well as the veracity of it.;
, Set time aside for exercise in the days before the date, whether it's yoga or push ups. Eat well and get plenty of sleep.

, You should have several outfits laid out before the day of the date. This way you won't have any last minute panics when you realize you have a spaghetti stain down your favourite shirt. Plus, it will allow you to try on a few different looks on the day of the date and see which one fits your mood most comfortably at the time.

, Take a nice, long shower or bath. Ensure you have clean hair and nails. You should smell good, but not overpowering. Avoid heavy perfumes and aftershaves, especially if your date could be allergic. Ladies, go easy when applying make-up and aim for a natural but groomed look. If things go well he will eventually see you without make-up - and you will want him to recognize you at that point. Shortly before leaving for your date, floss and brush your teeth thoroughly.

, You're going out to enjoy yourself, after all. Don't start worrying about what disasters could happen, because that way they are far more likely to. If you are getting nervous, call a good friend, watch your favourite comedy show or listen to upbeat music. Loosen up. Focus on having fun and you inevitably will.

, Don't show that you're nervous. Being nervous will start things off on the wrong foot.

Mix it up.,

Leave the cuddling position if necessary.",How to Spoon Someone," In most spooning positions, you will need to designate a ""little"" and a ""big"" spoon:


The little spoon: This is typically the smaller partner. This position is often considered emasculating, and usually will fall to the feminine partner.
The Big Spoon: This will often be the dominant partner. This is typically the taller or more masculine partner.
A quick test to figure out which spoon is the big spoon: whoever hugs the other partner while cuddling should be the big spoon. These role aren't always black and white, quite often big spoons will enjoy occasionally being the little spoon.;
, In this position, The big spoon lies on his or her side, and the little spoon puts his or her back to the stomach of the big spoon while also lying on his or her side. While there are variations of what the bottom arm of the big spoon does in this position, it's well accepted within the spooning community that the big spoon's top arm should be wrapped around the waist of the little spoon.


See ""Avoiding Awkwardness"" below for information on what the big spoon can do with his or her bottom arm.

, In this technique, the big spoon lies on his or her side, and the little spoon puts his or her back to the stomach of the big spoon while also lying on his or her side. The little spoon should then curl into a fetal position. The big spoon should then use his or her bottom arm to stretch behind him or her, creating a cross, with the top arm lying across the little spoon.

, In this position, the big spoon lies on his or her side, and the little spoon should then curl into a fetal position facing the stomach of the big spoon. The big spoon should then hug the little or Baby Spoon with both arms.

, For this move, the big spoon should lie on his or her back. The little spoon should then lie on top of the big spoon's stomach, face down. For more intimacy, try hugging each other.

, To take the same idea behind the ""Classic Spoon,"" try interlocking both spoons' legs so that bottom leg of the big spoon rests on the mattress, then the little spoon's bottom leg, then the big spoon's top leg, then the little spoon's top leg.

, To do this maneuver properly, both the little and the big spoon should press their backs to each other's. This will allow for more personal space (and fresh air) while still providing the ""warmth"" of your partner.

, Who says the male has to be the big spoon all the time? Have fun switching it up and changing who is in the position of the big and little spoon. Even if the little spoon is a foot taller than the big spoon, this will be a fun and cute cuddling experience. If you and your partner are really comfortable with one another, then traditional gender and spoon roles won't matter!

, This is a crucial part to creating a lasting spooning position. This responsibility usually falls on the big spoon because it is likely his or her arm that will suffer the consequences. Bad arm placement can result in your arm falling asleep or an inability to leave the spooning position. Here are some arm positions you should avoid at all costs:



The T-Rex Arm happens when two people are spooning on their sides and the big spoon's bottom arm is caught behind the back of the little spoon creating a T-Rex arm (bent at the elbow) that has no room to expand.

Army Arm happens when two people are spooning on their sides and the big spoon's bottom arm is forced to be straight at their side. This is often uncomfortable and creates a barrier between the big spoon's front and the little spoon's back, therefore decreasing intimacy.

Superhero Arm happens when two people are spooning on their sides and the big spoon's bottom arm is forced to extend straight-up as if he or she were about to fly. While this allows the big spoon to put his or her arm under the neck of the little spoon, increasing intimacy, this can quickly lead to a dead arm and leaves little room for the big spoon to escape.

Hugging Arm happens when two people are spooning on their sides and the big spoon's bottom arm is wrapped around the waist of the little spoon. This can lead to the worst possible scenario: Big Spoon's arm falls asleep and Little Spoon's too comfortable to wake up and free the big spoon's arm. Amputation is then the only way to break free without waking your partner. If you do try to escape, try explaining why you woke your partner without sounding selfish (Hint: it's not going to happen).

, If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen (without offending your partner). Leaving the cuddling position breaks or ""ends"" the intimacy of the moment. Pulling out of the position, therefore, must be done in a diplomatic way. We all need some personal space sometimes, and it's perfectly natural to feel this way. Here are some ways to stop cuddling as gracefully as possible:



Fake it so you don't hurt your partner's feelings. Use a fake yawn or a casual sleep ""grunt"" to establish that you are ""doing this in your sleep"". This will establish that you are doing this while sleeping and not because they are a bad spoon. This will spare their feelings and prevent any confrontation. Once you create your escape noise, be sure to continue using it before and after you escape and then periodically. It's called establishing your baseline and this is going to make this a whole lot more convincing.

Do a limb block. The goal is to be able to roll out of the position. This means you will need a clear escape route that involves as little effort as possible––'you are doing this in your sleep. First remove any arms or legs by either:

Slowly move the limb yourself without waking them. To move a limb without your partner noticing, it's going to be a single, slow, and methodical motion. This is going to need to be done with your eyes closed. If the other person catches you, play ""asleep.""
Creating an uncomfortable situation for your partner that makes him or her move that limb. If you are experiencing issues with being able to move an arm or limb, or heaven forbid are the bottom spoon in a position, it's going to be best that you make your partner as uncomfortable as possible. Then when he or she moves, you are guilt-free.



Swiftly roll out. Roll over to an open space in the bed by tucking all of your limbs as close to your body as possible and then ""rolling"" in one motion to the free space. This is a commitment. Once you start to roll, you cannot abort the mission. This is a red-flag that you are awake. This will make it extremely obvious that steps one and two were purposeful and that you were trying break the ""intimacy"" that the spooning set out to establish.

Go on a long walk.,
Stargaze together.,
Check out cultural events in your town.,
Go out for dessert.",How to Plan a Romantic Evening on a Budget1," If the weather permits it, take a romantic walk around the neighborhood or go to a local park, beach, or nature preserve. Taking a walk will give you the chance to enjoy each other’s company while enjoying the scenery. It also might work up your appetite for dinner!;
, Head to the backyard or a local park with some type of ground covering, a laser pointer, and some geeky enthusiasm to look for constellations. You might even be able to watch a meteor shower.If it’s cold, bring extra blankets and maybe a warm drink in a Thermos.
If it’s warm, bring some lemonade and light snacks.

, Many towns and cities have an array of locally-sponsored cultural events. Many of these are free, to boost community spirit. Why not take advantage of them? Check local listings for ideas of fun things you can do, then plan your date around them.Many museums have frequent free nights. Who cares about holding hands at the movies when you can hold hands in front of a T.rex?
Parks often host free concerts and movie nights. You can find out together if you like bluegrass!
Fireworks displays don’t happen very often, but they’re special when they do. Bring along the same supplies you would for stargazing (blanket, snacks, and warm clothing if necessary) and enjoy.
Street fairs and festivals are a fixture in warm or moderate weather. You don’t have to buy anything--just walk around and enjoy.
Readings and lectures are often offered by colleges or bookstores. What could be more romantic than learning together?

, Dinner and drinks together can get really pricey, but sometimes you want the enjoyment of going out to eat. Buying an indulgent dessert from your favorite restaurant feels celebratory, and it’s a great way to split the difference. If you both want to, you can even split a large dessert. Also, make sure to leave your server a nice tip--it adds to the romance,"

Try not to ruminate.",How to End a Long Distance Relationship," Ask yourself why you want to break up with this person, and identify all of the things that make you unhappy in the relationship.


Make a list of the things that bother you. Is the distance the problem, or is your partner the problem? Consider whether you can change any of these things, or whether they are simply immutable side-effects of a long-distance relationship.
If you are undecided, make a list of positives and negatives: reasons to stay in the relationship, and reasons to leave it. Consider the weight of each point; one very powerful negative may negate a long list of positive aspects.;
, Consider whether you can resolve your frustrations by talking with your partner. If you are certain that you want to break up, then gather your resolve and make a plan.


If you are tired of the distance, but you still love your partner, consider talking to him or her about the future. Long-distance relationships tend to work best when there is a light at the end of the tunnel: when you and your partner are planning to close the geographical distance in the near future., If you need to bounce your thoughts off of someone, but you aren't ready to speak with your significant other about the problems in your relationship, consider seeking the advice of a close friend, family member, or counselor.


Lay out your grievances and explain why you are thinking about a break-up. Ask your confidante if your reasons are reasonable. He or she may validate your thoughts or help you see your situation in a new light.
If your confidante has experienced a long-distance break-up themselves, it may benefit you to ask for their advice. He or she may be able to give you valuable tips.

, Stop living under the shadow of a long-distance relationship. Open yourself up to the opportunities around you and consider what will make you truly happy.


If you think that you want to break up with someone, giving yourself a taste of life on the single side will help you make your decision. If you begin to disconnect from your long-distance partner, and you like it, it may be the right choice for you.
Try to meet new friends in your area. Consider joining a meetup group or attending free events around your city. Go exploring on your own, and don't think about the next time that you will speak with your partner. Do the things that your relationship has kept you from doing.
Live for yourself and own every moment of your day. You may find that taking these steps actually gives you room to breathe in the relationship.

, If you've agreed upon an exclusive relationship, but you want to see other people, it may be best to break up with your partner before you move on in a romantic sense. Be respectful.


If you cheat on a long-distance partner and they find out, they may be more likely to take the initiative and break up with you. However, the process may be exponentially more painful, and you will only prolong the situation.
If you are considering a break-up because you are already romantically involved with another person: you will need to choose, sooner or later. The sooner you choose, the less painful it will be for everyone involved.

, It's generally best to break up in person, if you can, so that your partner can get the closure that he or she needs. Show respect for the time and energy that you have both poured into this relationship.


This can be one of the hardest parts about ending a long-distance relationship. You may feel obligated to break up in person, but you have trained yourself to make the most of your time together. These visits can become a sort of fantasy--a vacation from everyday life--and it is difficult to break the pattern.
If you have plans to visit your partner soon, then take advantage of this visit. If you don't have anything planned, then consider going to visit them as soon as you can. You don't need to make up a reason, but it also may not be wise to inform your partner that you are coming to break up with them. Just go.
If you are holding on to any of your partner's possessions--say, his sweater, or her favorite book--this is a perfect opportunity to return them. Bring these things with you when you go.
Try to break up while you're visiting their town, rather than while they are visiting yours. This will make it easier for you to leave.

,


The troubles of everyday relationship life may fade into the background of a vacation, and you may find it more difficult to initiate the break-up. Once you return to your daily life, you may find that the same frustrations rise to the surface one again.
If you do break up with someone while on vacation, you may find yourself trapped in close proximity with an upset ex-partner for the duration of your stay.

, Try not to initiate the break-up in a public place with a high concentration of people, such as a restaurant, a coffee shop, or a bar. This may make the situation more intense.


Make sure that you can easily leave the space after you complete the break-up. Try not to leave any of your possessions in your soon-to-be-ex's home, where it may be awkward to retrieve them.
Consider initiating the break-up in a neutral, low-density public space, like a city park.

, Get it over with. Say, ""We need to talk. This relationship isn't working for me, and I want to break up.""


Lay out your reasons for ending the relationship. Be gentle and kind, but do not compromise. Speak honestly and speak from the heart.
For example: ""I can't handle the distance any more. It's eating me up and splitting me apart inside. You're a wonderful person, and I hope that you find someone who can give you what you need--but I can't be that person.""

For example: ""I don't see us winding up in the same city within the near future, and I don't want to keep pouring time and energy into something that isn't going anywhere. I wanted to do this in person, but this is it. It's over.""


, Do not make the break-up sound like a deal or a suggestion. Be sure of your resolve and be clear in your intentions.


Try to keep your explanation short and simple. The longer you linger, and the more you say, the more complicated the break-up may become. Words can tangle.
Try to avoid an argument. Don't accuse your partner of anything, and don't lay blame. Explain that the break-up is about you and your inability to stay emotionally invested in this relationship.

, Be patient and empathetic. Let your partner speak his or her side of the story, and listen.Stay for as long as it takes to help your now-ex along the path to closure. Be aware that he or she may not find peace immediately, depending on how emotionally invested he or she is in the relationship.
When there is nothing more to say, or if you feel that the conversation has become circular: wish your ex-partner the best, and leave.

, It's important to express your feelings as personally as possible so that your partner can get the closure that he or she needs.


Avoid breaking with a text message or using online messaging. These forms of communication are much less personal than a phone call or a video chat, and your partner may not be able to get the closure that he or she needs. If you've been with someone for a long time, it may seem callous and anti-climactic to break up over text.
Avoid posting the breakup publicly on social media like Twitter or Facebook. This may come across as passive-aggressive, and your partner may retaliate publicly.

, Set a time and a medium for the conversation. This will prepare him or her for a serious conversation, and it will give you impetus to actually go through with the break-up.


For example, send a message: ""Are you around for a phone call this evening at eight? There's something that I need to talk to you about.""

If you have a regularly-scheduled ""Skype date"" or evening phone call, consider breaking the news during this time.
""We need to talk"" is near-universal code for ""There's something wrong with this relationship."" If you prime your partner with these words before the break-up conversation, he or she may go into the call with an inkling of what is to come. If you have been having trouble in your relationship for a while, he or she may even expect it.

, Get it over with. Say, ""I hate to do this over the phone, but I need to say what I feel. This relationship isn't working for me, and I want to break up.""


Lay out your reasons for ending the relationship. Be gentle and kind, but do not compromise. Speak honestly and speak from the heart.
For example: ""I can't handle the distance any more. It's eating me up and splitting me apart inside. You're a wonderful person, and I hope that you find someone who can give you what you need--but I can't be that person.""

For example: ""I don't see us winding up in the same city within the near future, and I don't want to keep pouring time and energy into something that isn't going anywhere.""


, This is especially important when you aren't breaking up in person. Do not make the break-up sound like a deal or a suggestion. Be sure of your resolve and be clear in your intentions.


Try to keep your explanation short and simple. The longer you linger, and the more you say, the more complicated the break-up may become. Words can tangle.
Try to avoid an argument. Don't accuse your partner of anything, and don't lay blame. Explain that the break-up is about you and your inability to stay emotionally invested in this relationship.

, Be patient and empathetic. Let your partner speak his or her side of the story, and listen.Stay on the line for as long as it takes to help your now-ex along the path to closure. Be aware that he or she may not find peace immediately, depending on how emotionally invested he or she is in the relationship.
When there is nothing more to say: hang up. It's over.

, Consider mailing a box of things, or giving the items to a mutual friend to deliver.


Tell your partner how you plan to return their things, and be sure to follow through. This is a kind gesture, and it may give your partner some peace of mind to know that they'll be getting their possessions back.
Get this over with as soon as possible. This will help you both move on from the break-up. If you procrastinate, you will only feel worse about returning the things later on.

, Avoid talking to your ex so often; resist the urge to contact or respond to him or her. Make it clear that the relationship is over, and make your intentions clear.


If you interact with your partner primarily through technology--phone calls, text-messages, and the Internet--you will need to form new habits around these technologies. The relationship exists within the devices.
If you ""break up"" with someone, but you still talk to him or her every day, you will remain emotionally invested. If you can maintain clear boundaries, feel free to do so--but be careful of letting a relationship linger on.
Make sure that your ex understands this. If you are the one who initiates the break-up, your partner may remain emotionally attached to you. He or she may try to contact you again, and you should handle these feelings respectfully.

, He or she may feel the need to speak with you again after the break-up, whether it is to explain thoughts or air grievances. Do what feels right--but consider taking the time to speak with your ex.


Be empathetic, but firm. Listen to your ex, and try to understand his or her point of view. Absorb what your ex has to say, but do not let it sway you. Remember why you initiated the break-up in the first place.
If your ex happens to visit your area, and wants to meet up to talk--consider meeting, but be careful. If you fall back into your old relationship patterns for in-person communication, you may give your ex the wrong idea.

, Lay down your screens and go outside. Re-connect with your work and your friends. Appreciate your freedom.


Try to meet new people. Join meetup groups, attend events, get involved in your community and build new connections.
Use the break-up as a catalyst for other positive changes in your life. Do the things that you've always wanted to do. If you use the break-up as a time for personal growth, you may find it easier to move on, and you may face a lower risk of relapsing.

, Let the relationship end, even if the break-up is jagged. You are doing this for a reason.If you ever get nostalgic for your ex, remind yourself why you broke up with him or her.
Consider keeping the list that you made of reasons to break up. If you begin to reconsider the relationship and grow wistful for the past, you can read over this list and renew your purpose.

Understand your differences.,
Try to relate.,
Enjoy the attention.,
Don't take your partner for granted.,
Keep it fun.,
Negotiate.,
Take small steps.,
Go the extra mile.",How to Date a Hopelessly Romantic Person When You Are Not Hopelessly Romantic," Psychologists have identified at least three different primary ""love styles"" based on friendship, passion, and game playing.Some suggest there may be as many six different ways of experiencing the condition of being in love, and that most people experience love as a blend of two or more of these.Spend some time thinking about what love means to you, and what it means to your partner.


Psychologist John Lee argues that there are six love styles: eros (romantic/passionate love), Ludos (love as a game), Storge (love as deep friendship), Pragma (love as a useful arrangement), Mania (love as obsession), and Agape (love as selflessness).Think about which style or styles best fit you, and which best fit your partner.
If your partner is a romantic but you are not, that doesn't mean you love your partner less, it just means you experience love differently.
Understanding and appreciating your differences is important in any romantic relationship.;
, Try to put yourself in your partner's place, and understand their way of seeing things.


If you and your partner have different approaches to communicating your feelings, consider whether your way of communicating is getting the message across.For you, mowing the lawn or doing some other chore for your partner might be a way of saying ""I love you,"" but consider your partner's perspective: is he or she receiving that message from your actions?
Your needs are valid, but so are your partner's, so it's important to consider whether or not you're communicating your feelings in a way she or he understands., Dating a romantic can be very fulfilling. Try to focus on the perks instead of the extra effort you may have to make.


Your partner will probably make an extra effort to remember what you like, to do fun, spontaneous things with you, and to cheer you up when you are feeling sad.Additionally, most of the time, the primary thing your partner will want in return is to be loved by you.They are also likely to focus on the the things they like about you.None of this means you don't have to do anything nice in return, but it does mean you are lucky enough to have a partner who really enjoys being with you and wants you to feel the same.

, In any relationship, it's important to take the time to value the nice things your partner does for you, and to make that gratitude known to him or her.This is especially important when dating a hopeless romantic. He or she will likely try to do lots of things to make you feel happy and loved. If you don't appreciate this, your partner will eventually move on.This can be as simple as telling your partner how much you appreciate the things they do for you, especially after they have done something particularly nice.

, Sharing new experiences is good for any relationship, because it keeps the relationship exciting and fun.Again, this is especially important when dating a hopeless romantic, who is likely to enjoy spontaneity. A romantic will try to create little surprises to let you know you are loved,and will probably enjoy it if you do the same.
For example, plan a trip to a place neither of you have been to before, or take a class together that focuses on an activity that's new to both of you.

, Every lasting relationship involves negotiation and honest sharing of your feelings. If you are having trouble finding a middle ground with your partner where you can both feel fulfilled, take some time to have an honest conversation about your expectations.Be open about your feelings, without ascribing blame. Phrases like ""I feel,"" I'd like it if,"" ""I really want,"" and so forth are great because they promote openness without the blame that comes with a phrase like ""you make me feel.""Ask for space if you need it. Some people need more time alone than others, and there's nothing wrong with that. Be gentle, but direct in explaining this. As you do this though, it's a good idea to let you partner know that this isn't about them, it's about your needs. Reaffirm your commitment to the relationship as you ask for space.Let your partner know that it's okay to express his or her emotions, too. Tell her or him that their feelings are important to you.When your partner talks, really listen, don't just wait your turn to talk.This means making eye-contact, trying to put aside distracting thoughts, and checking in from time to time to make sure you are getting the message your partner is trying to communicate.Look for a compromise.If your partner's idea of a great evening is a moonlight walk on the beach, and yours is going to museum together, look for a solution in which you both can get what you want, even if it means you don't always get what you want.
In these negotiations with your partner, be attentive and accommodating to the needs and feelings they communicate to you. If your partner is feeling insecure or under-appreciated, this will help them to feel loved and valued.If you've hurt your hopelessly romantic partner's feelings, say you're sorry.Even if you didn't mean to do anything wrong, or don't think you did, you can still apologize for hurting them.

, There are lots of small things you can do that will help your romantic partner feel loved on a day to day basis. These small steps don't take much effort, but can make a big difference. Below are a few suggestions.


Hold hands. When walking down the street, sitting on the couch, or riding on the bus, take your partners hand. It may not seem like much, but your partner will notice.Let your partner know you are thinking of them when you're apart. Send a flirty text or email, or tell him or her about something you've just seen or heard that you think would make them laugh.You can also surprise your partner with a little love note, posted somewhere she or he will be sure to find it.Buy a little gift. It doesn't have to be much: some flowers, a favorite candy, a book or some music you came across that you think your partner would enjoy.It's just another little way of saying: ""I've been thinking about you and I care.""

, Once in a while, make the extra effort to sweep your partner off their feel with a bigger romantic gesture.


Even if it's not the most important part of a relationship to you, its important to be romantic sometimes. Not only will your hopelessly romantic partner treasure these gestures, it will serve as a great reminder to both you that you value the relationship and find your partner exciting to be with.For example, make plans for dinner at a romantic restaurant, or plan a special vacation together. If you don't have time for long trip, just go away for a weekend or even an evening to a nearby wine district or a cute bed and breakfast.Make your partner something. Write a poem or a song or make a piece of art inspired by your hopeless romantic partner. If you aren't artistically inclined, use photographs of the two of you to make a card or a calendar, or even just get one framed.Cook a special dinner of your partners' favorite foods, and serve it by candlelight. It may not be original, but don't mistake a classic for a cliché.Give your partner a massage. You can buy a professional massage, or give them one yourself. There are many books that can show you some basic techniques. You can light some candles to make it extra romantic."

, Taking care of one another is what a relationship is all about. If you feel confident making a great meal, then cook one of your specialties for your beau.

Dancing is great exercise, and it’s an excellent way to bond with one another. Don’t worry about looking goofy--that’s part of the fun. If you live in an apartment above others, try to keep the stomping and loud music to a minimum.



Slow dancing is easy and romantic.
Swing dancing can be tricky to get the hang of, but it’s really fun., Plan to sit down in front of a film you’ll both enjoy. Cuddle up together under a cozy blanket and make hot chocolate or tea if it's cold outside. If it's warm, make iced tea or a special cocktail. Burn some incense or scented candles to improve the atmosphere.Your local library may have a big stock of videos that you can borrow for a small fee, or even for free.
Some services like Amazon will rent you a movie for just a few dollars.
You may be able to find strange and wonderful DVDs at a thrift store, too!

, Engaging in a creative pursuit together is wonderful. Concentrating on a work of art actually facilitates conversation, and will help you learn more about one another.

Jenga, Battleships, and Monopoly are solid choices, while Clue and Pictionary wouldn’t work as well.Learn a new card game together, if you’re both card sharks. There are tons of resources on the Internet to find weird and wonderful games you’ve never heard of., Select a budget and a time limit. Then, each of you will do the research to plan the perfect dream vacation in an exciting locale, from India to Iceland. After the time limit is up, review each other’s choices.

Look for events sponsored by local businesses, schools, churches, or the city.
Check your friend’s feeds for events that they’ve shared or are interested in attending.;
, While tickets can be costly, most museums, zoos, and fairs offer free admission on certain days or during certain times.Oftentimes this information is available on their websites, but you may need to call to ask for details. You and your date could save mega bucks by going when the facility is free.


Even if you don’t think that your area has a museum, Google it just in case. Some cities have small facilities that can still be interesting.

Allow yourself to be vulnerable.",How to Be Lovable," If you see yourself as ultimately unlovable that's going to influence people into thinking that you're unlovable. It's important, first and foremost, to see yourself as lovable, because you are lovable.


Expecting people to find you lovable if you don't find yourself lovable is putting way too much pressure on other people. It also takes the control out of your hands and puts it into the hands of other people, who may or may not be good enough for that.
Because you determine how you see yourself, if you act with confidence in your own lovableness, other people are more likely to see that and respond to that, even if they are only doing so subconsciously.;
, The more you tell yourself that you're wrong for having those feelings, the more you try to suppress your feelings, or change them, you're going to make yourself feel rejected and abandoned. That's not a kind way to treat yourself.Pay attention to how you feel. If you feel down about something, ask yourself why you feel that way? What caused it? Is it related to something bigger than just one specific incident?
Emotions alert you to the fact that something could be wrong. For example, if you're feeling upset about something, it acts in a similar way to physical pain. It's telling you that something is wrong (a situation is unhealthy for you, a person is not healthy for you, the way you've been treating yourself is unhealthy, and so on).

, Everyone has an inner critic that tells them all the awful and bad things they're doing. You can never fully get rid of that inner critic, but you can help shed light on those negative thoughts, giving them less power to control you.


Consider why you feel like you're not lovable. Is it because someone recently broke up with you? Is it because you tell yourself that you're ugly, or that your personality is too weird?
Pay attention to these thought processes. When you do find that you're having a negative thought about yourself, acknowledge that you're having a negative thought, and replace it with a positive or neutral thought.

, Putting the pressure on other people to validate you and make you feel good about yourself puts you in a completely powerless situation. Instead of looking for other people to validate you, practice validating yourself.Set up a gratitude journal that is focused on the things you appreciate about yourself. Record at least three things every day that you're grateful for about yourself.
Before you come to someone with a painful story that requires validation, give yourself the validation that you need. This doesn't mean that you stop reaching and connecting with others, it means that you are first off there for yourself.
Ask yourself what sort of validation you need right now. Ask yourself what will make you feel better, feel more balanced, healthier, and then give that validation to yourself.

, It's hard to deal with life when every single thing that happens makes you feel the weight of the world. If you have a tendency to talk too much with a person that you're romantically into, don't get down on yourself about it. Instead make a joke out of the situation.Things like being a little clumsy, doing something horrifically embarrassing can be a chance to laugh at yourself (kindly).

, At no point in life are you going to be perfect. That's okay! No one else is either. If you're thinking that you have to be perfect to be lovable, cease that thinking right now.You deserve love no matter how imperfect you are, no matter if your hair has a tendency to frizz at the slightest hint of moisture, or if you have a goofy laugh, or braces. None of those things makes you the slightest bit less lovable.
Also, when you create the expectations of perfection for yourself, you tend to begin applying those expectations to other people, to relationships. It's hard to love someone who is constantly making you feel like you aren't good enough (and that includes you making yourself feel like you aren't good enough).

, People tend to be drawn to those who are happier and are having more fun with their life. Instead of trying to make yourself or your life ""perfect,"" start to enjoy the things that are already in it.


Being lovable is about being open and when you're open to the vagaries of life you're going to be happier than if you shut yourself off or focus completely on trying to make things better.
Try to find ways to enjoy your job. If it isn't a job that you specifically enjoy, then do your best to build fun things into your workday so that you don't feel so down about it. Make yourself a delicious lunch that you can look forward to, go for a walk in the sun on your break.
Spend time with your friends. You don't have to do anything particularly exciting, but just hanging out and drinking tea together can rejuvenate you and make you feel happier about yourself and your life.

, No one is guaranteed a relationship and that's okay, because you don't need a relationship to be happy. Being lovable is all about being okay on your own, loving yourself so that you don't depend on other people to do so.


Have dates with yourself. Take yourself out for a picnic with a lovely book, or treat yourself to a fancy dinner.

, It can be really easy to wall yourself off from loving other people, especially if you've been hurt in romance or friendships in the past. Being open tends to cause people to be drawn to you.The more you love people, the more love you’ll attract to yourself. This doesn't mean that you need to love every single person you come across, but it means not shutting yourself down even after experiencing a difficult romantic or friendship betrayal.

, While you don't want to shut yourself off from love, you should be careful about who you love. Lovability doesn't just come about because you make yourself lovable. It comes about because you pick the people who can love you best.


Look for people who can be intimate with you, people who can open up and show the vulnerable parts of themselves. People who can share themselves in intimate (this does not necessarily mean sexual) ways are people who can care deeply about you.
Keep people who make you feel like the very best version of yourself. If someone consistently talks down to you, or talks over you, or encourages you in things that aren't healthy, you shouldn't keep that person around. Now if someone listens to you, supports you when you're feeling run down, and encourages the best sides of you, that's a keeper.

, It may seem counter-intuitive to create boundaries when you're talking about love, but it's incredibly important. You need to be clear about what you need from a relationship with someone, and you need to be clear about your own needs.


Put your own needs on the same level as other people's. Your needs aren't more important than theirs but you shouldn't feel like your needs are less important than the people around you.
If someone cannot give you the emotional support and love that you need, then you have every right not to make them a close, particular friend or lover. Not everyone is going to give you love and you're allowed to need that in a relationship.

, Everyone needs love, everyone. Some people might pretend that they don't, it's simply a pretense. Because of this you need to learn to express your need for love in a way that isn't needy, or whiny, or demanding, or controlling.


Do your best to make the life of the person you are loving life just a little bit easier. Offer them help or a little gift without expecting anything in return.
Tell people that you love them freely and without expecting anything in return (if they aren't giving you any reciprocity then they aren't worth your time).

, You shouldn't just practice kindness towards people you hope will love you. Make kindness your default way of dealing with everyone, including people who are difficult. Kindness isn't rolling over and taking everyone's ridiculousness, but it does mean that you see people as human beings and worthy of kindness and empathy.


Practice the “Loving Kindness” meditation. Sit with your eyes close and imagine what you'd wish for your life. Pick three or four phrases to demonstrate your desires (May I be healthy and strong. May I be lovable. May I be happy.). You will repeat these desires, directing them at different people. Start with yourself, move on to someone who has helped you, move on to someone that you feel neutral towards (neither like nor dislike), move on to someone you dislike or have issues with, finish by focusing on everyone., Being lovable means being kind and one aspect of kindness is helping other people. You can help someone by holding a door for them, offering to carry their groceries, driving your grandmother to a doctor's appointment.


It also includes speaking out against unkindness. When you see that someone is being bullied, or talked down to, or treated poorly, take action. Step in and explain to the bully why their behavior is inappropriate.

, Being appreciative of the world can open you up in more positive ways than if you shut yourself down. This is especially true when you’re feeling less than happy with yourself or with the world. People are more attracted to people who are positive in their habits.


Focus on the small things in life. Be grateful for the little things like getting a parking space, and having a few moments to yourself in the morning while you finish your tea. This will help you feel more positive about yourself and appreciative of the world around you.
Challenge yourself to come up with three things you’re grateful for every single day. If the sun was shining, write that down, if you had a delicious meal with a favorite friend, that's something to be grateful for!

, Making eye contact with people shows that you see them and acknowledge them as a person. Don't just do it with that really attractive person at the other end of the bar. Acknowledge the checkout person at the grocery store, the person standing in line behind you for the bus, and so on.


People respond to acknowledgement and it makes them feel good about themselves. The more loved and appreciated you make other people seem, the more love and appreciation you'll be offered.

, There's nothing like having a bad day and seeing the smile of someone you don't even know, or even the smile of good friend. Like eye contact this is acknowledgement and kindness.


It also makes you seem more approachable when you smile. People often pair approachability with lovableness.

, You don't have to be the center of every single party, but cultivating some good social skills will help you be successful when you're out in the world and meeting people. Eye contact and smiling, obviously go along with this.Talk to people at parties. Introduce yourself if you don't know someone and ask them about themselves. People love to talk about themselves and they'll think fondly of you if you seem interested in them.
Remember that, even if you feel awkward, not only do most other people feel the same way, but they're probably not going to notice your seeming awkwardness.

, True listening is a skill that's gone out of style. So often people don't feel like they're being heard by the people in their own life and it's something that most people desperately want.


When someone is talking to you, make eye contact. Ask questions to show that you're listening, or if you space out for a moment or get distracted, ask for clarification.

, The Golden Rule is a big one here, whether you're religious or not. Doing to others what you would want them to do to you is a great way to live your life.


Be the friend who is available to help out if needed. Offer your help to move them, drive them to a doctor's appointment or a job interview, and so on.
Invite your friend or significant other out for something fun. Make them dinner, take them to the movies, and so on.

, You don't need to make every feeling you ever have clear as a bell to each person you meet and definitely don't bottle it all up because that only makes things harder! Instead, you need to be open to letting the people you care about and trust into your heart and your emotions.


This is especially important to do if you've been hurt previously. The knee-jerk reaction is to pull away from any possibility of vulnerability due to previous hurt be it emotional or physical, but shutting yourself down and hiding away from this is not going to make you lovable, because you won't be able to let people love you or know you properly.
The desire to be loved initially may direct you to be subservient to others for them to like you. But being nice to be loved is different from being emotionally available to be easily hurt by others, don't let it all out at once try braking it down only when you feel you need to let something out. Let no one have the audacity to take advantage of your niceness for which you will need to strengthen your defenses, being nice is not weakness it means you care and you have a kind heart. Be witty, have a sense of humor while dealing with imbecile or ignorant ones and free yourself from being used, controlled or influenced for things unnecessary.

What are your hopes and expectations for the relationship? What are your fears?
How often do you expect to check in with each other? Do you expect to communicate with each other in some way every day?
How often will you visit each other in person? What’s realistic given your budget and responsibilities (i.e. school/work schedule)?
Will you see other people while you’re apart, or will you be monogamous? How will you satisfy your physical needs/desires from afar?;
, You can do this by talking about your relationship but also through daily actions. One great way to do this is to keep your partner updated on your everyday life, including the people you interact with.


Keeping your partner updated on your daily life will help them feel more involved in your world and your daily life. This will help them feel more secure in the important role they play in your life.Consider your partner’s feelings when making choices. For example, going out for late-night drinks with a cute member of the opposite sex or an ex when your partner is halfway across the world might make even a secure partner a bit nervous.

, Chances are that you ultimately hope to be in the same place as your partner. Being clear about your end goals will help keep you and your partner committed to the relationship.


Discussing the end game of your relationship will also help ensure that you and your partner are on the same page. Maybe you’re hoping to get married in a few years if all goes well.
If you’re both just enjoying an international fling, that’s okay too. It’s just important that you both know that, otherwise you might have one person pining over the other while the other is happily dating around, which isn’t fair.

, Even if these plans don't go ahead, talk about your future. Where would you like to visit with your partner and what would you like to do when you're there?


Talking about the future can break the distance and make you feel more positive that the relationship is heading somewhere.
Planning a trip together can be a lot of fun. Make a shared Google doc or a Pinterest page detailing the things you’d like to do on your trip. You might even put together an Itinerary together.

, People in long-distance relationships are no longer limited to snail mail and pricey telephone calls. Here are some apps that make keeping in touch easier and more affordable:WhatsApp, Viber, and Skype allow you to send messages and files, and call each other from anywhere in the world as long as you have an Internet connection.
Couple, Avocado, and Kahnoodle also allow you to chat and send pictures and videos, but their focus on romance sets them apart from other apps. You can “thumb kiss” your partner with Couple, send virtual hugs and kisses with Avocado, and “fill your partner’s love tank” with affectionate acts on Kahnoodle.
HeyDay allows you to keep a journal as you go about your day. You can take photos and add captions, and can even track where you’ve been through the day, then share your day with your partner to help them feel more like they were there with you.

, Things will be different for each relationship, but this advice seems to be unanimous: at the very least, say good morning and good night to your partner each day. It doesn’t have to be long chats — just a simple “Good morning beautiful!” or “Night night!” is perfect. It’s just important to schedule some time each day to be virtually close with each other, no matter how long that time is., Research has found that spending too much time together online or on the phone when you’re in a long-distance relationship can actually be damaging to the relationship. Keep this in mind while discussing your expectations., Talk to the people you’re close to, namely your friends and family. Let them know about your situation, and tell them how you feel about it.


Maintaining a good support network will help you stay strong when you’re feeling sad and lonely, and missing your partner. You can even talk out some of your insecurities with your closest friend or family member when you’re feeling low.
It’s okay to talk to your partner about your insecurities too, but try to avoid it unless they’ve done something to make you feel insecure. This will help keep things lighter and more positive when you talk to your partner, which is important since you have limited time with each other.

, As helpful as your friends and family might be, they might not be able to fully understand what you’re going through. There are a lot of great forums online, including a popular one on Reddit.Forum-goers talk about their problems, their fears, and their joys. They also share tips and tricks for keeping the relationship fresh and healthy.

, Long-distance relationships may not be ideal, but research suggests that they can actually be just as good as geographically close ones. Here are some keys attributes of high-quality, stable long-distance relationships:The people in them have a positive attitude towards long-distance relationships and do not feel that their relationship is automatically doomed just because of the distance.
People in them worry less and focus on the positive.
People in them feel more certain about their relationships.
Greater distances seem to result in higher long-distance satisfaction, too.
Each partner idealizes his/her partner to some extent.

, Whether your partner has to move away due to work or it's a new relationship that has formed via the Internet, you need to realize that you are separated by distance, for now. Take some time to reflect upon this.


The most difficult thing to deal with is the fact you can't see or touch your partner whenever you want to. It might hurt, but you need to come to terms with it, otherwise you’ll just be unhappy all the time, making for an unhappy relationship.

, If you love your partner just be thankful at the fact that you have them, even if they aren't physically with you right now.


Find things to be grateful for, rather than focusing on the negative (namely, the distance). For example, maybe you’re building stronger communications with your partner, and getting to know them on a deeper level.
By focusing on the positive things about your partner and your relationship, you’ll feel more in love with them and more positive about the relationship, meaning you’ll boost your chances of staying together despite the distance., Of course it’s sad that you can’t be together, but focusing on this might make it difficult to see the good in your relationship.


Being positive means keeping things light when you talk to your partner — talking about the little things that happened throughout your day, for example.It’s okay to talk to your partner about any real concerns you have. You should be positive, but you shouldn’t pretend things are okay when they aren’t. If your partner does something to hurt your feelings, it’s important that you let them know so that you both can work out a plan to avoid that happening in the future.
Be positive about yourself, too. Studies show that people feel happier and more satisfied in relationships where their partners keep their doubts about themselves and the relationship to themselves.Don’t be totally uncommunicative, but be mindful about what you talk about. Don’t call yourself fat or stupid, for instance.

, While it’s important to be positive, it’s also important to be realistic. Being realistic about what you can and can’t do in the relationship will keep things healthier in the long run.As an example, if you know you can’t afford to see each other more than twice a year, be honest and up front about this, otherwise it might become a problem later in the relationship.
Being realistic also means accepting that there will be times you’ll miss your partner, or times when you won’t be able to talk to them when you really need to. Being realistic will help you feel less helpless in such situations. This is where having a good support network will come in handy.

, If you’re not securely attached, you’ll feel so anxious and depressed when your partner is not around, that you may even find it difficult to go about your daily tasks., This is one of the most important things you need to have in order for your relationship to be successful, regardless of whether it’s long-distance or geographically close.If your distrust your partner and they have done nothing to deserve that distrust, chances are you have trust issues and need to work on them yourself. See a counsellor. Don’t make your trust issues your partner’s problem.

, When the feeling arises that maybe your partner doesn’t care as much as you do, write about it in a journal or discuss it openly with them in a non-accusatory way, rather than internalizing it and turning it into a power game.

, A lot of people might not understand why you would want to be in a long-distance relationship. Many of them might tell you the relationship won’t work. You’re best off ignoring them. Only you know your relationship, and if you’re happy, then that’s all that matters.


Don’t be put off by what other people say, do what you feel is right. If it makes you and your partner happy talking every night on Skype then do it. Don't let other people spoil it for you!

, You have to have your own life even if you miss your partner dearly. Having your own life will give you more to talk about with your partner, and will make you feel more fulfill and happy.


Keeping busy will also help you dwell less on what your partner is doing/how you aren’t together.

, There's no point being in an unhappy relationship. You can't change the distance, but it doesn't mean that you can't have fun together. Watch movies, play games, take up hobbies together — find things that allow you to bond despite the distance.

, A lot of people in long-distance relationships dedicate one night a week to have a special, extended hangout with their significant other. Maybe you’ll have a romantic video chat, or maybe you’ll make dinner together. Do whatever appeals to you!

, There are countless online games that you can play together. Scrabble and Minecraft are popular choices., Co-write a funny story in a shared Google doc. Draw something together on FlockDraw., There are countless apps that allow you to share a virtual room with your partner and watch videos or listen to music. Google+, Rabbit and Gaze are popular apps for watching videos together.


TogetherTube lets you enjoy music and videos that appear on YouTube, Vimeo, and SoundCloud together while chatting.Web plugins (for example, ShowGoers for Google Chrome) also exist that can help you sync up your Netflix accounts, making the struggle of starting a movie or show at the same time much easier., Send your partner a book you think they’d like, along with their favourite cookies. Or maybe send some silly underwear for them to wear the next time you meet up. Get creative!

, Pick up a few books on the subject, read some examples, and then make it a contest to see who can write the most ridiculous love letter. Some more ideas to spice up your love letters:


Spritz the letters with perfume or cologne.
Include dried flower petals in the envelope.
Kiss the pages with lipstick on/seal the envelope with a kiss.
Write on fancy stationery and use fancy sealing wax and a stamp to seal the envelope.

, Visiting each other as much as possible makes the whole situation better. Being able to spend some quality time in person with your partner is one of the best things in a long distance relationship.


Just think, you can look forward to seeing them and it makes the time when you're together more special. Make sure that when you see each other you go out and visit places, and do things together!

Select a date activity.,
Plan an adventure.,
Make it ultra romantic.,
Date safe.,
Stay in for a cozy night.,
Choose an eatery.,
Match the tone of the date to the tone of the restaurant.,
Cook dinner at home.,
Don’t forget dessert.,
End gracefully.,
Go with the flow.",How to Plan a Date," In general, the person who asks for a date also chooses the activities--however, it is perfectly appropriate (and advisable) to ask the other person's input. If you do not know your date very well, (especially on a first date) you might want to choose an activity with broad appeal that most people enjoy. That way chances are high that the two of you will have a great time.Try one of these typical date night venues:


Be tourists in your own city. Go for a walk in the city’s prettiest park, visit a museum you have been meaning to go to, or take a ferry ride so you can appreciate the beautiful skyline.
Get tickets to see a movie. In general, pick a broadly popular one. Generally, choose romantic comedies or action movies over serious dramas and gory war movies.
Find a place to see live music concert . This could be a restaurant, coffeehouse, or bar. But it could be a free outdoor concert.
Catch a sporting event, such as baseball, football, hockey, basketball, or whatever is playing tonight.
Go to a restaurant, ice cream parlor, coffeehouse, food truck, or bar (if appropriate).
Go to an amusement park or state fair. Usually there is a little something for everyone, including rides, games, food, shows, and so on.;
, If you think he or she will appreciate something a little more adventurous, you have many options for planning a fantastic date. Doing something that may be a little scary and crazy together is a great way to have fun, bond and get to know each other better. Just be sure it is relatively safe, and is not too ""out there"" for either of you to handle. Here are some ideas:


Go to an amusement park and ride roller coasters together. Holding hands afterward on the Ferris wheel is also a plus.
Go to a water park and take advantage of the water slides. Remember to tell your date to bring a bathing suit!
Try an adventure sport together. Skiing, snowboarding, surfing, kayaking, snorkeling, rock climbing, rappelling and caving are all great options.
Look into skydiving, bungee jumping for real adrenaline junkies!
Take or rent some bicycles and hit the bike path.
Try something really different that neither have you have tried before: learn to play a didgeridoo, take a tango class, a theater improvisation workshop, make Mongolian cuisine, take a lesson on curling. Not all adventures have to be highly physical dares; sometimes an artistic, intellectual, or musical adventure is just as thrilling or interesting!

, If your idea of the perfect date is one that’s sweet from start to finish, plan a day that gives you and your date plenty of alone time and chances to help those first feelings of love grow ever stronger. Choosing a beautiful setting is key, so find a spot in your area that’s unquestionably pretty and an activity that does not require the two of you to get covered in dirt or sweat. Try one of these:


Go for a walk on the shore of an ocean, lake, pond or river. Any kind of water will provide the perfect setting for romance to happen. If there’s a pretty stone bridge, stroll over it. If the area has boat rentals, rent a rowboat or paddle boat so you can spend some romantic time in the water without getting wet.
Walk around the historical section of town, preferably a street lined with quaint cafes, ice cream shops and cute boutiques where you can buy each other sweet gifts.
Book tickets to a play. It helps if the play has a romantic element and a happy ending, since a sad play could upset the night’s mood. If you don’t like plays, go to a planetarium or another place that will give the two of you time to spend in the dark next to each other.

, Especially for a first date, plan dates that do not put you or your date in a vulnerable position. In general, this means not being completely in private, and not dependent on the other person:

Meet in a public place: movie theater, restaurant, state fair, nightclub, hockey rink, concert, comedy club. Be sure it is well-lit and has others about. A moonlit beach might be romantic, but choose the brightly-lit boardwalk rather than a deserted portion.
Have transportation independent of the other person. Even if she offers to drive, be sure to have a friend that can pick you up, or the bus schedule, or get a cab.
Have your own money, even if you do not expect to have to pay. You may need cab fare, or to cover your bill, or some other emergency.
Be extremely careful with drinks, especially alcoholic ones. Unfortunately, some people have been known to use ""date rape drugs"" in beverages. Be sure drinks are not poured away from your view. Have the bartender serve your drinks. Stick to bottled beverages you know the taste of rather than cocktails.
If you live or visit a dormitory, leave the door open. Young adults especially, may not really have a living area more suitable for entertaining. Leaving the door open creates a situation in which the two of you are not totally isolated.

, Inviting someone to your house is a rather intimate affair, since the person will get to know a lot about you just by looking around your living room. But for people who prefer a quiet night to a night on the town, this can be perfect. If you are ready to take this step, plan your quiet night by doing the following:


Make sure the house is very clean. If your date walks into a messy house, he or she will probably see that as a red flag. A dirty, disorganized, smelly living space is a turn-off. Cleaning up shows both you care for the other person, and you take some pride in yourself.
Create a romantic ambiance. Make sure the lighting is soft and a little dim. Make sure the space feels welcoming. Maybe you can have some favorite music playing at a reasonable level.
Be careful of coming on strong! Having dim mood lighting, Barry White playing, and incense burning might be too strongly suggestive for your girlfriend's first visit. It can come off as sleazy.
Have an activity planned. Pick out a few movies or shows to watch, or a multi-player video game. If you are a good cook, that is a fun two person activity, too.
Have some conversation starters. If you have objects that relate to you and your interests out, it helps facilitate discussion. You probably already have many in your home! For instance: your paintings, your guitar, your photography portfolio, your dog, your trophy shelf, and so on.
Be careful about the bedroom. Being too forward about inviting your date to your bedroom can send a strong message. There is nothing wrong with taking your date to your room, but if he or she looks uncomfortable, be sure to make it clear you can move somewhere else.

, You can have an amazing date at almost any type of restaurant, not just fancy and expensive ones. It can be a cantina with great margaritas, a French restaurant with luxurious entrees, even the new ice cream place.


You may want to choose a place you have been to before, or that someone you know has recommended. Nothing sours a date like ending up in a restaurant with prices that are shockingly high or food and service that’s sub par.
Check on the menu pricing. You can often get a sample menu online, and many restaurant reviews will give an idea of what you can expect to pay. This helps avoid an uncomfortable situation: finding yourself short of money, or at an unexpectedly extremely cheap or expensive eatery.
Plan to pay for your date’s meal if you are the one who’s organizing the date.

, If you spent the day kayaking in the ocean, consider having a casual meal. You could get lunch or dinner from a food truck, or buy sandwiches from a deli near the beach. If you are both sandy, sweaty, and wearing your beach gear, it might not be appropriate or practical to go to the expensive seafood restaurant.


If you’re going to be quite active all day, you could consider packing a picnic. Bring a bottle of champagne or wine to share to make it extra special.
While casual dining is great for a date, avoid eating at a fast food place if at all possible. It’s not the price of the food that matters, but the originality. Take your date somewhere special. When your date recounts details to her best friend, you don’t want her description to include, “And then we went to McDonalds.”

, Nothing could be more romantic than planning and cooking an entire meal for your date. If you’re planning to have a date night in, it’s a way to make your date feel very special. Plus, having good cooking skills is impressive and sexy. Just be sure to cook something you have made before, so you know it’ll turn out and taste delicious.


You don’t have to make a complicated six-course meal, but you also probably should not invite someone over for frozen pizza. If you are going to cook at home, make something quality. Or at least from a high-quality market. Sometimes making dinner together can be fun and romantic.
Pasta dishes are easy to make, and relatively inexpensive.

, You could get dessert at the same restaurant where you eat, or go to a different place to wind down the night. No matter what type of date you had, it’s nice to incorporate something sweet at the end. It is one last thoughtful touch that shows your date you put a lot of thought into planning the evening. Plus, it gives you the opportunity to share a dessert, just like in the movies.


Going out for ice cream is a nice way to end a date during the summer.
If you’re cooking at home, consider serving something with chocolate. It tends to be a favorite.
If your date does not have a sweet tooth, you could go to a bar to grab a nightcap instead. Of course, if you or your date do not drink or are underage, this is not a good idea.
Sometimes an individual cannot have rich desserts, especially those with diabetes. Or the person may have allergies, food sensitivities, medical conditions, or whatnot. Just be flexible and understanding.

, The end of a date can be a little awkward if you have not thought about it beforehand. Put some forethought into your plans. Are you going home separately after dinner? Do you plan to drop your date off after you’re finished with dessert? Perhaps you may like to invite the person back to your house. Think about the logistics so you avoid that awkward “what now” moment after an otherwise perfect date.


Have your house ready in case you end up there. Have it clean and presentable. A kitchen with last night’s dishes stacked in the sink and your dirty laundry in a pile on the floor will likely make a negative impression.
End the date at a good time. Ending a date on the right note is tricky. In general, end it at a logical moment. For example, after the late movie ends, offer to drive her back to her place. It is generally better to end the date a little on the too early side than too late.
Kiss, hug, or more? At the end of a date, especially a first one, generally a gesture will effectively end the date. This is sometimes a very awkward moment. Generally in a heterosexual date, the girl should decide what she is comfortable with offering the guy as a gesture.

, If something goes awry, remain calm and work towards having a good date anyway. A person who is inflexible, stresses out, and becomes irritable in the face of the unexpected will not be very successful with dates. In fact, dealing with the unexpected in a creative, positive way can make a big impression.

Cook dinner together.,
Make it a movie night.,
Plan a game night.,
Take part in a shared interest.",How to Date On a Budget2," Cooking dinner can be an intimate experience that provides a lot of opportunities for laughing and future stories. You can choose your favorite recipe or something really simple, depending on how good of a cook you are.If you can, gather up a few mood-setting materials such as candles, fancy plates, and a romantic playlist to make your dinner date really special.


If you’re new to cooking, try making spaghetti. All you need to do to make a simple spaghetti is to boil noodles, heat up a jar of sauce, and sprinkle on some cheese. Add a bagged salad and it’s like you’re in a restaurant.
If you already have some cooking skills, find out what your date’s favorite meal is and try to make that with them.

, Grab a film and few great snacks, then settle in. Movie nights are a great chance for you to share some of your interests with each other in the form of your favorite movies. You can watch movies from your own collections, stream them through an online service, check one out from the library, or rent from Redbox.

, Game nights can be a fun way to spend date night, and they’re also excellent for double dates. Bring your favorite board games, a few tasty snacks, and the drink of your choice. It’s a great opportunity to carry on a conversation and share memories from your childhood.Make sure that you choose two-player games if it’s just the two of you.
Avoid games that might cause arguments, such as Monopoly.

, Whether it’s gaming, books, art, sports, or a common hobby, plan your date around an activity that you both love.For example, you might face off on a favorite video game or make a collaborative art project. You could also go on an adventure to check out what’s new or what interests both of you.

Check Groupon, Living Social, and related discount sites.,
Look for dance nights at local eateries.,
Check your local sports teams for ticket deals or cheap seats.,
Look for a discount theater.,
Check for special deals.",How to Date On a Budget3," Discount services like Groupon and Living Social can be a great resource for dating on a budget. You can get cheaper tickets, two for one deals, discounted gift cards, and other budget-savers via these sites.


Talk to your date ahead of time about what activities you two are interested in enjoying. The discounts are only good if you actually use the tickets.
When using discount sites, think about related expenses. For example, if you want to buy cheap amusement park tickets, remember that you will also need to eat and drink inside the park. Check to make sure that you can bring items in, or plan for that added expense.

, Some restaurants and bars sponsor dance nights, where patrons can pay a small cover to participate in a short dance class followed by open dancing. They often focus on a particular style, such as salsa, swing, or line dancing. These events can be a romantic date that doesn’t cost much as long as you don’t give in to the urge to buy drinks. You may also find dance events sponsored by local churches or civic organizations., Visit the teams’ websites to look for discount days or undesirable seats that come at a lower cost. You can still enjoy a day at the game in the cheap seats.


Some fields allow people to filter down to unsold seats, so check to see if yours does.
If there is a minor league team, high school team, or even a peewee championship for a sport you both enjoy, consider going out to those games.

, Some theaters show older films that are no longer in major theaters. These can be old films or relatively recent films that are already out on DVD. If you are lucky enough to live in an area with such a theater, then take advantage of the discounted tickets. You can enjoy the theater experience with a movie rental price.

, You may be able to find special deals or coupons online, in flyers, in the local paper, or in your local phonebook. Places that offer bowling, mini golf, arcades, or pizza often offer special rates or two-for-one deals on certain nights, depending on how busy they are. You may be able to enjoy your favorite activities for a much lower price if you know when to go or have the right coupon.

Go for a walk.,
Go on a picnic.,
Spend the night stargazing.,
Spend a day in the water.",How to Date On a Budget4," Walking is both free and flexible. You can go for a walk in the park or try touring part of your city. If you live in an area with a downtown, historic site, boardwalk, or similar attraction, tour the area with your date. It’s a great way to get to know each other because you’ll be able to talk to each other.If you both really enjoy nature, try hiking.
See if your city or town has brochures or a local website that highlights its best features. Even the smallest of towns have something that makes them special.If you’ve been dating for a while, spice up your walk by using your phones to take vacation-style photos of each other at various sites around town.
If you live in an area with frozen-over lakes, try ice skating instead.

, Picnics are the classic budget date. You don’t have splurge on a fancy blanket and basket. Instead, use what you have to create a great meal outside. You can use a regular blanket, or look for a picnic table at your local park. Pack a lunch or choose something cheap from the premade section of the grocery store. Sometimes even fast food outside can be a fun date., Snuggling up together and looking at the stars can be a romantic way to spend the evening. Download a stargazing app, such as SkyView, and try to find the stars in your part of the sky. If you have a telescope, bring it with you. If not, enjoy the opportunity to make up stories about what you might be seeing.Bring hot cocoa for warmth and extra fun.

, If either of you has access to a pool, lake, beach, or pond, plan a date on the water. While swimming is a terrific way to enjoy time together, you can also enjoy food, drinks, paddling, fishing, and other related water activities. Even if you’re only able to feed a few ducks, it’ll still be a fun experience.


Check for ponds at local parks.
Consider the distance to local beaches or lakes.
Ask your date if their apartment complex or subdivision has a pool.

Clarify your expectations.",How to Determine Whether Your Long Distance Relationship Is Working," If a long distance relationship is working, you should feel as much or more trust and satisfaction as people in geographically convenient partnerships. Think of your partner. If you get a warm, thrilling feeling, that's a good sign.Some other questions you can ask yourself to check on your feelings include:


Am I happy?
Do I feel fulfilled and supported by this relationship?
Do I feel listened to, cared about, trusting, and open?;
, Is it a pleasure to talk to your partner? Do you love sharing details of your day? Do you love hearing details of your partner's day? All of these are good signs that you are actively building a loving relationship.Is your conversation affectionate? Do you tell your partner what you appreciate about them, and do they do the same for you? Every time you share appreciation you are building your attachment.

, How are your conversations about physical intimacy? Couples in long distance relationships often have better communication about sex than couples who live nearby.If you have frank, happy conversations about the things that you like and don't like, you're building a healthy sex life.


Can you have conversations about things you remember doing together? Things you haven’t tried yet, but would like too? If you both feel free and comfortable sharing fantasies and desires, that's a great sign.
Conversely, if you feel like you can't talk about sexual things, or if one of you is always demanding photos and messages that the other isn't comfortable with, your relationship might not be working out.[[

, Long distance relationships only work with great degrees of trust. In fact, the best long distance relationships have a stronger element of trust than other relationships.Being long distance means you can't check out one another's stories. You have to take your partner at their word.


Ask yourself: Do you trust your partner? Do you feel like your partner trusts you?

, If your partner doesn't take you at your word, that's a bad sign. If they frequently get mad at you for not answering your phone or texting them back quickly enough, they may be trying to control you. Watch out for phrases like ""I'm checking in on you"" or ""I don't want you hanging out with someone I don't trust.""Similarly, if you are feeling distrustful or controlling, you may want to back off.

, In an unhealthy relationship, one partner often tries to control the other by insisting on a greater time-commitment than is actually enjoyable or practical.Ask yourself: Does your partner insist on more of your time than you want?
Do you feel like you ""have to"" visit every weekend?
Does talking and texting with your partner interfere with your social life? If you try to negotiate this, what happens?
If you mention to your partner that you are feeling pressured to always be on call, your partner should respond by asking you what schedule you would prefer.
If your partner responds by getting angry or cold, you should take that as a sign that your relationship is not working out.

, Does it feel wonderful to see them? It may be awkward at first, but after a day or so, do you settle in? Can you still talk about all the things you talk about when you're at a distance?Meet their friends and family. Your partner should want to introduce you to some of their friends. Make sure that their friends know who you are and are friendly towards you.
If anyone acts nervous around you, or if nobody seems to have heard of you, something might be going on.
When your partner visits, are you proud of them? Do you want to introduce them to the people in your life? You should be pleased to bring your sweetheart into your community—if you aren't, that might mean you aren't that into them.

, Do you feel trapped, or stuck? Do you feel guilty for not thinking about your partner all the time? This may mean your relationship is not working.If you're not sure whether or not your relationship is healthy, talk about it with a psychologist, or try calling a hotline like Love Is Respect (1-866-331-9474).You can also talk with your partner about any feelings of satisfaction you are having. Try saying something like, “I am feeling dissatisfied with our relationship because…”

, Do you know how long you are willing to be long distance? Does your partner know? It is important to agree on a length of time. If the distance depends on a circumstance with no certain end date, your reunion may keep getting pushed off.Make sure that you discuss the financial aspects of maintaining your relationship with your partner as well. Being in a long distance relationship can be expensive, especially if you travel often to see your partner.


If your partner is waiting for a controlling parent to ""back off,"" that means neither of you have any control over the date.
Similarly, if you are waiting for a job to open up in your partner's city, you may be stuck waiting with no date in sight.
To avoid this, agree on a date by which you will either move (with or without the job) or break up.
For instance, you might say ""I'll move to your city as soon as I find a job there. However, if I haven't found one in the next six months, I'll just move and take my chances."" However, make sure that you have a conversation about finances before doing something like this to make sure that one partner is able to support the other as they look for a job.
If you are planning to be in a perpetually distant relationship, make sure you are both okay with that.

, You should both feel comfortable with the amount of texting, calling, emailing, and visiting you do. Ask your partner if they feel you're at the right level, and ask yourself how you feel as well.


If you find that one of you is feeling neglected or inundated, agree on a different schedule together.
If it feels like only one of you is willing to compromise, your relationship might not be working.

, You should still be able to hang out with friends, visit family, go to parties, and have time to yourself. If you feel like your long distance relationship is making it impossible for you to have a social life where you are, you need to draw some boundaries.Tell your partner you can't visit them as frequently. Explain that you are feeling lonely from never making any friends where you are.
Explain to your partner that you will schedule a certain amount of time to talk to them, but that you can't be on call constantly.
If your partner freaks out or refuses, your relationship might not be working.

, Do you know the terms of your relationship? Does your partner? Ask yourself what you expect, then make this clear to your partner and ask what they expect as well.


For instance, if you believe that you and your partner are monogamous, in love, and heading toward living together in the next few years, tell your partner!
Similarly, if you believe you and your partner are in an open relationship, you'll need to define those terms as well.
Being distant means communicating more, not less, so make an effort to get on the same page.
If your partner wants to ""keep it loose,"" that means they aren't willing to be open with you about their expectations. That's a bad sign.

Have reasonable expectations.",How to Make a Long Distance Relationship Work," Since you won't be seeing each other in person, it's important to establish and maintain an emotional connection as often as you can. These don't always have to be long, in-depth conversations.Frequent communication, no matter how minor, will show that you care enough to put in the time and effort into the relationshipand it’s easier to keep up to date with each other’s lives.If you allow large (days at a time) gaps to pass by, your everyday experiences fade into the background, and you will have to start from scratch every time you speak.


Learn your partner's preferred method for communication. Be sure to try a variety of technologies to see what works best for you both.You may try texting, emailing, or video-calling to keep up to date with little daily details of your lives.
Work around your schedules. If you know you're going to be too busy to communicate, let your partner know in advance and try to stay in contact as best you can. If you're not as busy as your partner, remain flexible and focus on something of interest to you.;
, Don't feel as though every conversation needs to be a thoughtful discussion about your relationship, hopes, or dreams. Instead, focus on the little things that couples who live together would, such as grocery shopping, doing chores around the house, or redecorating.This gives the feeling of creating a home together, something you both can look forward to.


Talking about the boring or mundane parts of your day can also foster connection and interdependence, the foundation of relationships., Try to make the time to visit each other as often as possible or as often as your budget permits. You need to see each other in person at every opportunity.Make a regular visiting schedule or at least make plans for the next visit as soon as each one ends. Face-to-face communication is just as important as having relationship satisfaction, commitment, and trust.Create your own rituals around your visits, like eating at a favorite restaurant, enjoying a quiet night together at home, or sharing a favorite activity.
Smooth out travel logistics so they don't get in the way of your time together. Know where to meet at the airport or train station. Learn to travel with one bag or leave basics at your partner's home to save time at the airport.
Meet away from home sometimes, too. Visit a place together that is new to both of you or choose a place that is halfway between both of you.

, Just like any relationship, you should spend some time really getting to know and understand your partner. When talking, take note of things your partner enjoys the most (like hobbies or day-to-day activities) and do a little research on it so you have something more to discuss.


Knowing each other's preferences will also help when you want to exchange gifts. Gift exchange is just another way to communicate your feelings for each other over the long distance., Distance makes the heart grow fonder, but can also make you idealize your partner. While this can make your relationship stable, extreme idealization (thinking your partner is perfect) will make it more difficult to reunite with the actual person.Maintaining day-to-day communication about your everyday lives will help humanize your partner and become aware of changes your partner might be going through., Be there for your partner if your partner is ever in trouble, hurt, or for whatever reason. You need to make yourself available to help so your partner knows you care. If your partner ends up dealing with important issues alone, your partner will eventually not need you.Interdependence refers to the willingness to act against your own self-interest for the benefit of you partner or for your relationship.Instead, supporting each other creates an interdependence that is crucial for a long distance relationship.


Interdependence can be seen in everyday activities like compromising about decisions and long-term behaviors like quitting smoking.

, Trust in a relationship is vital, regardless of distance.Try your best to be faithful and avoid temptation. If you do make a mistake, it’s especially important to be honest and tell your partner the truth in cases where lying would benefit you.For example, if you put yourself in a position of temptation (like going to a bar), lying about your whereabouts would benefit you personally, but would benefit your relationship if you were honest.


Frequent use of email and online resources can help cultivate trust in romantic relationships., Be open and honest by volunteering private information.You should both be morally committed to each other, continuing the relationship because of personal values, not because of social pressures.Personal values include beliefs like “staying faithful is part of my identity.” Social pressures involve the perception of society's approval or disapproval. For example, “My mom would be devastated if I cheated on my girlfriend and she broke up with me.”


Watch out for behaviors where your partner tries to manipulate you into doing something that only benefits your partner, like lying about an emergency to get you to answer your phone during an important business meeting. If dishonesty and manipulation become a part of your communication, then you must revisit why your relationship lacks trust.

, Communication is key, if you have a problem then talk it out, it will build better trust and a stronger bond. You can't maintain a relationship if you are terrified that they will do something to you because you did something out of anger.

, Create something that you both can access and share, such as an online blog or scrapbook. This will give you a new way to communicate while also giving you the sense of creating something together.You might create a food blog with your culinary adventures, Instagram your workouts, or create a special Twitter hashtag just for you two.


Share your online calendars too. If you miss each other, you'll have someplace to look to see why. You'll also have something to talk about, as in ""How was the concert last night?""

, This will make the distance between you seem smaller and more bridgeable.You'll feel closer together and you'll be bonding at the same time. If you're unsure of things to do, try one of the following:


Plan to cook the same meal on the same day. If neither of you are into cooking, you might just plan to eat the same cuisine or snack.
Read the same book or article. You can even take turns reading it aloud to each other.
Watch a TV show or movie simultaneously. Keep a call open and share your reactions.
Use video phones to chat while having meals or watching movies together.
Sleep together. You can both get on the phone or video chat and fall asleep together. Doing this occasionally can make you feel closer. If time zones are too different, try instead to be online to say good morning or good night to your partner.

, Choose a project you'd both like to do, like take an online language class or learn how to knit. Do whatever you're both interested in. This will give you a wonderful sense of shared history and you'll have something that really ties you together. It's also a great way to spend time together while giving you something to talk about.


Take advantage of the internet. You could play an online multiplayer game or something traditional, like chess. Either way, you can chat while playing, giving you a greater feeling of togetherness.

, Try to do little things that let the other person know that you care. You may write love letters and send them in the mail. Or, send small gifts, cards, or flowers for no reason.It's easier than ever to find ways to send almost anything to your partner.


Don't feel as though you can send something that makes a grand gesture. The little, frequent things are just as important as making the person feel special on special occasions.

, Try new things together, even if it means doing them apart. This way, you're not just talking on the phone, which can be a pitfall of long-distance relationships if it's the only thing you ever do. Instead, do something romantic like stargazing while you're on the phone. Synchronize and set your watches to go off at the same time every day, and make it a point to think of each other when your watch goes off.


Remind yourself that your partner is thinking of you while you do these activities together, even though you're far apart. It can strengthen your bond.

, It's important to feel like you have a place in your partner's life. Try meeting one another's friends, online or off.This will help you understand more of your partner's life and make communication easier.


If one of you must someday move so that you can be together, that person will be leaving friends behind. Start right away to begin a new social and professional network for the partner who is moving.

, Ask the important questions right away to make sure you are both clear on the nature of the relationship. Decide what kind of relationship you both want. For example, are you dating, seeing each other, boyfriend-girlfriend, or engaged? You should also define the exclusivity of the relationship (whether you'll see other people). For example, you might ask, ""Are you open to relocating if the relationship becomes more serious?"" or ""What are you looking to get out of this relationship?""


While these can be hard questions to ask and might lead to difficult conversations, defining the relationship will save you great heartache and misunderstanding later. This is important to build the relationship you both want.

, Explore the scary and difficult subjects along with the good. Consider this as a chance to explore your feelings together honestly. Recognizing your partner’s ups and downs while you are physically apart will make you more accepting and comfortable with their low points when you see each other in person.


It's understandable that you might only want to focus on the positive. But, you should let your partner know your low points.Both of you are human, and it’s ok to not always be happy.

, Focus on the positives of the distance, such as the ability to pursue your interests, hobbies, and career objectives. Realize that the distance will also push both of you to be more creative when it comes to communicating and expressing your feelings. Look at this as a chance to test your communication skills and emotions.


As long as you see the long-distance relationship as a temporary state, you will keep your chin up and send that feeling of security and happiness to your partner too.

, Remember, every kind of relationship takes hard work and dedication to your loved one or partner, whether it's long distance or nearby. If you and your partner are willing to take these steps, then expect bumps and turns in the road. If you can learn to navigate them, these challenges will only contribute towards a better relationship in the long term.


For example, you may be prepared to have difficulties around important dates or holidays that you must be apart for. If you know you can't be together for your anniversary, try to plan some special way to connect anyway.

Have regular sex.,
Enjoy your love life.,
Plan travel in advance.,
Prioritize your relationship.,
Take special trips.,
Consider artificial insemination.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Conceive when in a Long Distance Relationship1," When you are trying to conceive in a long distance relationship, you will need to make sex a focus of your relationship. Regular sex is important for conception. Depending on how frequently you and your partner are together, you may need to have sex during each visit.

When you are trying to conceive, it is ideal to have sex every two or three days. This will likely not be possible when you are in a long distance relationship.
Monitor your fertility. Try to have sex on the days that your fertility is at its peak.
Try to adjust your schedules so that you and your partner see each other as much as possible. When you are together, make sex a priority.
For example, if you are together on the weekends, try to have sex once a day. This will increase your odds of conception.
Unless there are complications, most women under the age of 35 will become pregnant within the first year of regular unprotected sex.;
, Obviously, men need to achieve orgasm for their role in conception. Women do not need to orgasm during sex in order to become pregnant. But having a good sex life is important when you are trying to have a baby.If you enjoy sex, you are more likely to want to have sex with your partner. Be open about your sexual needs. For example, try saying, ""I really love it when you do ABC.""
Have a sex life outside of conception. When you are trying to conceive, it can be hard to shift your focus. But remember to have sex because you enjoy being intimate with each other, not just to procreate.
Try to plan romantic date nights, not just sex. Spending time laughing and enjoying one another will help you enjoy one another more in the bedroom.

, Once you have learned how to chart your fertile window, it becomes easier to plan for sex in a long distance relationship. Try to arrange your time together around times when your body is most receptive to becoming pregnant. Take into account your cycle, your temperature, and your mucus.Choose a time each month to sit down with your partner and make a travel schedule. Figure out who is going to travel and when.
When you make your travel plans, consider your work schedules and any social or family engagements. Unexpected things might come up, but you'll be able to get a pretty good idea of what the month will look like.
Book plane tickets (or train tickets or rental car reservations) in advance. This will help ensure that you both follow through on your travel plans.

, Try to schedule at least two times each month when you will be together. If something comes up when you are supposed to be traveling to visit your partner, turn down the invitation. Commit to spending quality time with your partner.Keep the lines of communication open. Talk to each other daily and keep in touch via e-mail, Skype, etc.
If possible, sort out things like finances, household issues, etc. over the phone or via e-mail. That way, your face to face time can be about enjoying quality time together.

, When you are in a long distance relationship, travel can sometimes start to seem like a grind. It can become tiring, and even seem like a burden to feel like you are constantly going back and forth. This is a normal problem to have.Try taking a vacation together. Instead of traveling to see one another, go somewhere entirely different from your homes.
Taking a trip together will be a welcome respite from the grind of traveling to the same place all of the time. You will likely relax and enjoy each other.
Vacations are a great way to spice up your sex life. Take some time to enjoy the plush hotel room together.

, If you are unable to have regular sex, you can still get pregnant. There are safe and reliable ways to inseminate yourself at home. This method involves some research and preparation, but can help you avoid large medical bills.Collect and ship the sperm. The sperm will need to be placed in an airtight container, and shipped specially. Look for a company that offers cold shipping.
You can inseminate yourself at home. A popular product is called the Instead Cup, and can be used to insert the sperm into the woman's body.
Track your ovulation using a home monitoring kit available at the pharmacy. When you are ovulating, place the semen in the Instead Cup and insert it into your vagina. You can read more about this process in this helpful wikiHow article.
Continue to track your cycle carefully. Artificial insemination works best when you are at your most fertile.

, If you have any concerns about your prospects of conceiving, schedule an appointment with your doctor. Have an open conversation with her. Explain that you are trying to conceive while in a long distance relationship and you would appreciate any medical advice.If you are over the age of 35, it is a good idea to speak to your doctor when you begin trying to conceive. Women past that age sometimes face additional challenges.
If you have been trying for over a year to conceive with no luck, it is a good idea for both you and your partner to visit the doctor. She can run some tests to help you figure out if there is a medical reason that you have not yet conceived.

Be sure to communicate well with each other.,
Make plans to see each other and keep in touch with them.,
Don't blame yourself for feeling negative sometimes.,
Get active and creative.,
Don't worry about what others are saying.,
Believe in the relationship.",How to Control Your Emotions in a Long Distance Relationship," Article after article will explain how communication is essential to any relationship, even more so to a long-distance one, and that advice is possibly the best to give. Being without a loved one can be emotionally draining and tiring, so telling your partner how much you love them, miss them and want to see them regularly is essential to your relationship.


They no doubt feel exactly the same way, so never feel like you are the alone one and that this relationship isn't as hard for them as it is for you. It will help to ease your emotions and to put nagging and doubtful thoughts to rest. You are loved and so are they, even when you don't talk 24/7.;
, Planning your next visit will give you both something to focus on and talk about positively, getting rid of the negative feelings for both of you when you start dreaming of that day when you'll see them again. It will lift both of your spirits and generally put you in a better mood than if you hadn't planned another visit to see them. Even looking up train times or chatting about when they are next free will banish negative thoughts of ""I'm never seeing them again"", and cause you both to focus on the fun you will have when together again.

, Sitting around feeling like the world has ended without your partner is a common and normal feeling, so never feel like you're feeling awful for no reason or that you should start blaming yourself; your partner is most likely feeling exactly the same way, especially if they are sitting around at home too, miles away.


Talk to family and friends, write your feelings down in a poem or a letter or an email, and address them to your partner if you wish. That way, if you send them to your partner, he/she will really know how you are feeling and respect how honest you are being. Again, their feelings most likely match yours!

, There is nothing worse than sitting around feeling alone and sad without your partner, especially when your partner is the busy one. Say he/she has a new job and they are extremely busy day to day. You have arranged time to speak to each other but that's hours away, and you genuinely don't know what to do with yourself for the most part of the week, the day, even the morning.


Instead of wallowing in sorrow (which is so easy to do), take the time to get into a new hobby, a new career move, even a walk now and then, seeing friends or offering a neighbour babysitting services, the list is endless. Getting out and about, interacting with others will stop the self-pity and help you to feel happier day to day until the arranged time talking to your partner comes about, and it will come sooner than you think if you fill your days with things to do as opposed to doing absolutely nothing.

, Advice from other people, family and friends, on the whole, can be extremely helpful and honest, so by all means, when there are 'down days' in your week, go to them and ask for a friendly chat and a hug.


But never let what they say (if they seem concerned, like it won't work, it isn't working, or that you're having problems), affect how you feel about the relationship. It is your relationship, not theirs. They are probably only worrying so much because they care, they wouldn't want you to be unhappy whatever your situation.
Tell them you are on great terms with your partner but that the distance just makes it hard. Being honest with them and telling them how you feel is far better than holding it against them and not letting go of a grudge, which will ultimately grow and effect you both even more.

, It is your relationship and you've both invested your time, effort and feelings, so whenever you feel a bad mood coming on, remind yourself how much you love them and how thankful you are for you partner. Never forget that you are both strong enough to be in this relationship, and everything will eventually work out for the best. If you are having the worst down day ever, it is never too late to pick yourself back up again out of your stupor.


Believe in the hope and love you both have, and the trust you share. Also, believe in the promises you have made to each other if the relationship is that serious. Think about how far you have come in the relationship and stamp out those bad feelings; tell yourself they aren't welcome and that while you have every right to miss your partner, don't miss out on them personally because all you talk about is how upset you are all the time.

Be direct.,
Give them a call.,
Write them a letter.,
Keep your composure.",How to Break up With a Long Distance Boyfriend/Girlfriend1," If you’ve decided you want to break up with someone, the best route to take is sending a clear, concise message that the romantic aspects of your relationship is over. Keep it quick. You may not have specific reasons, and trying to explain yourself may actually make the break harder for both you and your partner.Go with something like, “This is hard for me to admit and I'm sorry I'm having to do this over the phone, but I can't be in this relationship anymore..."" You may want to pause after letting them know, and see how they respond. Your partner may understand, and saying more may complicate the conversation.
Keep in mind that the person may react with strong emotions, questions, and explanation. Be prepared for these responses.;
, Most of the time, you don’t want to visit a partner in another city simply to break up with them. Similarly, you don’t want to have someone visit you, only to break up with them. A phone call is likely the ideal method to have a break up conversation, as it more personal than a text or email, but allows you each to have your own space immediately following the call.


If the two of you have been open about how you’re feeling and a visit would be enjoyable for both of you, even if it marked the end of an era, this may be preferable. The important thing to remember is that you want to break up with someone in a way that doesn’t put them in an uncomfortable situation.

, Some people are better at conveying themselves by writing. Further, a letter allows you to get everything out in one go. This ensures that your partner hears your whole perspective before trying to argue or respond. If you’ve tried to have the conversation before, or are worried your partner may be argumentative or have trouble listening, a letter may be a good way to get your message across directly.


Be clear about your intentions for writing the letter from the onset. Start with something like, ""I'm writing to let you know that I've decided to end our relationship together."" Though this may feel too direct, it's important to be clear about your decision.
You might also add into the letter that if the other person wants to talk about it with you over the phone, then they can call you. This is a kind gesture that might help to make the person feel a bit better.

, Your partner may be surprised, hurt, or even angry about your decision to end the relationship. If you become upset, try to do some deep breathing or to ask for a break before continuing the conversation.


For example, you might say something like, “This is a bit overwhelming. Can I please call you back in about 15 minutes?”
To help make the other person feel heard, you might also say something like, ""I know you're hurt and shocked and I'm sorry to have caused you pain. However, I'm sticking with my decision because it is what is best for me right now.""

Don’t inconvenience her or make her choose between you and her friends or family. Call after drama club, soccer practice, her shift at the coffee shop, or family dinner.


Text her a few hours before you want to talk: Hey, will you be free to chat tonight? or Can I call you at 7? Be flexible and work out a mutually convenient time.

If she's busy:Don't: get irritated or sullen.Do: say How about tomorrow night? or Good luck on your midterm! Talk this weekend?

;
, Girls will be more open and honest with you if they know no one can overhear your conversation. Don’t call when you are hanging out with other people, and don’t put her on speaker phone without her permission., She is giving you the gift of her time, and you should do the same. Most young people believe that multitasking takes away from conversation.Let her know that her conversation is the most important thing in the world. Don’t text, chat online, watch TV, or talk to other people while you are talking with your girlfriend.

, Emotions are contagious.If you sound friendly and eager to talk, she will likely respond in the same way. When she answers the phone, greet her in a way that opens up the conversation and tells her you want to listen. Use words that are appropriate for how close you are:


Hey! How's my girl doing?
Hi beautiful! How was your day?
I’ve been looking forward to hearing your voice all day! What have you been up to?

, If she doesn't answer and your call goes to voicemail, leave her a short and cute message. She will appreciate that you were thinking of her and enjoy hearing your voice.


If you have been dating for a while, you can say: Just calling to tell you I love you!

If you are in a new relationship, leave a more casual voicemail: I just wanted to see how you're doing! I miss you!

Let her know the best time to call you back, so you don't wind up in a game of telephone tag: I'll be home from soccer practice at 7. Maybe talk to you then?


, People are social animals and are hardwired to crave small talk with strangers.Small talk creates a sense of connection as people get to know one another. Even superficial conversation can be meaningful in new relationships. Stick to easy topics that will put her at ease:


Share a story from your day.
Ask her about her favorite sports team.
Talk about events at your school.
Discuss a TV show or movie you have both seen.

If the conversation gets boring:Don't: interrupt or abruptly end the call.Do: ask questions that lead to an interesting topic.


, Let her know you enjoy her conversation and her company. Without coming on too strong, say things that will encourage her to open up to you:


You tell the best stories!
That’s hilarious!
I’m dying to hear what happened next!

You are so easy to talk to.

Don't: repeat the same generic compliments every conversation.Do: say I love how excited you get talking about __.



, If you two have chemistry, small talk will flow into deeper conversation. Allow yourself to shift from casual banter to more personal subjects. Take advantage of openings that allow you to get to know each other better:


I take guitar lessons too! Why did you pick guitar over all the other instruments in the world?
You get your license in three months? Where would you go if you had a car?
School break is only two weeks away! Where are you going for the holidays?

, She will only be as honest and revealing as you are. Most people don’t express their true feelings because they fear rejection, not because they aren’t interested.If you tell her know how much she means to you, she will feel safe to tell you the same.


Every time I see you my world lights up.
You are the most beautiful girl in this city.
I feel like you understand me better than anyone else.

, Frame questions so your girlfriend feels free to elaborate, provide backstory, and express feelings. Don’t stall the conversation with questions that she will likely answer with just yes or no.

Don't: start with leading phrases like I bet you... or You must have...Do: use How..., Why..., and What... openers., Conversations are two-sided, and listening is as important as speaking. Don’t interrupt or talk over your girlfriend. Pay attention to what she says, and wait until she has finished her thoughts to ask questions. Encourage her to share more.


What happened next?
How did that make you feel?
Why do like In-N-Out milkshakes best?

, You want to be honest with your girlfriend, but you don’t want to offend her or make her feel uncomfortable. Gauge her enthusiasm throughout the conversation. If she sounds excited about a topic, explore it more. If she becomes quiet or unsure and says I don’t know, Maybe or I guess a lot, steer the conversation to more enjoyable territory.


Identify sensitive subjects as you get to know your girlfriend better and stay clear. You want your conversations to be positive experiences. Dredging up bad memories (her parents’ divorce, an ex-boyfriend, her deceased grandmother) is not a shortcut to intimacy. Let her know she can tell you anything, but don’t stir up unhappy emotions deliberately.
Coming on too strong may scare her off. Don’t sound obsessed or overly needy. Don’t make comments about her body that are too forward and that she would not appreciate.

Don't: be afraid to open up about your own emotions and life experiences.Do: pay attention to her comfort level, and adjust for future conversations.


, Making plans together, whether for a night out or for a lifetime, creates closeness in a couple. Discuss where you would live and travel if you could go anywhere, what kind of dog you want, or what your dream home looks like. Have fun and use your imagination. Keep the conversation light and flirty: you don’t need to come up with a road map for your lives. Tell your girlfriend how much you look forward to your adventures together.

Don't: start talking about marriage or moving in together before the topic has come up in person.Do: talk about your future in a playful way.

, It is always better to say goodbye while you still have things to stay to one another. You will look forward to your next conversation. Suggest what you can talk about on your next phone call.

, Let her know she is special and you appreciate her conversation. She will be more inclined to call you if she knows you want to hear her voice.


I look forward to chatting with you soon! Call me anytime.
I’ll be thinking of your sweet voice all night.
Don’t be a stranger.
I’ll text you tomorrow morning!

, Say something sweet just before you hang up that you know will make her happy. Share an inside joke, tease her with a nickname she likes, or compliment her so she blushes.

Prepare for changes in your partner.,
Prepare for changes in yourself.,
Communicate as much as possible.,
Enjoy every minute of time you have together.,
Continue planning for the future.",How to Cope when Your Boyfriend Joins the Military," Often your significant other will receive forewarning before they must enter military service. Use this time wisely. Avoid the temptation to fight or criticize one another. Try to understand what your partner is going through. In some places, a military career is not one that is selected by choice. Do not dwell on the concept that you might lose one another. Instead enjoy the time you have together and grow closer as a couple. Work to connect on deeper emotional levels, and try to look forward to the future with optimism.;
, When an individual enters military service they are often required to move away from their home, sometimes for several years. Be prepared for this. Work to establish plans. It may be worthwhile to create a plan and apply for jobs near where they will be stationed. Do not do this immediately though. Wait till they have reached their new base and are stabilized, otherwise the move could create undue stress for your service member while they are trying to integrate into a new unit. Talk it out and wait for their go-ahead.

, Nearly every Army in the world has some sort of Basic Combat Training. This is designed to take civilians and teach them how to survive in combat, while enforcing discipline and preparing them to be effective soldiers. This initial training is generally designed to be difficult and it can be a life altering experience for many recruits. Be prepared for these changes. Do not blame your partner for them; these changes often symbolize adaptations they had to make in order to survive the rigors of training for combat.

, When your partner leaves you will have to find a sense of independence to keep going. Just as they are having to adapt to a new environment, you will be doing so as well. It is good to have a support network here, and it definitely helps if you set this up beforehand. Try to locate mutual friends and family members that know you both well. If it was just you and your partner, things can get very lonely if you have no one to talk to. Although you may feel the urge to stray away from your partner, strive not to do so. Leaving them while they are away may make them feel abandoned and betrayed.

, Many initial training programs limit communications with loved ones in order to simulate the rigors of war. Despite this, it is important to use whatever means possible to continue communication. Openly share your feelings and try not to hide anything. This can be a very stressful time, and if it seems like something is being held back it can compound that stress, creating unnecessary fights and heartbreak. If your partner is deployed to a combat zone, be prepared for sparse communication. If letters or phone calls are sparse, it does not necessarily mean that your partner no longer cares about you. It could just be that the logistical structure required to maintain that communication is lacking.

, Occasionally, your loved one may get blocks of leave where they can return home. Enjoy the time you have with them and use it to connect as a couple. Know though, that often they will want to see family and friends as well. Do not get upset about this, because odds are they have not seen their family for the same amount of time that they've been missing you. Do take time for yourselves though. Celebrate the strength you both have found by facing this tribulation.

, Always keep looking forward. Having a mutual goal can help you and your partner feel closer as a couple, and give you something to look forward to that will inspire and drive you every day. Make sure these goals are realistic, and that you discuss them with each other.

Track your cycle.,
Monitor your mucus.,
Use an ovulation kit.,
Track your temperature.",How to Conceive when in a Long Distance Relationship2," It is possible to conceive while you are in a long distance relationship. To increase your chances of becoming pregnant, you need to follow several steps to monitor your body to help improve your odds. Learning to track and monitor your menstrual cycle is one of the most important things you can do to monitor your fertility.Tracking your cycle will help you figure out when you are ovulating. Ovulation is when your body releases a mature egg that is ready for fertilization.
Ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of your menstrual cycle. Most women have a cycle of about 28 days.
You are most fertile in the three days immediately before ovulation. Typically, these are the 11th, 12th, and 13th days of your cycle.
Make a note on the calendar on the first day of your period. This is the first day of your cycle.
Many women have irregular periods. This can make it more difficult to predict ovulation.
You are most fertile in the days leading up to ovulation. This is the ideal time to have sex. If you have to choose only three days a month to be with your partner, choose the three days prior to ovulation.

, Paying attention to your body can help you figure out the best times during the month to have sex. You can then plan visits with your partner during those times. Monitoring your cervical mucus is another natural way to help keep track of your most fertile days.Cervical mucus is a thick, fluid like substance released by your vagina. In the days leading up to ovulation, this mucus is more likely to be clear and slippery. It may look like egg whites.
On your least fertile days, the mucus will be thicker and cloudier. You may produce no mucus at all after you are done ovulating for the month.

, You can purchase an over the counter product that can help predict ovulation. Most drugstores sell ovulation kits. Ask your pharmacist if he recommends a particular brand.Using an ovulation kit can help you figure out your most fertile days. You and your partner can try to plan to be together on those days.
Follow the directions on the package of your kit. You will be testing your urine.
You will either collect your urine in a small cup or you will urinate on a stick. Most kits recommend that you try to test your urine at approximately the same time each day for the most reliable results.
After waiting the specified amount of time, the test will indicate whether you are in your fertile window or not.

, Another natural way to chart your most fertile days is by keeping track of your body temperature. Basal body temperature is the temperature of your body when it is at rest. This number fluctuates throughout your cycle. Take your temperature each day to help predict ovulation.Your body temperature is lowest during the first days of your cycle. It will increase after ovulation.
Typically, your body temperature will be 96-98 degrees before ovulation and 97-99 degrees after ovulation.
It is important to take your temperature at the same time and using the same method each day. Keep track of what is normal for your body.
Purchase a thermometer that specifically takes basal body temperature. These are available at most drug stores, and you can select an oral or rectal thermometer.

Eat right.,
Be physically active.,
Increase sperm mobility.,
Take the pressure off.,
Consider alternatives.",How to Conceive when in a Long Distance Relationship3," In addition to having regular sex, there are other things you can do to make your body more receptive to conception. You can take these steps regardless of how often you and your partner see one another. When you are trying to conceive, it is important to eat a healthy diet.A diet composed of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and grains can help ensure that your body functions properly. This includes your reproductive health.
3 months to a year before you plan to start trying to conceive, review your diet to see if you need to make any changes. Ask your doctor to help you if you have questions about proper nutrition.
Folic acid is an important nutrient for women. This nutrient is found in leafy greens (spinach), citrus fruits, and whole grains.
You should also aim to get plenty of calcium. Try to consume 1000 mg a day by drinking skim milk and eating dairy products such as low-fat cottage cheese.
Males should consume plenty of antioxidants, such as those found in berries. This can increase sperm health.

, Keeping your body healthy can increase your chances of conception. Make sure that you are exercising regularly to stay in good shape. Work with your doctor to determine your ideal weight.Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity in each day. Take a brisk walk or enjoy a yoga or spinning class.
Be careful not to overexercise. Women who have regularly exercise vigorously may stop ovulating. This usually only occurs with extreme regimens, such as training for a marathon.
Regular exercise can also benefit sperm health. Both partners should aim to be physically active in order to increase the chances of conception.

, There are many things that males can do to increase the odds of conception. Consider ways to make your sperm more healthy. For example, maintaining a healthy body weight helps your sperm be more productive.Avoid smoking and alcohol. Both of these can lower sperm counts, which decrease your odds of conception.
Cool off. Try to keep your scrotal area from being too warm. Avoid hot tubs and sitting too long. Loose fitting underwear may help mobility.
Avoid using lubricants during sex. Further research is needed, but it is possible that some products can impede fertility.

, When you are trying to conceive, that can seem like the most important thing in the world. But try to remember that your relationship with your partner is important on many levels. Make sure to continue to have conversations that don't revolve around ovulation.Conception can be stressful. If one of you needs a break from trying or discussing trying, that's ok. Just be open and honest about your needs.
Keep the romance alive. Try to schedule fun activities when you are together. For example, go to a movie or go bowling. Spend time doing things that don't involve sex.
Check in with each other. Make sure that you and your partner emotionally support one another on this journey.

, If you are having trouble conceiving, remember that you have options. Talk to your doctor and your partner about things that you can do. It is entirely possible you just might need more time.If you are having trouble conceiving naturally, your doctor can recommend several types of treatment. She might offer a course of drug therapy, for example.
There are other options available to you, such as surgical procedures and Assisted Reproductive Therapy.
There are many ways to grow your family, including adoption and foster care.

Don’t offer false hope.,
Default to ""I"" statements.,
End the conversation.,
Do not allow a partner to abuse you.",How to Break up With a Long Distance Boyfriend/Girlfriend2," If you are no longer happy in a relationship and have decided to end it, focus on sending these messages. For instance, “This just isn’t working out for me anymore.” Include specific reasons if you have some, but keep everything you say focused on the fact that you have decided to end the relationship.In particular, avoid saying things like “I may feel differently someday.”
In general, avoid language about temporary breaks, as this may unfairly lead your partner to continue hoping for a relationship that you’re intentionally moving away from.
If you only want to take a break, be clear about this, and understand that your partner may not be available in the future. Be sure to tell them if you feel differently at any point.
If the conversation happens in person and you feel physically unsafe at any time, leave. If a partner hits you, end all contact with them immediately and report the abuse to the authorities if you are able to do so.

, When you’re the one breaking up with someone, keep the focus of your statements on you. Say things like, “I’ve decided to focus my time and energy on a different part of my life.” In short, make sure your statements indicate that you’re taking personal responsibility for the decision you’re making.I statements are worthwhile even if you’re breaking up with someone because of something that has more to do with them. For instance, say, “I won’t allow myself to be treated like this anymore.”
Avoid statements such as, “You’re just not in tune with my needs” or “You seem to be going down your own path.” Sentences that again with the word “you” risk sounding accusatory. Since they place blame on your partner, they are likely to lead to reactionary feelings of defensiveness, and may lead to an argument.

, If the conversation isn’t going anywhere, you may need to end it. You should respect your partner by hearing them out. However, if they start to speak in circles or become too emotional or agitated to have a productive conversation, it's likely time to excuse yourself.


Your partner may have a hard time hearing what you’re saying. They may continue asking why you’re ending the relationship, for instance. If this occurs, repeat the reasons you’ve stated and make sure you’re clear that the decision has already been made.For instance, ""We've lost touch, and I don't feel the connection to you I once did. I've decided I need to be single right now.""

, Your partner may become upset. They are entirely within their rights in having an emotional response to your decision. Silence, disbelief, and anger are common emotions in a break up conversation. However, threats or abuse of any sort are not acceptable. If your partner begins calling you names or otherwise attacking you, end the conversation immediately."

Note the cost of an LDR.,
Admit different preferences.,
Admit that you need a more physical relationship.",How to Break up With a Long Distance Boyfriend/Girlfriend3," There are a handful of challenges that are inevitable within a long distance relationship. If some of these are reasons you may not be able to stay in a relationship, be honest. Pragmatic reasons for a breakup can help lessen the sting of separation. If you just don’t have the time or money to stay in a committed LDR, tell your partner explicitly.For instance, say something along the lines of “I can’t afford to be in a long distance relationship any more.” Offer more specific reasons too; “I need to buckle down at work, and I can’t spend the time a relationship requires.”

, If may simply seem as though the two of you are becoming more comfortable in separate cities. If you decide you wouldn’t want to move for the sake of the relationship, it’s worth communicating this to your partner. If neither of you are willing to relocate, it may be better for both of you to separate. Say something like ""At some point, this relationship isn't going to be sustainable. It already feels like we're drifting apart. For these reasons, I want to break up.""

, Even when living within the same city, some couples prefer to get together infrequently. On the other hand, many partners prefer constant close proximity and physical contact. If you realize you’re not getting enough skin time to keep you content, point it out.Say something like “I need more a more physical relationship, and the distance between us is too great to make this work for me.”

If you try to kiss a girl in front of your friends, she'll think you're trying to show her off as a trophy. Instead, make it seem like an intimate and special moment by making sure you're alone with her. Pull her away from the pack with these tactics:


Tangle your hands up in hers, pull away, and look into her eyes.
If you're with a group, ask her to hang back with you for a minute.
Even when you are surrounded by people at least try to touch her, like hands, shoulder etc, confidently to sub-communicate your intentions.
In school you can ask her to go to your locker with you or a walk around the school. It's very romantic in the summer or in autumn.
Ask if you can walk her home, whether it's from school, work, or a party.
Or, if all else fails, ask her out on a date if you want! That way you're guaranteed alone time.;
, Make sure the atmosphere around you is romantic, and half of the hard work is done! Going through the effort to set up an enchanting scene communicates how you feel, as well as making it easier for her to see you in a flattering way. Here's how to do it:


Find a softly-lit place. It's probably possible to come off as charming in broad daylight, but it's not easy. Instead, find a setting that has forgiving lighting that conveys a sense of romance. Try these ideas:
Sunsets are considered universally romantic, especially if you have a good viewing point
If it's a full moon, you could rely on the moonlight — you should still be able to see after your eyes adjust.
If it's a rainy day, find shelter under a porch or in a car. The small amount of light filtering through the rain should be shimmery and soft.
If you're camping or at a bonfire, make use of the flickering firelight! To recreate the look indoors, you can light a few candles.

, If you want a kiss any time in the next hour, steer the talk away from anything that she might find disgusting or revolting. A quick review of what to do:


Do not talk about:

How amazing you think other girls are. Seriously, don't ever bring this up.
Everything that's wrong with your life/all the stuff you don't like. Complaining isn't sexy.
Stuff that you'd discuss with your guy friends.
Bodily functions. Ever.


Do talk about:

How amazing you think she is. For how to pay a great compliment, keep reading.
Her interests and thoughts. If you're ever at a loss for words, ask what she thinks about something or just say you like her hair.
Things you two have in common, such as shared experiences or hobbies.
There could be millions of things to talk about movies, music, sports, wine, food, interests, games, sex, relatives, crazy things, memes, random things, etc. still if you run out of things to say try to talk about the place where both of you are at present. If you are at some restaurant, beach, a slogan you saw basically anything which you would find funny.



, Everyone loves to be complimented, and girls are no exception. A compliment is the perfect way for you to hint that you want to kiss her, while making her feel beautiful and adored. Here's a quick primer on how to do it:


Focus on something you genuinely like about her. If you can, try to make it something that's special and unique about her, compared to other people you know. A compliment that you truly mean will always sound better than something you make up, so choose carefully.

Do not build your compliment around physical features such as her butt, her figure, her weight, etc. If you're going to use her looks, stick to her eyes, her hair and her smile; don't venture out of those three areas for now.


Think about the phrasing. You could just say, ""Hey, I like your smile,"" but that's not exactly memorable. You want the compliment to be something she remembers the exact wording of, because it made her smile. Here are some examples that are better worded:

""Your smile is completely dazzling.""
""Your laugh is my favorite sound in the world.""
""Honestly, your eyes sparkle like the stars.""



Say it in a romantic way. Delivery matters — the nicest compliment in the world can fall flat if you rush or mumble. Try these methods:

Lower or smooth the tone of your voice slightly. Doing this conveys a sense of intimacy.
Lean in slightly when you say it. If you do this, you can also turn down the volume of your voice a bit. Another trick that makes the compliment seem private.
If you're feeling really brave, you can lean in and whisper it in her ear. Doing this is a good test for whether or not she likes having you that close to her face. If she responds well, you're probably clear to try for a kiss.



, Most girls like guys who are spontaneous. One example would be if you are walking with her and there are not many people around then stop her abruptly, put your arms around her waist and pull her towards you and go in for the romantic kiss. If she denies don't think of it as a big deal (because it's not), and don't feel bad about it. She is still with you, isn't she? Try again after some time in a different way.

, If you're unsure about whether she wants you to kiss her, try doing a few small touches first. If she seems to like having you in her space, you can move forward. Here are some possible moves, listed from least intense to more intense:

, If you're walking next to her and she has her hands at her side, casually grab one. Or, if you're sitting by each other and she doesn't have her arms folded, go for it.

, No need to make a big deal about it — if she's sitting close to you, go ahead and rest your arm lightly on her shoulders. If she snuggles in closer, you can hold her more firmly.

, Hold it for four or five seconds before letting go. If she seems to like it, you can try moving in for a kiss.

, Note that you won't be able to pick these up on every girl — some might be really shy and closed off about their feelings, even if they are interested in a guy. But here are some common signals that you're headed in the right direction:


She starts conversations, makes a joke, or otherwise tries to get your attention.
She glances at you, and quickly looks away when you look at her.
She blushes when you talk to her.
She bites her lip.
She pushes her hair back a lot.
She leans in for more contact whenever you try to touch her.
Her breathing and heart rate get faster when you're close.

, If going from a hug to a kiss on the mouth seems like too big of a leap, you can try a ""small"" kiss first.


Slowly raise her hand to your mouth and lightly (that is, absolutely no spit) kiss the back of it. This seems like an old-world and chivalrous gesture, and most girls love it.
Kiss her on the cheek. Try not to pucker and ""smack"" like you would if you were kissing a relative. Instead, keep your lips soft and your pressure light. If you're extra brave, you can angle downward toward the side of her mouth or up toward her ear.

, Before you move in to kiss her, lock eyes. This is a clear signal that you're thinking about kissing her. If she backs away or abruptly changes the subject, hold off on the kiss. If she seems receptive, though, keep moving forward.

, Move your face closer to hers at a slow pace, so that she has plenty of time to back away. (Tilt your head slightly, opposite of her tilt, otherwise your nose would be in the way.) Stop just before you reach her lips.


If she backs away or starts talking, that's a no. Don't take it too hard, and try again another time.
If she doesn't move, that probably means you can go ahead and kiss her. (Or better yet, she might move in the last little bit and kiss you.)

, This is particularly important if this is your first kiss with this girl — you don't want to seem aggressive or unskilled. Lightly graze your lips over hers, keeping the pressure as soft as possible. After you've done that a few times, shift your focus to gently kissing her lower lip, so that it's between both of yours.


Try to avoid smacking as much as possible — the sound can be distracting.

, Don't just let your hands sit at your sides like limp noodles — use them to make your kiss even better! Here are some good places to put them:


On the sides of her face, so that you're cupping her jaw in both of your hands.
On the back of her head, so that they're tangled up in her hair.
On her shoulders.
On her waist.
If she seems interested in the kiss but also seems shy or timid, here's a move you can try: use your hands to grab her hands, and put them up on your shoulders. It's a quick and easy way to get her to move in closer, and makes it so that you're the one putting yourself out there and risking rejection — saving her the potential embarrassment.

, If you're ready to move into a more passionate liplock, you can attempt the French kissing. Gently run the very tip of your tongue over her lower lip a few times. She'll get the message, and open her mouth a bit more, if she's interested.

, As unbelievable as it sounds, you will need to take a break or stop kissing at some point. Instead of just breaking off abruptly, though, you can do it in a way that seems cute.


Pull your lips away, but rest your forehead against hers. Stay there for a few seconds while you catch your breath.
Pull away and put your cheek against hers, so that your mouth is next to her ear. (If you want to pay her another compliment or tell her how amazing she is, now's a good time!)

, If you're ending the kiss, try to do so with a gentle caress. Run your fingers through her hair, stroke her cheek with your fingers, or softly kiss her cheek. It seems like a small step, doing something like this can help end the kiss on a positive note and get her looking forward to next time. Don't rush into things! Girls like to take their time with things.

Get caught looking (briefly) at the other person's lips.
Don't purse your lips. Keep them softly parted — not so much that you could breathe comfortably through the opening, but enough that you could bite your bottom lip easily.

Make your mouth appealing. Use chapstick or lipgloss to smooth over flaky lips, and keep your breath fresh with mints or spray. Avoid gum, which you might have to spit out awkwardly if the other person goes in for a kiss.;
, If you're feeling brave, test the waters with a small kiss on the hand or the cheek. If the other person seems interested, it's probably safe to proceed with a kiss on the mouth.



If you're kissing a girl: Take her hand and slowly lift it to your mouth. Gently press your lips into the back of your hand for 2 or 3 seconds before breaking away.

If you're kissing a guy: Lean in and plant a 2- or 3-second kiss on his cheek. Keep your lips soft, and avoid puckering like you would if you were kissing a family member. If you want your intentions to be extra clear, aim for the part of his cheek just to the side of his lips.

, Go big and pay the other person the sincerest compliment you can think of. If you get it right, the other person might take the lead and lean in to kiss you.


Say it in an intimate way. Lower the volume and tone of your voice slightly, and lock eyes. Not only does this communicate that you have deep feelings for this person, it entices him or her to come closer to hear you.
Focus on an alluring quality. Even if you truly think that your date is an amazing basketball player, now might not be the best time to bring it up. Instead, base your compliment on how you see your date as a romantic partner. Try these lines:

""You are SO beautiful.""
""Your eyes drive me crazy.""
""I love to see you smile.""
""I can't even believe I'm lucky enough to be with you right now.""



, If all else fails, go for broke and state your intentions. If your date hasn't picked up on any of your hints and you're dying to lock lips, you might as well be straightforward and just ask if you can kiss him or her. Don't worry, though — you can be direct while still being romantic and compelling. Try these phrases if you're at a loss for words:


""I'd love nothing more than to kiss you right now.""
""I'm sorry if this is too forward, but I'd really like to kiss you.""
""I want to kiss you so much that it is just about killing me.""

, Don't waste any time once you have the go-ahead — close your eyes, lean in and smooch! The next sections will discuss some kissing techniques, as well as how to handle kissing in different dating situations such as a first kiss or kissing after a date.

, Tense puckers are for family members or people you're obligated to kiss, but keeping your mouth slightly parted and soft communicates a sense of openness.

, Start slow with soft, gentle kisses and skip the tongue and the teeth — for now. If your partner seems receptive, you can move forward to French kissing.


Try to avoid letting your lips smack. The noise can be distracting, and might break your immersion in the moment. If you do find yourself smacking, slow down and part your lips a bit more.
Stay light at first. Avoid smashing your lips against your date's mouth — for now. Kissing softly and gently gives the other person the chance to stop if it's uncomfortable, as well as allowing you to gauge his or her interest.

, Slobbery puppies are the last thing you want your date thinking of while you kiss him or her. Avoid this fate by swallowing excess saliva occasionally. If you notice that your lips are a bit too wet, pull away and discreetly purse them to bring the extra spit back into your mouth.

, If your initial kisses have gone well, try a lip lock, which can lead to closer kisses (and is a nice gateway for French kissing). Basically, you'll ""stack"" your lips so that (for instance) it looks like this:


Your lower lip
Your partner's lower lip
Your upper lip
Your partner's upper lip
At first, putting your date's lower lip between yours is the safest bet. Most people have larger lower lips, making them easier to grab gently with your lips.

, Ideally, you'll be able to breathe softly through your nose while you're kissing. If that's not possible, though, break away for a second to take a breath.


Don't feel self-conscious about being out of breath or needing to take a break for a second. Breathing hard is an indication that you're nervous and excited, which your partner will probably find flattering.

, Don't just let your hands hang at your sides like two limp fettuccini noodles — put them to good use!


Place your hands lightly on your partner's shoulders or around his or her waist. (In Western culture, girls generally put their hands on a boys shoulders while he puts his hands around her waist.)
Take the intimacy up a notch by pulling your partner in closer.
Put your hands on the sides of his or her face, using your thumb to sweep across the cheekbone, or put one hand under his or her chin and tilt it upward.
Another seriously sensual move is to put both hands around the back of your partner's head and tangle them in his or her hair, gently pulling.

, Once you're in a lip lock with your partner's lower lip between both of yours, lightly run the tip of your tongue over it. If you can move it slowly, even better.


See how your partner responds. If he or she presses in closer or returns the gesture, you're probably clear to keep increasing the intensity of the kiss. If your date pulls away, maybe it's best to pull back the tongue for now and stick to lips-only kisses.

, Using your tongue during a kiss is, in Western culture, referred to as a French kiss. Why do the French get the credit? Who knows! Here's how to get started:


Sweep your tongue along the inside of your partner's lower lip. Try to move slowly and lightly at first, increasing speed and pressure only if your partner seems to respond well.
Slide the tip of your tongue inside your partner's mouth and gently move it against the tip of his or her tongue. Use light, darting motions and keep your tongue moving — letting it sit limply in your partner's mouth isn't appealing and will bring a quick end to the kissing.
Try deeper and harder strokes if your partner seems responsive.

, Don't feel obligated to keep the intensive tongue activity going forever. Alternate soft and hard, slow and fast, deep and shallow. You can even go back to using only your lips for a few minutes.


Alternating your technique will keep your partner from being able to predict what's coming next. Maintaining this sense of surprise and spontaneity helps your kisses avoid becoming stale.

, Teeth aren't a necessary element of kissing, but a grazing them over your partner's lip can introduce another unexpected element. Here are some quick pointers:


Keep the pressure as light as possible. Remember that you're aiming to nibble, not bite.
Move slowly. Again, keeping your pace gentle will help prevent accidentally chomping on your partner's lip.
When your lips are locked, place your teeth over your partner's lower lip and slowly pull back until your teeth are almost at the end of the lip. Pause for a moment, then resume kissing as usual.
Don't break out the biters too much. They should be an occasional perk, not the main attraction.
Be prepared for rejection. Not everyone likes a side of teeth with their kisses. If your partner doesn't respond well, try not to be too offended — it's probably a matter of personal taste, not a lapse in your technique.

, Pull away for a moment to look into your partner's eyes, whisper something in his or her ear, or simply catch your breath and marvel at your good fortune.


Instead of putting a damper on the action, these small moments can actually make kissing more intimate. It gives your partner the sense that you see him or her as a complete person, and not simply something to kiss.

, Smooching someone you trust can ease a lot of the anxiety of your first kiss. If you knew you were giving someone his or her first kiss you'd try to be patient and understanding, so expect the same of your partner.


Keep in mind that an awkward first kiss isn't the end of the relationship (or the world). Actually, it can build intimacy through having a shared experience. As long as you can laugh it off, you'll be fine.
Remember, everyone has gone through having their first kiss. Odds are that most people are more awkward about it than you'll be, even if you don't know it.

, Use chapstick or lipgloss to smooth over chapped lips, and brush your teeth and tongue well. If your mouth feels a little stale, use breath mints or spray to freshen up.


Knowing that your mouth is clean and appealing can help you feel more confident about kissing.
That being said, though, don't feel like you need to obsess over cleanliness. Most mouths just ""taste"" warm, unless you've recently eaten something pungent (like onions or garlic) or you've just woken up in the morning.

, You only get one first kiss! Unless you’re both so overwhelmed with desire that you have to kiss right now or the world will end, draw it out. It can be tremendously exciting and sensual to tease the kiss before it happens, keeping eye contact the whole time.

, If you're nervous about not knowing the right techniques, let your partner initiate what happens during the kiss. Imitate what he or she does until you're comfortable trying your own moves.

, As you become more comfortable with kissing, try to take the lead on initiating kisses or working on new techniques. If your partner doesn't respond well, simply write it off as personal preference and try something else.

, Since the possibility of a goodbye kiss always beckons—and assuming it’s your desire—it’s best to start getting close sooner than later. Otherwise, you will find yourself saying your goodbyes with what feels like a chasm between you, making the swoop in for the kiss very conspicuous and awkward.


Guys, this is when you get the dreaded last-minute-turn-and-kiss-on-the-cheek routine, which is second only to the phrase, “You remind me of my brother,” for most-deflating date ending. As you walk your date to the car, the door, etc., put your hand (or a jacket) on your date’s shoulder or back. This breaks the touch barrier, gently lets your date know your intentions, and gives you an excuse to stand very close all at the same time.

, If your date angles his or her body away from you or speeds up to create distance, don’t try to complete the goodnight kiss—and don’t let your ego make a fool of you. Simply flash a big smile, thank them for the lovely time, and go about your business. It could simply be that your date isn’t ready to kiss yet.

, Making eye contact while standing close is a universally acknowledged indicator that a post-date kiss is about to take place.


If the eye contact becomes too long, break and reestablish it as necessary; it’s better to let your eyes dart around than subject your date to an interrogation-style stare down. One good way to break eye contact while maintaining the romance is to glance down at your date’s lips
It may feel awkward to make your desires so clear, just remember that by giving your date a heads-up, you will make the kiss go much more smoothly and improve the odds that it will turn into a glorious make out session. Trying to plant a kiss by surprise, on the other hand, may result in bumped noses and teeth, a startled pullback, and much awkwardness.

, When people get nervous, they often compensate by finding anything to talk about, killing the kissing opportunities.


While you shouldn’t try to end the conversation abruptly, which might come across as trying to get over with your goodbyes, you shouldn’t encourage your date to ramble, either.
Let the chatter die down by keeping your responses friendly but minimal.

, If everything is going well but you’re not quite ready to dive into full-blown romantic kissing, lean in for a hug and kiss the person on the cheek.


Don’t confuse this with a friendly peck smack in the middle the cheek; make your feelings clear by placing the kiss close to the ear or mouth and letting your lips linger for a second, or whisper something flirty in their ear with lips touching. This will help the other person know that the kiss isn't meant in a platonic context.

, If this is a first kiss with this person—or, more importantly still, a first date—don’t overdo it. Keep your lips softly parted and either plant a straightforward kiss on your partner’s lips or up the ante by gently locking lips.


Resist the temptation to kiss hard or with tongue, unless you've been chasing this person for quite some time. It might seem too forward and shut down future opportunities.

, Pay attention to how your date responds and moves during the kiss. If they lean closer or linger, you may be able to transition into more romantic kissing; otherwise, end the kiss by pulling slowly back, reopening your eyes to make eye contact, and smiling.

, Having your lips puckered keeps them tight and somewhat closed, indicating that you're unwilling to open your mouth for more intimacy. Most people will read a pucker as strictly platonic.


To know if you're puckering your lips correctly, kiss in the air. How loud is the kissing noise? It should be a clearly audible ""pop"" of your lips as you part them while sucking air in. A romantic kiss will barely make this noise because your lips are much more relaxed.

, If you want to kiss someone on the cheek and that someone is at risk of misinterpreting your intentions, make it clear that you're not going for the mouth by turning your head off to the side before you lean in. Try to plant the kiss squarely in the middle of the cheek so that it's not veering for more romantic areas such as the ear or mouth.


If you're uncomfortable actually kissing the other person's skin, try air kissing. Lean in so that your cheek is touching the side of the other person's cheek, and kiss the air with a few quick and audible puckers. For extra effect, pull back, switch sides, and do it again.

, The amount of time your lips spend on the other person's cheek or lips should be limited to whatever it takes to make that kissing noise described in the previous step—nothing more. If your lips linger, it won't seem so platonic.

, Bow or kneel before the other person. Look up in respect. Remain in this position during the kiss. Take the person's hand gently and bring it close to your lips.

Kiss him.",How to Hint for a Kiss from a Guy," Because of respect for your wishes (and the fear of rejection), a guy generally won't try for a first kiss unless he's pretty sure you want him to. If you do, you should try to make him feel comfortable and confident. Flirt with him, laugh at his jokes, smile a lot, and compliment him. If you put him at ease and let him know you enjoy being with him, he'll usually find the courage to try to kiss you.;
, Touch him lightly on the arm or shoulder when you're talking. Just make it a quick, innocent touch and don't make a big deal out of it. Holding hands is also a good way to break the touch barrier. The simple act of touching can strengthen the intimacy between you and him. Sometimes, a guy will break the touch barrier, and if you're comfortable with him doing so, touch him back. But don't wait for a guy to make the first move here, because girls can generally get away with breaking the touch barrier earlier in a relationship than guys can.

, When you're alone with a guy and want to be kissed, make eye contact and then move your gaze briefly down to his lips. Then move your eyes back up to meet his and smile demurely. You don't have to be really obvious about it—just a quick glance down at his lips is better than staring at them all conversation. Many guys will take the hint. If it doesn't work the first time, try again when the time is right.

, Drawing attention to your lips will serve to subtly remind your date that you'd like him to kiss you. Focus on physical draws rather than piling on lipgloss or lipstick.


Touch your lips. Gently run your fingers across your lips periodically, or play with your bottom lip. In moderation, these are both good ways to signal to your partner that you'd like a kiss. However, overdoing it will make it look unnatural and can be a huge turn off.
Bite your bottom lip. Again, you should do this softly and in moderation. Subtle, playful lip bites will draw his attention to your lips. It will also make your lips slightly redder and more plump without lipgloss or lipstick, making your lips more inviting without making him scared of messing up your carefully planned makeup.
Lick your lips. Try to avoid the clichéd, slow lick across the lips while giving sexy eyes. Not only is this hard to take seriously, but few people actually do it well. Instead, gently wet your lips once in a while with your tongue. You can then follow immediately with a subtle bottom lip bite if you want to drive the point home. Too much licking, though, can make you look crazed and hungry while making your lips slobbery and unappetizing. Try to use this one only as a last resort.

, If he's dropping you off after a date, linger for a moment. If you're in the car, don't get out right away. Instead, sit next to him and wait for a few seconds. Unbuckle your seatbelt and look at him expectantly. Making somewhat awkward conversation may seem painful, but it may be just the thing to spark him into kissing you; if the conversation is too passionate or exciting, there might not be enough pause for him to feel comfortable moving in for the kiss.


If he walks you to your door, fiddle with your keys for a couple seconds. This is a universal sign that you're asking for an after-date kiss. Look up once or twice to give him a chance to lean in.

, You have to be close to each other to kiss, and the less distance a guy has to travel to kiss you, the easier it is for him to give it a try. So get close. When the moment seems right, put your face close to his and look at him expectantly. If you're brave, you could try moving in as though you're going to kiss him.


Try this move during or just after a hug. Give him a long, intimate hug (avoid patting him on the back or just using one arm—these can both be interpreted as disinterest). Before unwrapping your arms or pulling your body away, lean your head back. This will give him a chance to lean in for the kiss. Worst comes to worst, you can just let go immediately with your body and arms, or else you can quickly kiss him on the cheek.

, If the guy isn't taking your subtle hints, bring up kissing in conversation. If you're watching a movie together and see an on-screen kiss, mention that it's ""so romantic"" or something to that effect. Alternatively, bring up your first kiss or a silly story about a bad kiss you've had. Then, bring up how much better you've gotten since then. It might be the feeder line he needs to lean in and see for himself.


If the guy is really shy, you might just want to put it on the line and tell him that you'd like him to kiss you.

, There's no law that says the guy has to initiate the kiss, and some guys--especially if they've never kissed a girl before--just won't take your hints. If you want to kiss him, just go ahead and do it.

, Items such as T-shirts can be hand-designed with a personal quote printed on to them which when worn will make them feel close to you.

Set a relaxed atmosphere.,
Take the lead.,
Teach them a fun lesson.,
Use the three strikes method.,
Practice frequently.",How to Deal With a Bad Kisser1," This is especially important if you’ve only kissed once. Was there something about the situation that might have meant the two of you didn’t bring your best game? This can be the case if the two of you were drunk, short on time or in a particularly awkward situation. Next time the two of you kiss, prepare beforehand.Make sure the two of you are comfortable, like on a cozy couch or a bed.
Dim the lights to set the right atmosphere.
Light candles and play romantic music.;
, Next time you kiss your partner, be proactive and drop hints about how you like being kissed. This is really important early, as it can prevent bad habits from developing. Make your kissing style known, and hopefully your partner will replicate it. If your partner doesn’t have as much experience as you, this can really help them develop their kissing ability., You can turn a potentially uncomfortable conversation into a playful demonstration. Focus on specific kissing styles you’d like your partner to emulate. Outline them verbally, then demonstrate.Open by telling your partner: “This is the kind of kissing I like” and demonstrate.
An example of a specific thing you can try and correct would go like this. Say: “This is how I like using my tongue.” and demonstrate.
For example, if you prefer to be caressed a certain way while kissed, demonstrate this on your partner.

, If there’s something specific your partner does that bothers you, use this method to bring it to light. The first time you tell them you don’t like something, this is the first strike. If you have to go through this process two more times, that’s two more strikes. If you get to strike three, it’s time to pull away and talk about what’s going on.For example, if your partner uses too much tongue, pull away, say “This is how I prefer to be kissed” as your first strike, then resume.

, The best way to make sure you both get the best out of any kissing venture is to actively practice. Set some time aside during each date specifically for making out with your partner. This will give you plenty of time to drop hints, and the practice might just help your partner shake some of the habits you’re not a fan of."
"
Figure out exactly what you don’t like.,
Redirect wandering hands.,
Show them how to use less teeth.,
Stop them from slobbering.,
Control their wild tongue.",How to Deal With a Bad Kisser2," It’s important not to stop at “they’re a bad kisser” if you’re hoping to solve the problem. Think of specific things your partner is doing that might bother you, so you can fix them. There are a few things that can go wrong in a kiss.Too much teeth. Teeth banging together can definitely be a turn-off.
Too much saliva. The last thing you want to say about a kiss is it’s slobbery.
Bad breath.
Too much or too little tongue.

, You might need to do this because you’re just not ready for that kind of contact, or your partner’s hands are less than gentle. Simply grab the hand(s) and redirect them towards a spot you’re comfortable with.For instance, you can take your partner’s hand to your waist, or maybe up to your face.


After redirecting their hands you can let them know you enjoy being caressed there.

, Bumping teeth usually happens because the two of you are very eager.There’s nothing wrong with that! But unless bumping teeth is a turn on for you, you might want to slow down just a tad. If your partner doesn’t take the hint, you can take your partner’s head in your hands and gently tell them to slow down.

, Too much saliva can happen when there’s too much tongue action and not enough lip movement. Try focusing on kissing their lips gently, toning things down a bit.If they follow your lead, you should be dealing with much less slobber.


If they don’t follow your lead, try pulling away a bit. Usually that’s enough of a sign to slow things down.

, Keep in mind that the amount of tongue that is acceptable in a kiss is very subjective. If your partner’s tongue isn’t doing too much, you’ll have to take the lead. Make sure your tongue has the first move; they’ll follow along.If the problem is their tongue going too wild, you have a couple of options. The first is to pull away noticeably.
They’ll either understand and slow down, or follow and keep their intensity.
If they do the latter, you can stop, and gently tell them to slow down."
"
Ask your partner what they like.,
Go over what you like.,
Look at ultimatum options.",How to Deal With a Bad Kisser3," If you haven’t been able to change your partner’s ways by dropping hints, you may need to talk to them about what they prefer. You’re not the only one involved in this kissing thing; your partner may just like things a bit differently than what you’re used to. Here are a couple things you can ask:


”Do you like the way I use my tongue?” You might find out that your expectations don’t exactly match up.
”Is there something you wish I was doing?” While you might be doing everything right, there might be a little extra your partner would like.
”Is there anything I do while we kiss that you don’t like?” This question is a bit more open ended, but opens the floor for honesty.

, Your partner can’t guess what you like. Dropping hints is subtle and won’t hurt anyone’s feelings, but sometimes it’s just too subtle. If you haven’t been able to change your partner’s ways, you might need to be more overt about your wishes.Be very specific, for instance mention exactly how passionate you expect kissing to be; otherwise it can feel rather forceful.
It’s important to approach this kind of sensitive topic with tact. Don’t be overly critical, and try to reinforce your partner’s positive behaviors.

, In the worst case scenario, you have two choices: lower your standards or break up with the bad kisser. If the person is wonderful in all other respects and if kissing just isn't that important to you, just live with it. If you really need a good kisser, you have to end the relationship.


If you try to communicate your needs early and the person still doesn't adapt, they probably won't be responsive to your needs in other areas either and won't make a good long-term partner for you anyway.
It's hard to break up with someone, but remember that you'll be better off and, hopefully, that person will also finally take the hint and become a better partner for someone in the future.

Understand when an air kiss is appropriate.,
Greet your acquaintance by name.,
Read the body language.,
Lean in for an air kiss.,
Kiss the air next to the cheek.,
Read up on the common cultural conventions.,
Observe the behavior of others.,
Search on the internet.,
Ask a native.",How to Air Kiss," Consider both the occasion and the nature of your relationship with each person you greet. Different occasions and different levels of familiarity warrant different greetings, so try to greet each person you meet according to how well you know them, and the specific occasion.


Air kiss at special, formal occasions. Typically, formal events (such as weddings, formal parties, and official ceremonies) that bring together people who are on good terms, but who otherwise don't see each other, is the common setting for air kisses. Less formal occasions (family get-togethers, neighborhood barbecues, and casual lunches) may warrant the traditional hug and lips-on-cheek kiss, especially if you see the person you're greeting on a regular basis.
Air kiss people you know, but don't know well. In most places, air kisses are not given to strangers. Instead, consider distant relatives, friends of your parents, or people to whom you've been introduced by a mutual friend as good candidates for air kisses. Family members and close friends might be offended at an air kiss' subtle implication that you don't know them well enough for a hug or a real kiss.;
, Before moving in for the air kiss, exclaim your acquaintance’s name and smile as you approach them. If you’ve forgotten their name, simply exclaim, “How great to see you!”, or “There you are!”

, As you approach, reach out with your hand, whether to touch or grasp your acquaintance's upper arm, elbow, or hand(s). If they recoil or tighten up in any way, consider defaulting to a loose hug or shoulder pat instead. If they seem relaxed and return your contact, an air kiss is probably in order. And if they embrace you affectionately or touch your face, prepare to kiss and be kissed, traditional-style.

, Aim to bring your lips near their right cheek (unless it's customary in your culture to start with the left). However, make sure that your acquaintance is also going for your right cheek to avoid an awkward halt as you both realize your faces are about to crash together. As you're going in for the kiss, it's not uncommon to brush cheeks gently.

, Purse your lips together and kiss the air just to the side of their face. Depending what's customary for the cultural context of the event, it may be appropriate to switch sides and repeat, going in for an air kiss on the opposite cheek.


Add sound effects. *Women sometimes make a discreet kissing sound (like ""muah!"") when they air kiss; it's generally seen as a friendly and feminine gesture to further embellish the greeting. Some men also do make that discreet sound, although it is not necessary.

, If you are visiting or moving to a foreign country, it would be wise to spend some time reading about what is common. This is also important if you have visitors from a foreign country. Knowing the correct greeting will help you fit in, and will make others more comfortable around you.In North America, it is common for acquaintances or close friends to give one or two air kisses, starting with the right cheek. Men and men generally do not kiss, though men kiss women and women kiss women often. Air kisses are more popular in large cities, as well as in parts of Quebec and New England.
In the United Kingdom, air kisses between upper class friends are common. It's considered unusual, though not unacceptable, for two men to air kiss.
In Spain and Italy, it's generally two kisses, starting with the right or the left cheek, depending on the region.
In France, it will be two, three or four kisses depending on the region. If you don't know, check first or go for two kisses. Usually the air kiss is done when meeting with women, but men air kiss each other as well. French people are usually air kissing when meeting and leaving at anytime of the day.
In the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland and Belgium, three kisses are expected.
In Southern and Eastern Europe, air kissing is a common form of greeting between friends and acquaintances.
In Jordan, it is one to the left cheek and several to the right, depending on how much you like the person.
In Latin America, it can be one, two or three kisses. This depends on the location and person. Air kisses are often used to greet new acquaintances, as well as close friends. Men are almost always expected to air kiss women upon greeting.
In Chile, Argentina and Uruguay, air kissing between men a la italiana, e.g., in the style of soccer players, is common.
In Greece it is customary for men to air kiss as well if they know each other well (e.g., distant male relatives, two good friends, etc.).
In the Middle East, air kissing between two people of the same gender is common. Air kisses between opposite genders are not permitted unless the kissers are closely related or married.
In the Philippines, air kisses are a popular form of greeting between adults who are close friends or relatives. In general, women kiss women or men kiss women. Elder relatives often air kiss younger relatives.
In Malaysia and Indonesia, it is expected that a younger relative will air kiss an older relative's hand as a show of respect. Exhale through the nose on the elder's hand; the lips are not pursed. Then press the elder's hand to your forehead.
In South, Central and East Asia, cheek kissing - even air kissing - is uncommon and could perhaps be considered offensive, though it is growing in popularity in metropolitan areas. Follow the lead of those around you.

, If you didn’t have time to do your research about a foreign culture, you can see what other people are doing. This can give you a good idea about whether or not an air kiss is appropriate.


For example, if you're approaching an entrance and the host is at the door greeting people, see how he or she is behaving.
Watch how people in the street greet each other, as well as how people in cafes greet each other. It will give you a good idea about the levels of intimacy.

, If you didn’t find the kissing etiquette for the place you are visiting above, a quick Google search should give you the information you need. Simply search “air kissing customs” + the name of the country/city you are visiting. Take these with a grain of salt though, as some information may not be true in all situations.


You can also do this quickly on your phone if you realize you forgot, and you're meeting someone important in 10 minutes.

, Don't be afraid to ask natives of the culture you are interested in about what is typical. While it may not be polite to ask what is appropriate in the moment, if you are having comfortable conversation, it is likely acceptable to politely ask them to explain the greetings that are typical for the culture you are visiting.


This may be particularly valuable if you are visiting a more remote area of a country, where the greeting habits may be less well-known.

Romance her.,
Flirt with her.,
Be confident.,
Kiss her.,
Touch her.,
Talk to her.,
Extend your touching.,
Use your own body language to tell her what you want.,
Remove her clothes, and repeat all previous steps.",How to Turn Your Partner On1," Taking her out to dinner and a movie is nice, but that's not where the romance is: the romance is in knowing how to treat her right. Listen to her. Ask her about her day, and ask her what she thinks about her favorite subject—whatever that may be. (You do know what her favorite subject is, don't you?) Compliment her on her looks, on how she dresses, or the way she smiles, as long as you are sincere.


Don't be too coy about the compliments. If that dress she's wearing makes her look hotter than Arizona in August, tell her. Don't be crude, but if she's packaged her assets to be admired, let her know that's appreciated!;
, Suggestive comments or even direct comments, sprinkled into your conversation, let her know that you find her desirable.

, You'll find women prefer their partners confident, not insecure. This may require bluffing, but keep this in mind: the more you ""bluff"" confidence, the more confident you will become. It's sort of a win-win situation!

, When the time is right, and you'll know when that is, kiss her. Do not go for a tonsillectomy on the first kiss—you'll be the guy she still laughs about 30 years later—but don't start with little butterfly kisses, either. Kiss her like you mean it, and tease her lips with your teeth and tongue.


Respond to her reactions: if she pulls away when you try to kiss her, it may not be time for that just yet. Go back to step one next time, and try again. If she does respond, pay attention to her body language. If she's kissing but guarded, don't continue to the next step until her body language lets you know it's ok to proceed.

, Caress her body, paying attention to the secondary erogenous zones first. Dig your hands into her hair, and pull her towards you, kissing her harder. Bunch her hair in your hands, and pull (gently—don't be a Neanderthal!). Pay attention to her neck, shoulders, and arms.

, Tell her how much you enjoy being with her, that you love the way she kisses, the way she looks, the way she sounds. Let her know that she makes you feel good, too.

, The inner arms, like the inner thighs, are fairly sensitive, and when kissed and stroked, can really start to heat things up. Continue exploring her body, gradually heating things up as you sense her getting more and more turned on.

, Pull her on top of you, so that whatever you want to kiss is near your lips. Roll yourself on top of her, and kiss her harder than you have so far.

, By now, the turn-on portion of the program is complete. We trust you to take it on your own from here. Don't forget to wear protection!

Be aggressive.,

Make some noise.,
When he starts removing your clothes, if you really want to turn him on—don't let him.,
Repeat often.

",How to Turn Your Partner On2," Let's face it—turning a guy on is easy, and it doesn't take us to tell you that! But if you're in the mood, and you want him to really please you, there are things you can do to really drive him crazy.

, He'll be giving you candy and compliments, and opening doors for you, buying you dinners and movies, and that's all part of what guys do. If you want him to keep doing that after you've been dating for a year or two, let it be know that you appreciate that sort of thing—or that you don't! Pretending is a sure way to kill any romance, if not in the short term, certainly in the long term. But for the sake of this article, let's assume you do. If he knows you like it, and you reward him with a kiss or a squeeze in the right place now and then, he'll keep it going.

, A little cleavage goes a long way. A lot of cleavage goes even further. Dressing provocatively will challenge him to keep his eyes raised up and looking into yours, will really help keep him in the zone, and can provide for some teasing fun as well.

, Be suggestive, maybe in the way you lick your spoon, maybe by simply saying you think he's hot. Again, guys are fairly primal, and it doesn't take a lot to arouse them. Just remember: he wants to be in control, but you get to say how much control he has.

, It's not a turn on at all to start kissing somebody who's insecure or not sure they are doing the ""right thing."" If turning him on is the goal, then show that. Don't hide your desires behind a wall of political or social correctness.

, Once he makes the first move, kiss him back exactly how you want him to kiss you. If you want hard, passionate kisses, kiss him hungrily. If you want little love pecks—at least to start—give them to him, and gently rebuff any attempts at harder kissing until you're ready for that.

, He likes to know that he's not the only one who is going for the gold. You don't need to knock him down and tear his clothes off—yet—but take the lead in the kissing department, and start exploring his body. If he works out, appreciate his physique. He'll like that, cause he's worked hard to be cut.

, When you're ready for more intimate touches from him, let your body language show it. Sometimes you may have to actually put his hand where you want it, but usually he'll get the picture.

, If you like what he's doing, you don't have to say ""I like what you're doing."" Simply say ""MMMmmmmm."" If you really like what he's doing, you can say a whole lot more. If you want him to talk dirty, initiate it so he knows it's ok.

, Instead, do it yourself. Purposefully, and seductively. When he goes to touch (and he will), deny him. Where he wants to touch you—you do it. Keep this up until neither of you can stand it anymore, then proceed with protection.

Your girlfriend should be more than an object of your lust. Even if you're intimate, keep a lid on it sometimes.
Greet her respectfully. When she enters a room, stand and kiss her hand. You could even nod or bow before her if you're feeling really royal.;
, Escort her holding hands while moving. Have a soft kiss on the back of her hand, if passion allows. Comfort her hugging from the back, gently.


Whenever need to touch, touch her softly. Be gentle and loving with your girlfriend.

,, Never be rude, give yourself a challenge that you will not be angry or tough to her. Never call her names or insult her, especially during arguments. This will come back to haunt you in a large way and is a fairly common mistake. It may even result in the loss of a relationship.

, When you are out in public with her on your arm, present her as someone you are blessed to be with, because you are!

, Gifts can be big or small, casual or significant. If you like your girlfriend and want to treat her right, show her that you care with a small token. Flowers, jewelry, and other small gifts are always appreciated.


Never forget to do the little things like buying her favorite candy, flowers, or any other sweet gesture for no other reason than that you love her.

, Bringing a lunch and coffee while they are at work is also always welcome. If your schedule doesn't allow this, packing an appropriate lunch with a note of affection will bring a warm smile to her face.

, Spend a decent percentage of your money on her. She'll appreciate the attention, time, and money that you've put into this endeavor. More importantly, she'll be happy to be with you.

, Massages are amazing! Shoulder, back, foot rubs shows an effort to put her in a state of bliss. Even if you don't know what you're doing, so long as you don't hurt her, she will tell you what to change and will still appreciate the attempt.

, Every once in a while (maybe twice a year or more, depending on how spectacular you make it), plan a trip for the two of you. Make it a weekend getaway or thrill her with an adventure somewhere further away like another country you know she really wants to visit. Get the hotel, the plane tickets, and time from her boss so she can go.

, If your girlfriend needs to vent, be there to listen. Ask her how she feels and show her that you care by taking her opinions and ideas seriously.


Acknowledge that she has your full attention.

,, This will show that you have a genuine interest in her and that you pay attention.

, Tell her that she alone possesses your heart (outside of any religious doctrines that you are affiliated with).

Ask him to kiss you.",How to Get a Guy to Kiss You," Remember to brush your teeth and tongue before you leave your house. Have mints or a pack of gum handy if you are heading to a party where you think a kissable guy might be. There is nothing worse than kissing someone with bad breath so do yourself a favor and harness that halitosis.;
, Ask him to hang out somewhere that will set the stage for a kiss--go for a walk, go see a movie, etc. If you are at a party, you can go in another room and ask him to come. Ask him to go outside with you or find some other way to get him alone (partners hide and seek anyone?) Having friends around will probably kill the mood and will also put a lot of pressure on him. If you really want to be kissed, find a way to be alone with your guy.

, Be confident and friendly. If you are nervous, try not to show it. Have an open, welcoming body posture--keep your arms and legs uncrossed, look into his eyes while you are talking and face your body towards his. Laugh at his jokes and compliment him. Compliment him on what you really like about him, for example: 'You look great in that shirt--it really brings out your blue eyes.' Make him feel comfortable.

, If you aren't already close to him, step closer, minimizing the space between you two. If necessary, create a ruse to get closer to him. Chances are, he’s probably trying to come up with a way to get closer to you too and your ruse may give him the opportunity to kiss you that he has been looking for.


If you’re outside, shiver and say you’re a little chilly and shuffle closer to him. If you’re indoors, say he has an eyelash or something on his face. Lean in and wipe it off, then look up into his eyes and don’t move away.

, The touch barrier is that invisible line that gets drawn between two people who are interested in each other. Be the first person to cross the line--touch your guy on the arm when you laugh, brush your leg against his if you’re sitting next to each other, etc. Touching him will let him know that you’re cool with physical contact (including kissing.) If your guy breaks the touch barrier first, respond in some way--perhaps touching him on the arm or brushing his hand with yours--to let him know that you are comfortable with what’s happening.

, Before you even think about kissing, make sure your lips look as tantalizing as possible. Dry, cracked and chapped lips are not very fun to kiss! Ensure your lips are well moisturized, applying some Vaseline or lip balm before bed to prevent them from drying out. Make your lips unavoidable. One of the classic ways to do this is to playfully bite your lip when you flirt with him. Make sure to make eye contact while doing this.If you guys have gone out to dinner, get something that will draw his attention to your lips. If you are eating something that is drip-prone (like ice cream, strawberries, watermelon, etc.) let a little juice get on your lips and then lick it off slowly. Just be careful not to look like you’re a hot mess who has a hard time eating without getting food on herself.
Apply some lip gloss while your guy is watching. His eyes will be drawn to your lips. Just be careful not to put too much lip gloss on--a lot of lip gloss can be very sticky. For a less sticky approach, use lip balm or chapstick.

, Eye contact plays a big part in getting your guy to understand that you want to be kissed. It shows that you’re confident, but also that you can play coy. One way to clue him in on the fact that you want a kiss is to look him deep in the eyes, slowly drop your gaze to his lips, and then move them back up to his eyes. If the guy catches on, this is his cue to kiss you. If not, then try again a little later. Don't do it over and over though, it could make him feel a little uncomfortable.


Another way to flirt with your eyes is to act bashful. Hold eye contact for a moment, then drop your eyes, smiling slightly. Glance back up and give him your best ‘come-hither’ look.


, Who said guys have to make the first move? If you want to be kissed, why don’t you kiss him first. Guys can get super nervous around girls they like so why not take the pressure off him and kiss him? Confidence is attractive. Go get ‘em girl.

, Flirting lets a guy know you’re interested in him without being too obvious. Engage in some light banter--tease him (but not cruelly). You could even tease him about the fact that he hasn’t kissed you (which should be a major hint to him that you want to be kissed.)



Flirt with him over text. Flirtatious, funny texts can be a great way to 1) let a guy know you’re funny, 2) show him that you’re interested, and 3) keep him thinking about you even when you are not together. Just be sure not to overload him with texts--that can feel overwhelming and be a bit of a turn off.

, Make your guy feel like he is the only guy in the world--and the strongest, sexiest guy at that. Giving him a confidence boost may give him just enough confidence to get up the nerve to kiss you!


Ask him to help you lift something or open something for you. When he has done whatever it is, say something ‘ooo look at those muscles.’ Even if you just say something complimentary like ‘I love your eyes,’ you are sure to stroke his confidence.

, Sometimes you just need to be direct. If you have given as many hints as you think you can drop without acting like a crazy person, its time to just ask for a kiss. Just keep in mind that being direct has its pros and cons. On one hand, you will get your answer (and hopefully your kiss) immediately--on the other hand, that answer may be ‘no.’ If he is a really shy guy, he may need to just work up to kissing you on his own. Another possibility is that he is not as into it as you thought he was--if that’s the case, don’t lose heart. There are plenty of other fish in the kissing sea.


You can make your question sound sexy while still making it clear that you want to be kissed like..right now. When you are close to him (such as when you are pretending there is something on his cheek--see Part One) lean in close to his ear so that your lips brush it gently and whisper “kiss me” or something along those lines. It is more than likely that that little brush of your lips and your bold request will drive away any lingering shyness he might have.
