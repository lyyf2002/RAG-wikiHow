Communicate.",How to French Kiss," A soft, smooth, and slightly moist mouth is ideal for kissing. Before you move in, you should make sure your lips aren't chapped or dry so your partner isn't distracted or put off by the state of your lips. If you want to soften your lips before you go in for the kiss, you should try these quick fixes:


Use chapstick. Swipe some over your lips and press them together. (If you're a girl and you have flavored chapstick, all the better!) The only caveat is that you should apply lip balm or gloss an hour or more before you kiss, so your kissing partner feels your soft lips, not the thick layer of gloss over them.
Drink water. Dry lips are a sign of dehydration, so throw back a tall glass of water (or two). You should notice your lips starting to smooth out within 20 to 30 minutes.
Lick your lips. If you're really in a pinch and have no time to spare, quickly run your tongue over your lips and press them together. This should moisten them slightly without making them slobbery or slick. You can even lick your lips a bit subtly while making eye contact with your kissing partner.;
, You never want to have bad breath when you are about to kiss someone, whether the kiss is a French kiss or not. Because your mouth will be open in a French kiss, fresh breath is especially important. Practice good dental hygiene. If you know you are about to kiss someone, take a second to brush your teeth or at least rinse out your mouth with water.


Always have breath mints or mint-flavored gum with you if you think there is a chance you might kiss someone while you are out. If you want to be subtle, you can quickly suck on a breath mint or chew gum for a minute in the bathroom, so you don't make it too obvious that you're ready to kiss.
Avoid foods that leave an unpleasant aftertaste or residue, particularly garlic, coffee, onions, milk, and corn. If you're on a dinner date before the big kiss, try to eat strategically.

, A good kiss—especially a first kiss or first French kiss—is the culmination of a building tension and growing intimacy. Choose your moment right to make sure you and your partner are both in a mindset to really lose yourselves in the kiss. You should have privacy and should both be feeling romantic instead of stressed or distracted, for one thing. When is the moment right? It depends on your individual situation, but here are a few signs to keep in mind:


You have complete privacy. Whether you're alone on your balcony or sitting on a secluded bench in a park, you're not worried that someone will interrupt you.
The other person keeps dropping hints, like locking eyes and looking at your lips, or standing or sitting progressively closer to you. Regardless of your partner's gender, their body language should give you a clue about whether now is the right time to make your move.
You're ending a date that went really well. In the car or on the porch are both good semi-private locations for a goodnight kiss.
It just seems right. If you feel overwhelmingly compelled to kiss someone, don't be too afraid to just go for it. (Just be prepared for an awkward or even troubling situation if you discover your intended didn't feel the same way.)
Ask. If you aren't sure whether the other person is feeling it, bring up the topic. Better to get permission semi-awkwardly and go ahead with confidence than risk missing out on your chance to kiss that special someone (accidentally kiss someone who isn't interested).

, Gaze deeply into the other person's eyes. If you want to make your intentions extra clear, slowly move your gaze to their lips, then back up to the eyes. You can even make intense eye contact, break it for a few seconds, and then look back at the person. This is a way of showing the person you want to kiss that you're pleasantly overwhelmed at the sight of them.


Girls can even look at a guy, look down, and then look up through their lashes to be extra flirtatious.

, If you're really excited about the prospect of kissing the other person, show it! A smile keeps the situation light and fun, while helping them feel safe and relaxed. Make sure your smile is soft and genuine, however, and not a forced, too-wide, or overly intense smile. Just slowly and languidly ease your lips into a smile. Show your future kissing partner how happy you are to be in their company. Continue to make eye contact as you do this, or break it for a few seconds before you return it.


You can opt for a close-lipped smile instead of smiling while showing your teeth, which might come off more as friendly than alluring or romantic.

, Once you're alone with the person you like and you're smiling and making eye contact, you can decide if you want to go in for the kiss without touching, or if you want to break the touch barrier first. This can mean sitting with your legs touching, holding hands, putting your hand on the person's knee, stroking the person's arm, or just giving a sign of affection. If you've kissed the person on the lips before, then breaking the touch barrier may feel more natural for you, and you should make an effort to touch the person before you touch lips so both of you feel more at ease.









You can also break the touch barrier as you're moving in to kiss the person. If you're standing, you can touch the person's arms, neck, or shoulders as you move in for the kiss. If you're sitting, you can put a hand on the person's back.

, When the moment seems right, go in for the approach. In general, you should be moving slowly enough that the other person has time to say no, but not so slow that the moment loses its spark. When you start to get the feeling that your kissing partner is ready for the next step, you shouldn't dilly-dally. Move your body toward their body until your heads are just a few inches apart. That's when you'll have to start angling your head for the best kissing position.









Take it slow. The slow approach builds tension and anticipation. Move in at a pace that gives the other person a chance to consent (or not). When they see you coming in, they may move to meet you, so going slow will prevent you from accidentally bumping heads.

, Meeting head-on will result in bumping noses. Instead, just tilt your head slightly to the left or right. If you notice the other person going in one direction, pick the opposite. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to do this perfectly. If you and your partner end up kissing each other head-on and bumping noses a bit, then you'll naturally adjust your heads into a more comfortable position, where your noses aren't in the way.









Unlike what you may think from the movies, this doesn't have to happen in slow motion. You'll tilt your head as you move closer to the person, not at a snail's pace, so you don't have to worry about having the time to get it perfect.

, Just before you make contact, close your eyes. Kissing with your eyes open is generally associated with dishonesty and insincerity, and keeping your eyes closed will help you focus on and enjoy what's happening on your lips. Also, while you may be tempted to open your eyes to see what your kissing partner looks like in the throes of passion, this could actually unexpectedly make you crack up or not feel in the mood to kiss anymore. Closing your eyes can also help you focus on your mouth and to live in the moment, instead of trying to observe everything that's happening at close range.


You can slowly open your eyes later, when you pull apart after the kiss.

, Don't present a stiff pucker, like you would if you went in to kiss your grandma — not only does it communicate non-romantic feelings, but it makes it physically difficult for your partner to initiate a French kiss. On the other hand, keeping your mouth completely loose and still also says that you're not interested. Here's how to hit a happy medium:


Pucker just a little. Push your lips forward slightly, so that you feel the slightest hint of muscle tension around them.
Open your mouth slightly. Instead of aggressively going in for a fully open-mouthed kiss at first, keep your lips just barely parted enough that a tongue could slip between them.

, Use feather-light pressure at first, so that your lips are just barely grazing over your partner's. This builds more anticipation and excitement than diving straight into a full-on French kiss. This also signals to your partner that you may be wanting more without being too forward about it.









Keep your movements slow. A lot of quick, light kisses don't have the same level of sexiness as a barely-restrained build in tension. Act like you have all the time in the world—the kiss will speed up soon enough.

, Once you've built a solid foundation for a French kiss with some tongueless kissing, you can give the other person some subtle hints that you're ready to kick it up a notch. In general, if it's your first time kissing the person, you should be a bit cautious before initiating a French kiss, because this may come off as too much too soon. But beyond that, here are some things to keep in mind as you test the waters to signal that you're ready to kiss with your tongue:









Open your mouth more widely. Offering unrestricted access invites the other person to make the first tentative tongue contact.
Lock lips, so that the other person's lower lip is between your two lips. Then, lightly sweep the tip of your tongue over the lower lip. Do one smooth, swift motion so that the contact lasts for less than a second. If they are interested, they'll reciprocate.
Know when to pull back. If you've tried both of the above techniques and your partner hasn't responded, simply leave it alone until next time and focus on regular kissing. Avoid making a big deal of it, or guilting them.

, If the other person seems interested, go ahead and start French kissing for real. Remember to keep your tongue in motion and your touches light. First, just slowly slide your tongue into your partner's mouth. You can either begin by placing it above or below your partner's tongue, or even move it around the tongue a bit if you're feeling bold. Just make sure your partner's tongue is reciprocating your actions so you're not just kissing a limp tongue, or the romance will dissipate pretty quick. Here are some things to keep in mind as you explore the French kiss:









Stay playful. ""Tag"" the other person's tongue lightly and retreat back, inviting them to make the next move.
Tongues are loaded with nerve endings, and the mere act of touching your partner's tongue with your own will be very pleasant.
Don't go too deep — jamming your tongue down the other person's throat is a big turn-off. Stay shallow and light at first. See how far your partner wants to go, and follow suit.

, If you’re kissing for an extended period, it’s easy to forget to breathe. Believe it or not, gasping and turning blue isn't very romantic. You may think that a truly passionate kiss involves many minutes of non-stop kisses, but if you really want to up the romance factor, then you have to stay alert and conscious. Once you fall into a rhythm, you should be able to find a suitable pattern for breathing without interrupting the flow of your kisses. Here's what you need to know:


Take small breaths through your nose as you kiss.
Don't be afraid to take a break. If you do it right, it can still be an intimate and sexy moment. Pull back slightly so that your foreheads are still touching, make eye contact, and smile.
As you and your partner grow comfortable with the kiss, you can try breathing through your mouth a little: sharing breaths as well can be romantic (but not everybody likes it).

, Kisses are like snowflakes: no two are exactly the same. Once you feel comfortable French kissing someone, it is tempting to try to do the same thing every time, but you should resist if you want to keep things interesting. You should be able to fall into a nice, comfortable rhythm while adding enough variety from time to time to keep things interesting. Here's what you can vary:









Speed: Varying the speed of your kisses is a good way to try something different without potentially intimidating your partner. Once you've got the slow kiss mastered, try going a little faster for a few seconds — it should leave you both a little breathless!
Depth: Once you're comfortable with someone, try kissing a little more deeply. The key to pulling this off is keeping your speed under control. Or, if you want things to be a little more flirty and playful, return to shallow kisses.
Pressure: Like a deep kiss, a hard kiss should be reserved for a situation in which you already know both you and your partner are comfortable. Be a little bit more forceful with your tongue, but be sure to keep it in motion.
Teeth: You may want to try rubbing the backs or front of the other person's teeth with your tongue. This can create a ticklish feeling that might enhance your kiss. You could also try lightly catching the other person's lower lip with your teeth. Be aware, though, that not everyone likes their kisses with a side of teeth — be prepared to put your chompers away.

, While you should keep your hands polite, especially on a first kiss, you don’t necessarily want them just dangling at your sides. Using your hands and touching your partner's body (while keeping it respectful) can enhance the romantic feeling of the kiss and can make you and your kissing partner feel more connected. Once you make contact with your partner's body, you can move your hands around gently from time to time without being frantic about it. Here's what you need to know about using your hands while you French kiss:









As a general rule, start with your hands on your partner's hips and then slowly move them around their back or up to the face and hair.
Another turn-on for the first kiss is to gently caress the other person's shoulder. It shows you are comfortable with them.
Cradle your partner's face with your hands on their cheeks and their neck.
Or, go for an old standby: simply wrap your arms around your partner in an embrace.

, Everybody kisses a little differently, and each person enjoys different things in a kiss — there is no ""right"" way to kiss. Good kissing requires give-and-take, so read your partner’s body language and pay attention to clues that tell you you’re doing something they like. The most important thing is to make sure that your kissing partner is comfortable with the pace of your kissing and affectionate gestures.


Not everybody likes to be kissed the same way, so while your former partner might have enjoyed one method of kissing, your new love might not. You need to learn to read signals and adapt to a style that's comfortable for each of you.
If your partner pulls away or seems uncomfortable at any time, understand that you have to slow it down.
Let your partner kiss you back and move with them as long as you’re comfortable with what they are doing.

Listen for clues that tell how much your partner is enjoying a particular maneuver. If you hear a sigh or moan, or they begin kissing you back with increased intensity, you're on the right track.

, Good French kissing, like good kissing of any kind, requires practice. You will get better as you do it more. In addition, the more practice you have with one person, the more comfortable you will feel kissing them and developing a style that suits both of you. Just because you may not have had a stellar first kiss doesn't mean that you and your kissing partner are romantically doomed; have patience and keep kissing slowly and gently until you fall into a rhythm that works for you.









Don't take yourselves too seriously, either. If you tried something that just plain failed, it's okay to laugh, to lightly apologize, and to try again. If you act devastated after a disappointing kiss, you'll only be making things weird for your partner, and there's no need for that.
Most first kisses, like most first attempts at love-making, aren't anything to write home about. Part of the fun is getting better at it — together.

, If you really like the way your partner kisses you, let them know. If you don't like something, also let your partner know that, but approach it delicately and compliment them at the same time on something they did that you liked. If your partner is being honest and open with you, try not to overreact or get hurt, or this may make your partner feel hesitant to communicate with you in the future.


Even if the kiss goes all wrong, it can still be an intimate affair if you can both laugh about it together! The important thing is that you're both honest about how you're feeling and what you want to do to improve.
You should also communicate by telling your partner how attractive they look, and how much you like them. Make it clear how happy you are to be with the person you're with, and the French kissing will come all the more naturally.

Time yourself.,
Prime the bottle.,
Determine your dose.,
Locate your frenulum.,
Apply 1-3 sprays.,
Wait ten minutes.,
Observe your progress during sex.,
Adjust the dose.",How to Use Promescent1," You will need to apply Promescent at least ten minutes before you engage in sexual intercourse. The numbing effects will last for up to an hour. Applying Promescent hours or seconds before you have sex will not work.;
, If you are using the standard metered-dose bottle, you will need to prepare it. Remove the small plastic piece over the nozzle. Unlock the child-resistant cap. Turn the bottle sideways and shake for ten seconds. Right the bottle and slowly press the spray pump. Do this up to twenty times, waiting about two seconds between pumps. When the formula releases, stop.

, For your first time, you might want to start with one or two sprays. The directions suggest three sprays for a first try, but many users find this numbs them too much. It is unsafe to use more than 10 sprays per dose.Each spray releases 10 mg of desensitizing lidocaine.

, Your frenulum is likely the most sensitive spot on your penis. It is the small ridge of tissue under the head of your penis, on the underside of your penis.

, Spray Promescent directly onto your penis, or spray onto the tips of your fingers and rub the formula onto your penis. Repeat up to three times using the same method. While the recommended dosage is three, many users find one or two sprays are all they need. Apply to the frenulum, or other spots you consider sensitive.


Make sure to rub in after each spray.
Wash your hands immediately afterward. Traces of Promescent on your hands could put you or your partner at risk of eye injury., Spend ten minutes without touching or washing your genitals. Your skin will absorb the Promescent in this time. Waiting for this absorption to take place will allow you to maintain good sensation. It also minimizes any transfer of the anesthetic to your partner.After ten minutes have passed, wash your genitals with soap and water. Trace amounts may cause numbness in your partner if you don't wash.
Don't be afraid of washing. The active ingredients will all have been absorbed after ten minutes.
Soaking your genitals will cause the Promescent to leach out, however. Do not take a bath after applying Promescent. Instead, wipe yourself clean with a wet washcloth.
Once the Promescent is absorbed and the genitals are washed, products such as condoms or lubricant are safe to use.

, Most users experience 2-3 times longer intercourse the first time they use Promescent. Some users report improved results after three uses of the product. During your first use, notice if you feel too numb or not numb enough. Ask your partner if it made him or her feel numb at all.


Re-apply if you wish. If you feel effects are not strong enough, or have worn off, you can repeat your application. Do not use more than 10 sprays in total.
If you used ten sprays for your first round of intercourse, do not re-apply.
If you use more than ten sprays of Promescent, you may experience numbness, loss of erection, and irritation.
In cases of overuse, wash your penis with soap and water immediately. Visit a doctor if symptoms persist.

, Depending on how your first experience went, you may wish to spray more, less, or on different parts of your penis. If the numb frenulum didn't work for you, try spraying along the shaft, or on the glans. Repeat use will help you determine the right dose and the right method of application for you.

, Disrespecting guys is never a good thing and vice versa to girls too. Lying AND disrespecting is always a hurtful thing.

, Sometimes your boyfriend might have bad days or is moody too because we might have a bunch of things on our mind and can't act like it all the time.... even though we don't mean to.

, Trust my word on this, guys sometimes wants and needs some alone time to spend with their guy friends to do some male bonding at the bar or something.So don't get worried if your boyfriend ditches you for his mates. Everyone needs a bit of space that's all.

, It doesn't always have to be the other way around. Don't be a material girl who always wants gifts and such and never gives in return.

, If some woman ever tries to hit on your boyfriend, do not always assume it was him who made the first move, as it might have been the woman who made it first. And, don't just be quick to accuse anyone. Have trust that's he's just talking to a friend that's a girl. It might not always be true but it's worth thinking this to save yourself the jealousy.

, It's perfectly natural for guys to accidentally started checking out other girls besides yourself! Girls, when you were with your boyfriend, don't say that you never did the same thing with other guys too! It depends on both of your comfort levels, whether or not its ""natural"". If you're not comfortable with it, talk about it with your partner.

, You know how good it feels to be told you look good today by your boyfriend, so return the favor every once in a while. If he dressed up for one of your nicer dates, then let him know he did a good job.

When you begin to feel closer to a very good friend, don't jump into it.,
If he/she doesn't seem to want to advance the relationship beyond ""friends,"" don't assume he/she was ""leading you on."",
If you do end up dating, that's all I can tell you.","How to Start a Strong ""Dating"" Relationship"," ""True love"" rarely comes from a woman you pick up at a bar (or a guy who picks you up at a bar). It may happen, too, but the chances are very slim. The longest-lasting ""dating"" relationships tend to be those that begin as strong ""friend"" relationships and eventually become more intimate. Perhaps the most difficult rule to believe is that love is not something you run around looking for.;
, Make sure he/she is sharing the feeling to a certain degree (It does not matter if you are a man or a woman; if you are making advances on a good friend who does not want to become ""involved"" with you, you will not begin dating, but will instead lose a friend.), and that you both have the same idea. Go slowly, and don't try to force yourselves into a relationship. This will usually be a fairly reliable way to annoy the potential girl/boyfriend. I won't say there are specific universal signs, but you will know when he/she is comfortable with holding hands, putting your arm around him/her, kissing him/her, etc. If they are nudging their faces up into yours, they are probably asking to be kissed, for example. There is no formula to apply here, though. A kiss on the cheek could mean that someone has committed him/herself to you, whereas with some, a kiss on the cheek is nothing more than saying ""hello"" or ""goodbye"" to an acquaintance.

, You may have seen his/her friendly remarks as potential come-ons because you wanted them to be. Just remember this: You can remain friends with him/her, without dating or thinking romantically of one another.

, This isn't a how-to for sex tips or anything other than building a healthy romantic relationship.

This will set you up for more successful romance. A good place to start is by making an impression on her by changing how you present yourself. Turn up the sexy and you'll start seducing her before you know it.


Dress to kill. Forget the sweatpants or jeans and a tee shirt: you want to show her that tonight is going to be different. Put on a pair of nice slacks and a dress shirt. Be sure they match (try a dark purple top with black pants or a navy blue top and brown pants). Get someone to help you make sure your hair looks nice too. If it's a really special date night, you might even want to go to a salon to have it styled. Your girlfriend will think that you stepped right out of a magazine.
Smell amazing. Girls are very sensitive to smells. A really good smell might not guarantee you success but a bad smell will almost definitely count against you. Use a light body spray or scented deodorant to get yourself smelling good.;
, Do something outside of the norm for how you usually act around her. This, much like a change in clothing, tells her that things are going to be different tonight. This can help grab her attention and set the stage for romance.


If you're usually very scripted in how you talk and interact with her, break the script. Instead of sounding all cool and collected, let your softer, hidden side shine through.
Another example is if you're usually very shy around her. Tonight, take charge in your interactions. She'll be very turned on.

, Touch plays a huge role in romance for women (as it does for men). If you're too quick to rush into the actual act of sex, your girlfriend can be turned off and feel overwhelmed. Use touch to set the stage and start warming her to the idea of romance.


Touch the back of her neck, caress her shoulders, play with her hair, stroke her collar bone; all of these actions can fundamentally shift how she's thinking in the moment.

, What you have to understand about women is that their sex drive tends to work very differently from a man's. Women tend to have their sex drive tank when they're stressed, sad, tired, or sick feeling in any way. If she's suffering from one of those bad moods, it just might not be possible to get her feeling in the mood and trying will only upset her more.


Timing is also important if it's her first time having sex or her first time having sex with you. If she's not ready for that step in a relationship, you shouldn't push her. Discuss the subject with her, tell her what you want, and see how she feels. Just make sure that she understands that you'll still have feelings for her, even if she isn't ready yet.

, Women are often uncomfortable having a close physical relationship with someone that they don't feel cares about them. A good way to show your girlfriend that you're serious in your commitment to her is to do something really, profoundly nice for her. You can certainly start with the usual flowers and chocolates but if you have the chance to do something with a bit more impact on her life, take that chance.


For example, let's say that she's having a hard time getting to work or school ever since her car broke down. Call up a buddy of yours who works on cars and find a way to trade for the use of his skills. Getting your girl back on the road will take a huge amount of stress off of her.
Of course, just because you do something nice does not mean she's obligated to have sex with you and you shouldn't use it as a way to pressure her into a more physical situation. Instead, this should be used to show her that you are a good partner, devoted to and honestly invested in her happiness.

, A romantic gesture is something nice for her that also declares your romantic interest. This will be very important as it shows that you think of her as more than just a friend. Girls will often worry that you don't find them sexy or attractive if you don't get romantic every now and again, which will turn them off of the idea of a physical relationship. Make a romantic gesture and she'll soften right up.


For example, you can turn the tables and make something for her for once. You've probably received a handmade scarf or something like that. Now it's her turn. A good go-to option is to make her something using origami. This looks really impressive but isn't that hard as long as you're patient. See our pages on origami for ideas and instructions.

, Another way to set the scene for romance is to compliment her. However, complimenting well doesn't come naturally to everyone. Sometimes we say things that we think are nice and we mean well, but it's easy to be insulting without meaning it. Pay attention to how you compliment and try to compliment her in a good way.


For example, you want to avoid compliments like ""you look really nice today"" because it implies that she does not normally look nice. Another one to avoid is ""that dress makes you look so thin"" because it implies that she normally looks fat.
While it's better to tailor compliments to the woman in question, a good go-to compliment would be something like ""I feel like I could talk to you forever"" or ""I feel like I can just be myself around you"".

, Who feels like being seduced when they're surrounded by dirty laundry and dishes? Romance is also harder if you're just going straight into it after a totally unromantic part of your day, like a stressful day at school or work. Help your girlfriend switch gears into a more romantic mindset so that she's ready to be seduced.


For example, you can set a romantic mood by putting together a romantic environment. Clean up, light some incense, and set out some flowers and candles. It doesn't take much work but it can really impress your girlfriend.

, Some studies have found that women have a more difficult time feeling physical pleasure when they're too cold.If you want to help ensure your own success, try turning up the heat in your room just a little higher than you'd normally set it.

, Start the serious seduction process by giving her a great massage. If you don't know how, don't worry: we've got your back. Go slow and don't cut it off after just a few minutes. You want to get her feeling nice and relaxed, like a big puddle of butter.


Use a bottle of lavender or regular baby oil (or an oil based lotion) to give the massage. This will stop you from irritating her skin and will also help your hands glide across her skin in a more soothing and sexy manner.
Pro Tip: prepare the oil by heating it up in a bowl of warm water just a few minutes before giving her the rub down.

, You probably know how to kiss. If you don't, you'll need to go back to the basics before you can really seduce her. However, even if you feel like a pro, you might want to consider trying to step up your game.


Experiment with kissing her stomach and the sides of her rib cage. This is a very sensitive area.
You can play a game where you kiss every one of her freckles, counting them and going in ever more risque directions as you go.
Another good spot is just at the corners of her mouth, which will be very sensitive and drive her crazy. She'll want to kiss your mouth but don't let her, instead kissing everywhere else until you make her beg you to kiss her on the lips.

, Guys tend to think that they should never talk dirty to a woman or that doing so might be disrespectful. However, there is a time and a place and for some women, this can be a huge turn on. Once you're in a sexy situation, try telling her exactly what you want to do to her. Tell her how you want to make her feel. Say these things in a low, husky voice. Whisper them into her ear. She'll find it irresistible because it's flattering for her to know how much you want her right now.


Say something like, ""You're so hot right now. I just want to tease you until you begging for me...""

, Once you've set the stage for the activity you want, you'll need to start stimulating her body so that she's ready for that kind of interaction. If you go too fast into the really physical stuff, you'll quickly turn her off. Stimulate her erogenous, or sexually sensitive, zones for a little while before going into actual sex.


Stimulating the back of her neck, her breasts, the inside of her thighs, ears and butt all can help get her in the mood. Pick a body part and them pick an action: kissing, licking, sucking, massaging, caressing...even using hot/cold stimulus like an ice cube. There are endless combinations.
Of course, if the stage has really been set, you can also stimulate more sensitive areas. If she's ready for it and you've established consent, you can rub against her clitoral area with your finger.

, If your relationship has been very vanilla and normal so far, introducing just the slightest hint of kink can really get your girlfriend interested in a physical relationship again. When sex feels old-hat and samey, pretty much everyone gets less interested in it; that's pretty normal. By making sex feel new and exciting again, you can seduce her right back into your arms.


For example, try blindfolding her and then play a game of slow-strip, kissing her progressively lower and lower down her body and then back up.The mix of sensations will feel amazing and she'll be ready for just about anything.

, Women take longer to warm up than men, so you'll want to go slow in all of your pre-game activities. The slower and more sensuous you are, the more ready she will be to rip your clothes off. A slow kiss here, a long lick down her neck there, and before you know it she'll be begging for more.


Your hands should not automatically go down her pants and under her shirt. Give yourself at least 20 minutes of other activities before even trying to take of her clothes.
Even the act itself will go better a lot of the time if you start off slow.

Talk to someone you trust about your relationship.,
Don’t play games.",How to Speed Up a Relationship1," Take the time to understand what you’re looking for in a date. Are you ready for a long-term commitment? Or are you more interested in having a sexual partner without other strings attached? You won’t be able to communicate this message to your date unless you first know it yourself.Don’t get distracted by ideas about what a relationship should look like, or what amount of time it should take a relationship to develop.
Remember that every relationship is different. This relationship might be best at a different speed than relationships you’ve had in the past.;
, If you’re clear about what you’re ready for in a relationship, it’s best to share this with him up front. Tell him if you’re ready for a long-term, committed relationship.On the other hand, it’s not necessary to scare him away. If you’ve only been on 3 dates and you’re feeling certain that this person is “the one” for you, you don’t have to share this information directly because it might cause him to feel pressured to respond in the same way.
If sexual intimacy doesn’t necessarily mean commitment to you, tell him this. He might be reluctant to speed things up if he thinks you’re pressuring him into commitment.

, If it’s clear that the two of you want different things in a relationship, it’s a good idea to separate before you’re more attached. Sometimes speeding up a relationship means not putting off a break-up that could free you up for a better match.Being honest with yourself and each other will help you know what’s best for you.
Sometimes there’s great chemistry between you and your date, but the timing isn’t right.

, Don’t manipulate or push your date to proceed at a speed that’s too fast. Share your needs with your partner, but you shouldn’t feel like he’s judging you.Don’t take it personally if your date isn’t ready to speed things up. Sometimes you’re just meeting each other at the wrong time.
If you don’t feel like you can talk honestly with your date, this is a bad sign for the success of your relationship.

, If you’re feeling like you want this relationship to speed up, think about why this might be. Are you worried that he’ll leave if the relationship continues at the same rate? Do you think that increased commitment will bring security? Sometimes people feel the urge to speed things up when they’re uncomfortable about certain aspects of the relationship. Going too quickly in relationships can mean ignoring warning signs.
If this is the case, being honest about this is important.
Notice if you’ve had similar experiences in other relationships. If so, think about what this might teach you about yourself.

, If you’d like to speed up your relationship, it will help to talk with someone you trust, whether this is a friend, a parent, or a therapist. Talking about your frustration with someone other than your date will help you get perspective on the situation.Someone who’s known you a while will likely be able to offer some insight about the way you tend to be in relationship with others.
Spending time with people who care about you will help you feel more content in your life, and take away some pressure from the relationship.

, Pretending to be unavailable, not answering his texts, or acting like you’re not interested are strategies that might work in the movies, but they’re unlikely to work in real life. Delaying having sex with him because you’re angling for commitment is unhealthy, unless you also have strong convictions about premarital sex.Remember that you’re not trying to trick him into commitment. You’re hoping to encourage him in developing a strong, intimate relationship.
If things are going well, maybe they’re going at the right speed also. Allow your relationship to unfold at its own speed.

You should never take her for granted, but it isn’t always practical to perform big romantic gestures. Try to surprise your partner with small gestures every now and then to show her how you feel.Try something simple and unexpected like a putting a note on the fridge that says “I love you”, or slipping a note in her pocket that says “I can’t wait to see you tonight.”
Finding a note when you don’t expect it can create a very warm and loving feeling.
It shows that you are thinking of your partner despite all the pressures of everyday life.;
, Every relationship is different, but often the romance dips as your sex life becomes more routine and less exciting. Make the effort to try new things and talk to your partner about your sex life.Try not to be embarrassed, and be honest about your desires as well as paying attention to your partners. Keep things relaxed and fun, and don’t turn it into an inquisition.


Try to think of your sex life as a crucial part of your relationship, and a way for you to connect and get closer to your partner.
Make sure you have time set aside to be together, but don’t think of it as part of your routine like everything else., Once you are living with your partner you will probably be spending a lot of time in the house together, but this time won’t necessarily be very romantic or intimate. This is especially the case if you have kids running around. Making time to have a weekly date night enables you to have guaranteed time together where you can just be a couple and enjoy spending time together.You will find you start having the kind of conversations you used to have, and you will begin to learn new things about each other.
Being free from the interruptions of everyday life allows you to concentrate on each other.
Rekindling this intimate connection can translate to your sex life., Once you have started making more time to connect, with fewer interruptions from the outside world, you may find that you are more able to have deep and meaningful conversations. Talk about your fears, your ambitions, and your relationship. These conversations can bring you closer together and help you continue to discover new things about each other. Remember what sparked your romance in the first place and talk about it.While you may realise you don’t have the free time you used to have, you will remind each other of what brought you together.Talking about fun things you have done together in the past will reinforce the connection between you and your partner.
You can prompt these deeper conversation by asking each other questions. Research has suggested that certain questions can bring you and your partner closer together.
The questions to ask include: ""what do you feel most grateful for in life?"" and ""what is your most treasured memory?"", An important part of a strong relationship is having two people who understand each other’s needs and desires, emotional as well as sexual. You should concentrate on pleasing your partner and making her happy. In order to do this you will need to really communicate with each other and listen to what the other says.If you have a romantic idea, share it with your partner.Focus on being clear and specific and using ""I-statements."" This could be ""I'm really tired from work this week. Could you take you take care of the chores to help me out?""
Try to express a need without sounding judgmental. Don't say something like ""you should do the chores, I'm tired from work.""

, You should try to practice active listening in order to ensure that you are really hearing and understanding what your partner is saying. Active listening is listening with the intent to understand, not with the intent to reply.Give feedback to indicate that you are listening carefully and taking in what your partner is saying, such as just nodding or saying ""yes.""
Allow pauses and short periods of silence, but remain attentive and make it clear that you are listening., It's important to accentuate the positive aspects of your partner and your relationship to keep it strong and happy. Little irritations can build up over time, and can seem more central to your relationship than the more positive things, which you might take for granted. Try to combat this by focusing on the positives and restating them frequently.


Research suggests that a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative comments is connected to long-term marriage stability.
A ratio of 0.8:1 or lower, tends to predict divorce, so be sure that the positive outweighs the negative.Frequent compliments, no matter how small, can help each partner feel more loved.

, If you feel that you and your partner are growing more distant and are not communicating well, you should consider the different ways in which people express affection and love. There is a theory which argues that there are five main ""love languages."" Recognizing which of them your partner ""speaks"" can help you to communicate and understand each other better. The five ""love languages"" are:


Words of encouragement or affirmation.
Quality time spent together.
Gifts and tokens of affection.
Acts of service, or help with necessary tasks.
Physical touch, such as holding hands or having sex., Being physically intimate with somebody is not just about sex, but about touching and cuddling someone too. Touching someone or cuddling up next to them can make you feel safe and warm, but it can also make you feel happier and healthier. Research has shown that being physically close to someone results in your body releasing oxytocin, a molecule that can help you to feel more affectionate and trusting.Maintaining a relationship that has frequent physically contact, such as cuddling and holding hands, is also associated with more positive sexual relationship.
More general physical contact has been connected to increased overall relationship satisfaction."

Listen to other people moan.,
Don't feel pressured to moan.,
Avoid outright faking it.,
Moan softly during foreplay.,
Moan loudly when things get intense.,
Start by sighing softly.,
Breathe in and out, audibly.,
As your breathing intensifies, add some voice and tone to your breath.,
Add a few ""mmmmm""s. Use an inflection that makes it clear that you're enjoying it.,
Try it out the next time you're with a partner.,
Remember that there is no right or wrong way to moan.",How to Moan," A moan is a noise of passion that escapes you when you're overcome by pleasure or sensation – usually in a sensual context. It's a way of vocalizing how good you're feeling. However, not everyone is prone to ""being loud,"" and many people have a hard time making their sensual feelings public. With practice, confidence, and a supportive partner, you may learn to unlock your moan and make it feel more natural.;
, Watch videos or listen to audio clips of people pleasuring each other and making noise. Watch YouTube videos about how to moan.The best way to master your moan is to imitate others who do it well. If you hear someone make a noise that sounds sexy, wait until you're alone – then try to replicate that noise.

, Everyone responds to intense pleasure in their own way, and you don't need to force yourself to moan if it doesn't come naturally to you. Yes, some people are naturally very loud in bed – but the moans you hear in movies or pornography are intentionally stylized versions of reality. If someone truly enjoys your company, they shouldn't care whether or not you're a moaner.You may even find that your partner (however long-term or temporary) doesn't care for moans. Don't assume that everyone finds moans attractive just because there is a cultural fetish for the noises.

, When you moan, it should be a heightened expression of what you're already feeling. If you pretend to feel good when you don't, it may be obvious to your partner. Think about moments when you're enjoying what you're feeling, but you don't express it outwardly. Moaning is essentially an outward expression of that pleasure. It's a way of sharing it.


In some cases, you may feel that it's necessary to fake a moan. Maybe you want to make your partner feel appreciated even though you aren't really in the mood; maybe you just think that a person will find it hot if you turn up the volume. Practice beforehand, at a time when you are into it, so that your fake moans sound more authentic.

, Soft moans can be a great way to signal to your partner that you're into what's happening and you want it to continue. Let out a gasp or a low ""mmmm"" when your partner touches you in a way that feels good. Don't overdo it, or it might come off as fake.

, Moaning more heavily can take an intense moment to the next level. Let your moans last longer. Release your inhibitions, and don't be afraid to lose a bit of control. The more you get into it, the more authentic—and, likely, arousing to your partner—your sounds will be.


Be aware of the setting. If you need to be quiet for any reason, try not to let yourself get too into the act of moaning. Maybe the walls are thin, or you have a roommate, or your parents are sitting in the next room over. Save the loud moans for a time when you can really let loose.

, The simplest ""moan"" is just a gentle sigh of pleasure. You can let this noise out at any point that it seems appropriate. Sigh at the first touch, or during foreplay, or anytime that things slow down. In general, however, it's very much a ""getting things started"" noise.

, As the situation intensifies, let your breath quicken, and try to make it audible – as though you're exerting yourself. As things get hotter and heavier, you may find that your breathing swells to match the heat of the moment. Don't be afraid to let your breath get ragged and loose as you lose yourself in the feeling.

, Every time you breathe in, engage your vocal chords to make an ""uuunhh"" sound. If you're a female, consider letting your voice inflect higher than normal, and if you're a male, consider letting your voice inflect lower – but don't feel bound to any ""norm"", and feel free to moan in whichever way feels most natural.Alternately, engage your vocal chords when you breathe out. It may be easier to make the pitch of your moan sound deeper on the outward breath than on the intake. Either way, the muscles involved are essentially the same.

, Don't ""mmmm"" monotonously; use a sexy, seductive tone. Think of yourself like a cat purring from pleasure: you can tell that a cat is happy when it purrs, even though it's just rumbling in a certain tone.

, Real-world experience is the best way to build confidence and master your moan. Do it even if you feel self-conscious. The more you practice your moan, the more natural it will become – and the easier it will be.If you've been with someone for a while, you may want to start small. Use sighs, ""mmmmm""s, and low moans at first; don't jump straight into a fit of loud moaning that might take your partner aback.
If you find yourself with a new partner, you have no expectations to contend with. Consider trying to lose yourself in the moment and explore a new, uninhibited side of yourself.

, The important thing is that you're enjoying yourself with someone who is also enjoying him/herself. Let it be a natural thing; a thing of joy; a thing of beauty.

Love yourself.,
Practice self-care.,
Acknowledge that relationships can be hard.,
Try to refrain from judging.",How to Speed Up a Relationship2," If you’re miserable, chances are it’s going to be harder to find someone who wants to commit. Remember that a relationship won’t satisfy you unless you’re able to love yourself first.Putting energy into a new relationship must come from a place of self-confidence, not neediness.
If your relationship is built around neediness, it’s unlikely to be healthy in the long term.

, Being gentle with yourself is essential to staying healthy in a relationship. Make sure that you’re tending to your needs, both physical and mental. This means taking the time to exercise, meditate, relax, spending time with friends, doing activities that you enjoy.Don’t expect another person to meet all your needs.
Caring for yourself will have a wonderful effect on your well-being, which will benefit all your relationships.

, Accepting someone else’s differences, and admitting your own shortcomings, isn’t easy to do. This process of discovery can be painful, but sometimes the most difficult parts of relationships result in the most personal growth.You might find ways that you carry pain from past relationships is affecting your experience with this person.
It’s possible to waste a lot of energy resenting the fact that relationships can be hard. When you expect a relationship to be perfect, you’re setting yourself up for failure.

, Relationships set up the perfect breeding ground for judgmental thoughts, which lead to resentments. Judging your date for doing things you don’t like will lead to frustration - quickly. There are several kinds of judgment that can impact a relationship in its early stages.They are:


Criticizing: When you imply that your date is wrong for his reaction to an event or situation, and that you are right. This sets you up as a moral judge, the decider of what is right and wrong. It’s unhelpful, and doesn’t lead to greater intimacy.
Analyzing: When you try to assume that you know why your date is saying something, you’re engaging in the judgmental nature of analysis. For example, saying, “You’re just doing that to make me angry,” implies that you know what the appropriate action is. It’s a way of implying that you’re the healthy one in the relationship.
Praising: You might be surprised to see this listed as a judgment, but it is a way of blocking intimate relationships by selectively reinforcing only the behaviors that you prefer. In addition, praising someone too often erodes trust over time because it’s perceived as insincere.

Take time off together.,
Plan a big trip.,
Do something out of the ordinary.",How to Refresh Your Romance2," Sometimes the weight of everyday life is such that you and your partner need to get away from everything in order to have some real quality and intimate time together. Schedule some time when you can both be off work, and neither of you have any other commitments and just focus on each other.You don’t have to do anything especially out of ordinary, but just being together when you both know that there is nothing to drag either of you away can help.
Do simple but fun things together to help you feel closer.
Just turning your phones and spending the whole weekend in bed can refresh your romance.

, If it is possible, you should try to take a trip together to really get away from everything. Going somewhere neither of you have been before will enable you to create new shared experiences together. Taking a holiday can give you a chance to relax together and reinvigorate your relationship by exposing you to new things.You can connect all over again as you struggle to communicate in a foreign language, or try the mysterious local cocktails.
Even if you can’t afford to get away, take some time planning your dream trip together. This will give you something to look forward to and reaffirm that you want to experience it together., A holiday is a great way to have new experiences together that can refresh your relationship, but you can do smaller versions of this too. Try to do something together that neither of you have done before. It will take you out of your everyday lives and help you to reconnect. Talk through some ideas and then throw yourselves into it. You could, for example, take a class together.Learning new things together is a great way to help you feel more connected and have fun.
You could take a sports class, such as tennis or golf.
You could try an arts class, such as pottery or life drawing.

Ask their friends and family.,
Make a list of their favorite things.,
Factor in their personality.",How to Plan a Memorable Marriage Proposal1," Friends and family who have known your partner for a long time will likely have an idea if they have a dream proposal, and what it might include. For instance, your partner’s siblings may recall your partner talking about how wonderful it would be to receive a marriage proposal on a beach, at sunset. As an added bonus, informing other people about your intention to propose means that you can enlist their help with planning the occasion.


Friends and family can also inform you if your partner has expressed dislike of certain traditional proposals (e.g. on the big screen at a baseball game).
Ask a question like, ""Has Jane ever told you anything about what her ideal proposal would be?"";
, When planning your proposal, make a list of some of your partner’s favorite things and try to incorporate them into your plan. The event will be all the more memorable if your partner is surrounded by things they love while they are being proposed to. Some things to add to your list should include their favorite:


Flowers
Music
Food or dessert
Drink (alcoholic or otherwise)

, Take your partner's personality type into account before planning a proposal. If your partner is outgoing and adventurous, a grandiose, public proposal is an excellent idea. If they are shy or very private about things, plan a more intimate proposal that will be memorable for its sentimental value.Spend time reflecting on your partner's morals, values, beliefs, likes and dislikes and design the proposal based on these qualities. Make the proposal about honoring your partner and your relationship, not just the things that you like. You might think a proposal in front of thousands of people would be cool, but your partner might find it embarrassing.
For example, you might try writing a love letter to your shy partner that ends in a proposal. Either have them read it, or read it to them in a quiet, romantic setting. The letter will also make a perfect keepsake.
If your partner is adventurous and outgoing, try to make arrangements for a proposal on-stage at a big event, like a concert or sporting event.

Schedule sex.,
Make it a date night.,
Turn off the TV and other distractions.,
Find energy for sex.,
Go to bed earlier, with your partner.,
Remember there’s no “right amount” of sex.",How to Make Sex Important in a Relationship1," No, it’s not romantic. But sometimes life gets in the way, and you are too busy or tired to make time for it. While it might feel awkward at first, and not at all spontaneous, you may eventually find yourself looking forward to that time of reconnecting with your partner.Discuss how often you want to have sex and come to an agreement. Mark the dates in your calendars so you don’t forget.
Consider scheduling sex for a month or two to see if this is a strategy that works for you.;
, If you are having a hard time getting used to the idea of scheduling sex, consider that in the early days of your relationship, you likely inadvertently “scheduled” it. For example, when you first started dating, you may have known you would see your partner on Friday night. You may have anticipated that you would have sex that evening, which may have been exciting or arousing for both of you.Plan a fun evening out with your partner. Tease and flirt with each other to generate that “new date” excitement. Keep the excitement going until you can get to a private place to get it on.

, It’s easy to get sucked into binge-watching TV shows or getting lost in the internet in your free time, instead of spending that time connecting with your partner. Consider making a pact with your partner that you will spend a set amount of time each day or week just spending time together, without your phones or another screen present.


You may not wish to put pressure on yourselves to have sex; rather, this can just be a time to connect and hang out with each other. If sex happens, great! But even if it doesn’t, you are laying the groundwork for further intimacy down the road.
You could ask your partner, “Do you just want to lay in bed and relax for a little bit? I could rub your back, or we could just cuddle.”

, Many people are exhausted at the end of the day, when they finally reconnect with their partner. If you want to make sex a priority in your relationship, however, don’t your fatigue as an excuse. Get creative and find some ways to work it into your day.If the two of you are morning people, wake up a little earlier in the morning.
Find creative ways to have sex during the day, like in the shower while getting ready for work, or meeting on your lunch breaks for a quickie.
Wake yourself up in the evening with some exercise. You’ll feel more alert and energized.

, If you are going to bed at different times, it is likely going to be difficult for you to make time for sex in the evenings, as one of you may already be asleep. Try going to bed at the same time as your partner and see what happens.While the first few nights you may actually fall asleep without sex, as your body adjusts to the extra sleep and new schedule, you may find yourself reaching for your partner before falling asleep.

, We live in a culture saturated by sex. You may feel pressure to have more sex in your relationship because of what you are seeing in the media.The right amount of sex for you and your partner is what you and your partner decide works for you, not what some magazine says!


It’s okay if you don’t want to have sex twice a week and would rather have it twice a month. Maybe you’re not interested in sex at all. As long as you and your partner are on the same page about your sex life together, your libido is not a problem!"

Prepare for conversation on the first date.,
Practice good listening skills.,
Move towards deeper conversations on the next few dates.",How to Start a Conversation With Your Boyfriend1," First dates can be awkward, even if you have an established friendship beforehand. Have a vague idea about what subjects to discuss going into the date to save yourself from awkward silence.


On a first date, try to listen more than you talk. You don't want to dominate the conversation. Many people overcompensate by talking too much when nervous in order to avoid conversation lulls. Instead of verbally dumping when silence hits, try asking a question. Even something simple (""How was your day?"") can be a good way to keep conversation moving.If you're just getting to know someone, you need to allow intimacy to happen at its own rate. Don't ask too many personal, sensitive questions during the first date. This can cause someone to become defensive and feel uncomfortable. Do not shy away from bringing up meaningful topics, but try not to pry too much into someone's personal life.Make a mental list of first date questions to pose if the conversation lulls. What is your family like? Do you like your job? What do you do in your free time? What are your friends like? What kind of vacations do you take? These are all great questions that can stimulate steady conversation on a first date.;
, People who are the most interesting are the ones who are the most interested. You need to use good listening skills to convey genuine curiosity about what your boyfriend is saying.


Maintain eye contact. Don't scan the room or look at your phone or computer screen. This conveys a sense of distraction. Look at your boyfriend when he talks and give cues, such as smiling and nodding when appropriate, that you are engaged in the conversation.Listen without judgment. While you might be tempted to evaluate character during the early stages of a relationship, try to leave judgment behind at first. Remember your partner is using language to convey his feelings and the only way to understand those feelings is to listen.Create a picture of what is being said. While your boyfriend talks, use images in your head to create a mental picture of what is being said. This can be a literal pictures of a series of abstracts. Images help us remember, which allows us to come off as a good listener.Do not plan what you're going to say while your boyfriend is talking. If you're mentally rehearsing your own contributions, this infringes on your ability to pay attention.When you ask questions, wait for a pause in conversation. Ask questions to clarify what the speaker is saying., As you continue seeing your boyfriend, it's okay to move the conversation forward into more serious territory. While you don't want to discuss your romantic future in a serious sense for awhile, it's okay to talk about more intimate issues.


Keeping it casual does nothing to form serious bonds, and it could also make you look less appealing as a partner. A study on dating and intimacy conducted by the University of Arizona found that those who engaged in small talk past the first date were less compelling to their partners.While you don't want to reveal intimate secrets right away, talking about serious, if somewhat impersonal topics, can be a good way to transition into more serious territory. Bring up current events, anything you've read recently, and pop culture trends. Don't be afraid to share thoughts or opinions you feel passionately about as this can lead to greater intimacy down the road.Open ended questions. Stuff like ""What's your favorite color?"" warrants no explanation but a broader question about taste (i.e., ""What are you passionate about?"") leaves room for lengthy conversation.Intimacy is important. Human beings are social animals who also strive to give meaning to their experience. These factors drive our desire for intimacy. Accepting you need closeness, and reaching for it, is important to move any conversation forward."

Save money.,
Make the most of your budget.,
Customize the ring.,
Present the ring creatively.",How to Plan a Memorable Marriage Proposal2," Save up for an engagement ring well in advance so that you can buy it without taking a bit hit financially. Open a dedicated saving account without an ATM card, so that you won't feel tempted to spend any of the money in it. You can also consider saving money in small ways over a period of two to three months by:Selling unwanted items on websites like Craiglist or Ebay
Cutting back on unnecessary expenses (e.g. dining out)
Buying generic products whenever possible
Optimizing your cell phone plan to prevent monthly overpaying

, There are many small ways to cut down the cost of an engagement ring. These options can be discussed with jewelers when you are shopping for the ring. Ask about:Emerald cut stones, which cover a larger surface of a ring than other stones
A halo setting, a circle of small stones around a center stone, which makes the middle stone look larger
Pave diamonds, tiny diamonds that add extra sparkle to the setting or band of an engagement ring for less

, Choosing a ring that your partner will love means considering their tastes before deciding on anything. If they haven't already told you about what they'd like their engagement ring to look like, take clues from elsewhere, and consider having it engraved to make the gesture extra special. Think about the jewelry that they already own and wear frequently, and note if it is:


Bold or understated
Yellow gold, white gold, platinum, or silver (and choose a metal that will match)
More circular or square in shape (e.g. necklace charms or earrings)

, Presenting an engagement ring to your partner in a surprising, creative way can make your proposal especially memorable. Be unsuspecting by hiding the ring in a box much larger than the ring box, or in a bottle of champagne. Alternatively, be romantically obvious by getting down on one knee, holding up the ring box, and opening it in front of your partner.

Make sure that the memory is significant enough that your partner will recognize it instantly.Propose at the place that you first fell in love with your partner (e.g. the cafe where you both worked at the time).
Make a scrapbook of your best photographs and memories together and write your proposal out on the last page.
Set up a screening of the first movie you saw together (e.g. in your living room, or on a projector in your backyard) and propose during the movie.
Try writing a simple proposal speech that highlights the things you love about your partner and the special, private details that make your relationship unique. Include every quality about them that you love, and why you want them to be your spouse.

, If one of your partner’s favorite movies or television shows features a romantic wedding proposal, consider replicating it. What they love about a movie is a good indication of what they would appreciate in real life. Reproduce the venue, props, and set-up, and don’t worry about pulling it off flawlessly- a proposal with a comedic tinge will be just as memorable and charming.For instance, try replicating the proposal in Love Actually for a grandiose effect. Have a large group of friends or family follow you (as the villagers trail Colin Firth’s character in the film) and make a heartfelt speech to your partner in broken Portuguese to ask for their hand in marriage. If your partner is a fan of the film, this will be funny, romantic, and memorable.

, If you and your partner have a trip planned together, make the most of the opportunity to propose while you are away. Your proposal can essentially piggyback on the excitement of travel, and is bound to be something out of the ordinary and truly memorable (e.g. proposing in front of the Bellagio fountain in Las Vegas, Nevada). There is also the added bonus of popping the question at a grandiose tourist spot that you and your partner would be visiting anyway, giving your proposal the element of surprise while maintaining the magic of the setting (e.g. the Eiffel tower in Paris or the Grand Canyon in Arizona).When preparing for your trip, budget extra money for supper at a nice restaurant, or a bottle of champagne to celebrate your new engagement.

, Share the joy of your proposal by getting friends and family involved. Either pop the question at a family dinner or event, or invite friends and family to the venue where you plan to propose. For the best of both worlds, opt to propose one-on-one and then bring out everyone as a surprise- this will give you two an intimate moment and allow for everyone to share in your happiness right after.Approach family and friends by saying something like, ""I am proposing to Tim, and I would love it if you could be a part of the event.""

, If you have the cash and are certain your partner would love something big and less intimate, hire a company that will help you customize and pull off an elaborate proposal that will create a huge impact. Proposal packages range greatly in price depending on what your wishes are — for example, The Heart Bandits, a romantic event planning company in the U.S., has proposal packages for between $300 to $2,500.Alternatively, Brilliant Event Planning, a company with offices in New York City and Boston, offers services that start at $500 and has charged up to $50,000 for customized proposals.Look online for a local event planning company that could help you with a spectacular proposal involving:


A flash mob
A musical serenade
A romantic gondola ride
A limousine tour
A carriage ride through the park

Talk about it.,
Show your partner what you like.,
Be open to constructive criticism.,
Understand consent.",How to Make Sex Important in a Relationship2," Communicate with your partner about your desires, your turn-offs, and how you are feeling. Revisit this conversation often, as feelings, preferences, and life can change. Remember that couples frequently fight about sex, so it is important to keep communication open and clear to avoid resentment and frustration building up.You may feel uncomfortable or vulnerable having a conversation with your partner about your sexuality, but try anyway. You could say, “Even though I have sex with you, I still feel kind of weird talking about having sex with you. But I want to talk with you about our sex life as a couple and how we can make it better.”
Tell your partner what you like about your sex life and what turns you on. Talk about what you would like to change, or what puts you in the mood. You could say, “I really like it when we have sex in the shower and I would like to do that more often. I like it when we use toys. I wish we could have sex at least twice a week.” Ask your partner what they like or would change about your sex life.

, You both may find it very sexy to show your partner what you enjoy. Demonstrate how you masturbate to your partner, or place your partner’s hands on your body and show them what to do.If you or your partner don’t really know what you enjoy, experiment on yourselves or on each other. Masturbation is an important component of your sexual knowledge and health.

, Whether you are discussing sex or actually in the middle of it, create an environment where you are both open to acknowledging when one of you isn’t enjoying something. Sex makes us vulnerable, so it can be hard to handle criticism, but being too sensitive to receive it will create tension with your partner.


If your partner says, “I don’t really like it when you touch me like that,” say, “I’m sorry. Can you show me what you like?”
Don’t take it personally. Even after many years, you will still have things to learn about each other.

, Discuss sexual consent with your partner. For an open, healthy sexual relationship, both of you need to understand what consent means for each other, and agree that consent can be withdrawn at any time.For example, say you and your partner decide to have sex and you’re getting ready with some foreplay. All of the sudden, your partner says, “You know what, I don’t think I’m in the mood tonight.” Immediately stop what you are doing and say, “Okay.” See if they want to talk about it. Do not argue with them or try to coerce them into continuing.
It is still important to have consent even if you have been sexual partners for many years. Feelings and preferences aren’t constant, and it is important not to assume a sexual act is okay, even if you have been doing it for years. Always ask, “Is it okay if I do this?” or “Do you want me to do this?” and make sure your partner verbally agrees."
"
Physically connect with your partner.,
Know what sets the mood.,
Create a romantic atmosphere.,
Take care of chores for each other.,
Go on a weekly date.,
Be ready with the necessary contraception.",How to Make Sex Important in a Relationship3," The two of you may be kept apart by jobs and other responsibilities for a large portion of the day. When you are together, make it a point to be be in close physical contact with the other person. Kiss, hug, and caress your partner.


Even if you don’t end up having sex, physical touch will help generate more intimacy between the two of you. It also helps you relax and improves your physical and emotional health.Consider setting time aside each day for the two of you to snuggle, hug, or just sit close with each other.

, Know your partner’s turn-ons, and yours, too. Keep in mind these turn-ons may not necessarily be physical or sexual in nature. See if you can find a pattern in your lives together when you are both more amorous, and do your best to replicate those times!


Talk to your partner about when they most want to have sex. They might say, “After a romantic date,” or “When we have a lot of fun together.” Figure out ways to create these moods for your partner. You may want to take them to a new restaurant or to play mini-golf, for example.
If your partner loves the thrill of anticipation, consider incorporating some flirtatious, teasing behaviors into your day. You could send racy texts, whisper things you want to do with them into their ear, or start making out with them only to stop and say, “More later.”, Consider what you and your partner like to create a romantic, intimate mood. While you might not be able to have a heart made of rose petals on the bed every time, you can still make your environment romantic and special.


Consider soft lighting, like candles or low ambient light. Overhead is probably too harsh.Invest in some nice, soft bedding you both enjoy spending time in.
Play music that helps set the mood: R&B, jazz, or soft rock may be good choices, but it depends on your taste.
At the very least, clean up your bedroom and free it of distractions. Turn off the TV and pick up clothes off the floor. Straightening up the rest of your living space, if you can, would also be a plus.

, While this doesn’t sound romantic, studies have shown how helping your partner with chores around the house can actually put them in the mood for sex, because they are less stressed with the household responsibilities hanging over their heads. Find out what chores your partner would like help with and do them without prompting.Consider doing the dishes, cleaning the bathroom, or putting the children to bed so your partner can relax.
Do not hold it over your partner’s head that you helped out, so you expect sex in return. That creates more pressure on your partner and may kill the mood.

, If the two of you have busy lives, you may struggle to find the time to reconnect. If you are not making time for each other outside of the bedroom, it will be difficult to make time inside the bedroom. A standing weekly date will help you both make your relationship a priority, which will enhance your sex life.Your date doesn’t have to be anything big. It may be as simple as going for a long walk. The important thing is that you are spending time together, reconnecting as a couple.
Get a babysitter. If you have kids, make sure you arrange a babysitter. It may be helpful for one partner to schedule the babysitter, while the other partner finds the date night activity., If you are using contraception, have it ready to go or already be using it (if you are female in a heterosexual relationship and using the birth control pill, for example). That way you can relax and enjoy sex when the mood strikes, rather than having to worry about running to the pharmacy, or risking an unintended pregnancy or an STI (sexually transmitted infection).


Remember that condoms are widely available, inexpensive, and the best prevention for both pregnancy and STIs when used correctly.Talk to your family doctor or visit a family planning clinic to learn more about contraception options.

Understand why avoidance does not work.,
Phrase positive and negative comments directly.,
Prepare your phrasing carefully.,
Use ""I""-statements.,
Set goals together.,
Maintain optimism, even after a fight.",How to Start a Conversation With Your Boyfriend2," A cool off period after you have a major disagreement is fine, but letting things stew too long can result in a major blow up down the road. It's important to understand why difficult conversation are necessary as this motivates us to avoid putting them off.


Underlying disputes, even small ones, do not get resolved when things are put on pause. Small things that seem trivial can resurface on a bad day, leading to overreactions in regards to seemingly easily resolved conflicts. Both parties leave harboring feelings of hostility.Small-scale issues become large-scale issues when they're not discussed. Oftentimes, other unresolved issues get dragged into a debate that could have been easily smoothed over the first time a disagreement occurred. These types of conflicts are far harder to get around., Being indirect about an issue can easily fuel misunderstandings. Conversations about conflicts should be as direct as possible.


Oftentimes, we use ""but"" sentences to obscure what's really bothering us. For example, ""I love when we see movies together, but I wish we weren't always running late."" The happiness your boyfriend felt during the first part of the sentence is dampened when he hears the second part. This means he's going into the conversation with disappointment, which can fuel stress and hostility.Comments, both positive and negative, should be phrased in a direct manner. Try to end on good news rather than bad news. For example, ""I wish we didn't miss the first 15 minutes of the film, but I had a good time tonight."" This way, the good news is heard without the subsequent letdown. The negative news is addressed in a way that does not feel passive or snuck in, making your boyfriend more willing to change and understand., Do not simply launch into an argument when something's bothering you. If an issue's been on your mind for awhile, plan how you're going to address the issue beforehand. Oftentimes, people get nervous or angry during confrontation. This can result in you not expressing yourself correctly.


Announce the conversation topic, making clear what you want to discuss and why. Speak in terms of feelings, which are subjective, rather than facts. ""I want to talk about how I sometimes feel like you don't listen to me"" is better than ""I want to talk about how you don't listen to me."" This way, your partner doesn't feel like you're imposing an objective truth on the situation. He might resent this, especially if he sees things differently., Personal opinions can sound like facts if you phrase them without prefacing you're speaking about your feelings. ""I""-statements help us take responsibility for how we feel without pushing blame onto external forces or other people. When having disagreements, use ""I""-statements to curb judgment while also being upfront about what you're experiencing emotionally. ""I""-statements have three parts.


The first part is the emotion. Begin with, ""I feel..."" and immediately follow up with an emotion (e.g., ""I feel happy..."" ""I feel sad..."" ""I feel uncomfortable...""). State the emotional immediately without adding anything else. Statements like ""I feel like"", ""You make me feel,"" and ""It makes me feel"" can trivialize your feelings or attribute them to external forces.The second part is behavior. Follow with the behavior that contributes to your feeling. Simply state the behavior that leads to you feeling a certain way, avoiding criticism, judgment, or any other external moralizing.The last part is the why. Explain why you feel a certain emotion when another person engaged in a particular behavior.""I""-statements can be beneficial to communication because they help avoid blame, express emotions in an accurate manner that minimizes hostility, and can reduce negative feelings like guilt and remorse for the other person.Waiting until you've had time to think is key. Do not say things you don't mean in the heat of the moment. Waiting allows you to articulate your thoughts in a kind, patient manner.Plan around time. If you know the conversation will take a few hours, don't start it at 11PM when you both need to work in the morning. Aim to talk during a free afternoon so the conversation isn't strained by an externally enforced timeline., Difficult conversations should lead to some kind of resolution. In other words, you need to leave the conversation with specific goals on how to improve the issue.


Do not enter the discussion with a predetermined outlook. The goals should be shared and you should decide on them together during the course of the conversation.Aim for goals that preserve everyone's emotional well-being and allow you and your boyfriend to feel safe and comfortable in the relationship., The adage ""Never go to bed angry"" exists for a reason. You should not leave a fight or discussion harboring resentment. Positivity is key for good communication and can aid future conversations.


Feelings things are hopeless creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you decide you've ""lost"" a fight or that the relationship is going downhill, you'll end up interpreting everything you partner says with a tone of pessimism of hostility.Try to stay positive and operate under the assumption your boyfriend cares about you and wants to keep the relationship strong. This way, you'll be healthier, happier, and easier to talk to overall."
"
Make time every day to have a conversation.,
Discuss how to handle conflict.,
Be able to discuss sex openly.,
Discuss relationship expectations.",How to Start a Conversation With Your Boyfriend3," This doesn't have to be a serious conversation, but you should take time to talk to your boyfriend each day. You can schedule a regular thing, like nightly walks, or just have some time away from the TV each night.


To some degree this should come naturally. If you are having trouble conversing, try going on a quiet date, like dinner or coffee, where your only option is to talk.
Simply asking your boyfriend ""How was your day?"" is a great way to open conversation. This is an open ended question that allows him to pick and choose the most interesting bits of his day to share with you.
You can plan your talking time around your schedules. If early evenings are always bad, try to talk in the mornings or afternoons.

, Conflict is an inevitable part of any relationship. In order to address conflict correctly, you need to identify how you both handle conflict and figure out ways to deal with disagreements that are mutually beneficial.


People have different styles of conflict resolution. Some people avoid or deny conflict, others become hostile and blame the other person, and some people look at conflict as a competition and try to manipulate the situation to win. Try to be conscious of how you handle conflict. Identifying your method is the first step to adjusting it.You need to view conflict as a shared issue. In a relationship, there is rarely only one party who is in the right. Do not try to get your way every time or minimize and deny what your boyfriend is feeling. Conversely, always giving in to satisfy another person's needs is also damaging. You'll end up harboring feelings of resentment.Your attitude helps in conflict resolution. Go in with the right frame of mind, which means you're approaching the conflict as an issue between two equals. Be respectful when expressing your own feelings and receptive to what your boyfriend is feeling. You both need to make compromises to assure the other party feels secure.Resolving conflict is a process. Start by identifying the issue, discussing several possible solutions, and then mutually deciding which solution, or combination of solutions, is the most viable. Implement the solution and follow up with discussion in a week or two. Evaluate how the solution is working and how you're both feeling about the issue., Sex is a big part of any intimate relationship. Many relationships end due to sexual incompatibility. As you start moving into physical intimacy, be prepared to openly talk about sex.


Many couples feels hesitant to discuss sex, especially if there are issues in regards to their sex life. Feelings of shame and discomfort can halt conversation, but communication is important to a healthy relationship and sex life. Establishing dialogue is important.Find the right time to talk. During sex, people often discuss what feels good in the moment. If you want to have a more detailed conversation about needs and wants, wait until you're not neutral grounds.Talk about any changes in your body, such as hormonal changes or certain medications curbing sexual desire. If your boyfriend does not know what's going on with you, he may interpret changes as a lack of interest. Discuss how to get around such issues together as a couple.Be honest. As you begin becoming intimate with another person, be honest about your wants and needs. Sexual problems become more difficult the longer they go on, so anything that's unsatisfying or makes you uncomfortable should be discussed right away., Every romantic relationship comes with a series of expectations, but there are no universal truths in regards to romance. To maintain healthy communication throughout a relationship, be upfront about your expectations.


Expectations change when we move past the preliminary dating phase. Expectations in terms of time spent together, daily contact, and sex adjust with time. Respecting and accepting change is healthy and normal, and talking about your needs as they arise, is important to maintaining a relationship.Your boyfriend cannot know what you want and need unless you tell him. If you feel uncomfortable without daily communication, even just something small like a text message, tell him this. Your boyfriend might also have different expectations, wants, and needs than you. When you talk to him, try to empathize and respect where he is coming from if disagreements or mismatched expectations arise.Space is another factor in a relationship that needs to be discussed. Your and your boyfriend both need time apart with friends and time to engage in your own personal hobbies. Discuss what you expect in terms of time alone and private time with friends."

It's a validation for them, but it's also a sign that you want them more than just physically. Here are some simple, real things you can do right away to become a better listener:


Ask questions about the things she says. If you can follow her conversation, you should be able to ask questions. Show her you’re listening actively, not passively.
Don't interrupt her. Interrupting a girl tells her that what you have to say is more important than what she has to say, which isn't always the case. Let her finish talking before you speak.
Listen to the best parts of her.Everyone has moments, or even whole days, that they'd like to forget. Forget the times when she was frazzled, or frustrated, or off her game. Listen to her best moments and prioritize those over her not-so-good moments. This will make her incredibly happy, and predispose her to do the same for you.;
, It doesn't have to be clockwork, but the idea is important. If she gives you a massage, give her a foot rub the next day. If she writes you a romantic letter on vacation, write her a romantic note and give it to her when she gets back. You want her to see how much work you're putting into the relationship. Remember, you're a reciprocator, not a parasite.


Don't be a robot about giving back every time you get something. That's not very romantic, and it probably won't impress your girl. Try to appear spontaneous, even if you're planning far in advance. It will make her a lot happier.
Don't forget to do things just because. Don't always make something tit-for-tat. Get her ice-cream before school or after work, and don't expect anything in return. You'll earn your karma in the long run.

, Be worthy of her trust. Guys may not care about it that much, but for girls, it's a really important issue: Trust helps them fend off guys until they've proven themselves. She won't truly let you inside until you show her you can be trusted.


Do not show romantic interest in her friends. Not even a single one of them. Stay steady as an arrow and clean as a whistle.
Always tell the truth, even if it hurts. Getting caught in a lie is much, much worse than fessing up to something unpleasant.
Be there for her when she needs it the most. When all her friends have deserted her, when she's feeling her awfullest, remind her that you're there for the long-haul. Send her a note saying how much she means to you; give her flowers; remind her of all the things that she does for other people that make her special to you.
Be as good as your word. This doesn’t just mean keeping a big promise every now and then; it means doing the dishes or picking up those socks like you said you would. If you say you're going to do something, follow through with it.

, Let's face it — she may never be mistaken for ""one of the guys."" But you can make an effort to include her into the gang every once in a while. Girls like feeling included, especially with other guys. It tells her that you're comfortable with her at your side — even with your boys — and that you're not embarrassed to her around the people you care most about., Open up. Self-disclosure is essential to bonding and has been shown to promote happy relationships.


Talk with her about your hopes, dreams and fears. Make sure the depth of these discussions is appropriate for the level of your relationship. Don't be an open book, but don't be afraid of showing her some vulnerability. Contrary to what you might think, vulnerability is sexy in her book,
Talk about your favorite songs, movies, books, and memories. These seemingly little things play a big role in forming an emotional connection. Don't be put off if she doesn't like every single one of your interests. If she likes you, she'll put up with your Metallica even if she's a Miley kind of girl.

, Don't be afraid to ask her if there's anything you can do to make her happier, or make the relationship better. Sometimes, honesty is just what the doctor ordered. Instead of playing games and trying to figure out what's wrong by fitting together all the tiny puzzle pieces, be blunt and ask her what she needs and what she wants. If something's wrong or could be better, she'll tell you. Be prepared to at least think about what she'd have you do.

, Tell her how much she means to you, what she's good at, or even what you like about her. Say something like ""Remember the first time we met? I fell head over heels for you when I saw you standing there. It's like everything else seemed to disappear, kind of like tunnel-vision. You still do that to me."" A nicely placed compliment or endearment can make her heart melt.


Don't overdo it. A nice compliment or ""I love you"" goes a long way every once in a while. But the more you use them, the cheaper they get. Remember, a diamond is valuable because it's so rare.

, A gentleman will treat a woman with patience, care, and attention, without making her feel out of place. Unless your girl absolutely doesn't like being treated differently because she's a different gender, you can make a lot of headway by taking the time to act like it's 1945. Here are some easy things you can do to show your girl you're a true gentleman.


Walk on the outside of the sidewalk; sleep on the side of the bed closest to the door. These two gentlemanly gestures are all about protection — positioning yourself in between harm and your lady. In the first case, you're protecting your girl from a possible car; in the second case, you're protecting your girl from a possible intruder.
Open doors and help the girl get seated when it's easy for you to do it. The key words here are ""easy."" You want to be a gentleman, but going out of your way to rush to the door in order to open it before she gets there seems like you'd be trying too hard. Try to be as casual as possible with these gentlemanly maneuvers.

, Everyone loves to be around a positive person. Your demeanor and how you carry yourself can affect how happy she is both with and without you.


Show that you're genuinely glad to see her. If your usual first reaction isn't a smile, there may be something wrong with the relationship. Consider hugging her or kissing her when you see her after a long day.
If you're just having a bad day, put it aside and grin. Make a self-deprecating joke about how you always seem to attract trouble. Put a smile on your face and be done with it.
Laugh at her jokes; everyone likes to think that they're funny. If they're not funny and you're not good at faking, just smile; a fake laugh is much worse than no laugh at all.

, She's not a maid or a cleaning service; she's not your personal cook; she's not there to simply to satisfy all your carnal desires. Don't do things that might make her feel any of these things. Don't smack her on the butt. Look at her when you're talking to her. If she feels like a person instead of a thing that exists solely for your pleasure, she'll be much more likely to be happy with you.

, There’s nothing sexy about reluctant sex. Honestly, you'll get a lot more sex, and better sex, if she's just as ready as you are.


If she seems hesitant, back off — even if she doesn't say anything. She may need more time to feel comfortable.
Don’t put out the wrong vibes. If she senses that you’re impatient, she may grow distant — or worse yet, do something she regrets.
Remember that no means no. Even if you’ve been together for years, it’s her body and she’s under no obligation to share it with you.
If she's an abuse survivor or something along those lines, that's a different situation entirely. Get her to talk to someone if she's not already.

, If you expect your girl to look like a Victoria's Secret model, how do you think she expects you to look? It's a double standard to expect girls to look great but to let your own grooming, hygiene, and exercise regimes to slip.


Shave every day, unless your girl likes a man with a beard. If you happen to have a beard, trim it regularly and keep it looking under, not out of, control.
Buy some semi-expensive gym clothes. If you buy gym clothes, you'll feel obligated to work out. If you feel obligated to work out, you won't skip out on your gym membership after school or at work.
Smelling odorless is better than smelling like you just stepped out of an Axe commercial. Girls like guys who smell subtly good. So don't drench yourself in cologne. Only use so much that she'll be enticed to get closer to you in order to catch a whiff.

, Women are just as turned off by neediness as men. Learn to give her a little space once in a while, even if it means letting her hang out with other guys. Trust in her and she'll want to live up to your trust.


Have a life of your own. A confident, independent person will never lack admirers.
Don't force-feed a budding relationship with too much affection. This is unhealthy and will raise red flags.

, It all depends on your own sense of humor and what she thinks is funny, but humor is routinely one of the most attractive things women look for in men.Whether it's jokingly poking fun of her ruthlessness, or reliving a joke you had when you were on spring break, humor is the lifeblood of happiness for both guys and girls. Don't forget that making fun of yourself in a joking way is another great way to get her to laugh.

, Knowing how to keep your head in a fight will make it productive instead of destructive. And as much as you may want to avoid confrontation, it’s far healthier to fight than to sweep things under the mat. Remember that if you really messed up, you might want to plan a special date to apologize.


Don't just change the subject when a fight is brewing. Forcing the conversation elsewhere will just create resentment.
If she’s really mad, give her a cooling period, then offer to work it out. Never forget to come back to the argument later or you will come off as evasive and/or uninterested.
Admit when you're wrong. Without humility, you will never learn from your mistakes.
Don't use an apology as a tool for ending an argument. This is manipulative and unproductive.

, Physical affection is just as important as verbal affection; it's just a different breed. While being careful to give your girl enough space and not appear clingy, it's important to physically show her how much you care for her. Here are some things that you can do:


Come up and slowly kiss the back of her neck while hugging her from behind. This soft, sensuous kiss is sure to get her excited and remind her of the sweet things you can do.
Nothing says ""I like you"" quite like a good foot massage or back massage. Learn how to give good ones and you'll never need another way to apologize!
Try a six-second kiss. A six-second kiss is a passionate way to help make your love last. Couples who regularly kiss for six seconds or longer last longer than those who don't."

How similar are your values, goals, and beliefs? Do you enjoy doing a few of the same things?

On the other hand, if your partner hasn’t done so, and doesn’t seem open to considering the idea any time soon, then he may be hesitant to commit to a relationship.Research also suggests that the more his friends and family approve of you, the less likely it is that the relationship will end., Does he answer promptly when you call or text? Does he make plans with you often, or is he constantly having to cancel? If your calls and texts often go unanswered, and if it seems as though he is somewhat reluctant to make plans with you, then they are probably unlikely to commit to a long-term relationship.For example, are there references to the future made (e.g. about spending christmas together)? This is a good sign that he wants you to be around in the future.

, If your partner is serious about a long-term relationship with you, his behavior will change around men or women who would normally interest him.For example, if you are a woman dating a man and a very beautiful woman walks by, does she steal all of his attention? If so, he may still be hoping to keep his options open. That’s not to say, though, that he will never even look at another girl. Only, that if he is committed, he won’t be entranced by the site.

, Does the thought of being along give you anxiety? If so, then you are more likely to feel that any relationship is ideal, rather than the right relationship.You should not be willing to lower your standards to make a relationship feel right.


It can be hard to be honest with yourself about something like this, but if you are searching for the right person, it doesn’t make sense to waste time with just any person.

, Are you really mature enough for a long-term relationship? In a long-term relationship, you have to consider the needs and wants of someone besides yourself. If you want to be successful in that relationship, you will also sometimes have to admit that you are wrong. This can be very difficult if you are still working on your maturity., Have you managed to become proud of who you are, flaws and all? Many people enter into relationships hoping that the other person will “fix” them, and make them happy. Unfortunately, this is not the case, at least not in the long-term. It is not an easy task, but it is important that you learn to make yourself happy without anyone else’s help.Understand that learning how to be happy is a difficult task for nearly everyone, and it won’t happen overnight.

, If you want your relationship to last, do your best not to criticize one another, especially when it comes to personal things.You’re not perfect, and neither is your partner. It does little good to point out all of the things they are doing wrong.


Some therapists suggest that, for each negative comment or criticism you make, you should try to make at least five positive comments about your partner to help offset the negative one.If your partner is doing something that is bothering you, think about why it is bothering you before saying anything. For example, maybe it annoys you that your partner bites his nails, but is it really harming you?

, If you have a friend who you trust, and who has spent a lot of time around you and your partner when you are together, then try asking them what they think. Research suggests that friends are generally better at predicting the outcome of your relationship than you will be., Do you guys often spend time joking around and having fun, or are you typically quite serious around one another? Research suggests that couples who are able to joke around together feel more connected.Remember, though, that this doesn’t mean you can’t/shouldn’t be serious sometimes. Some matters require you to be serious, and you will likely frustrate your partner if they feel you aren’t taking them seriously.

, If one of you believes that you are superior in some way, (e.g. have more money, in better shape, better looking, etc.) then you are less likely to last in the long-term.It is certainly likely that you do some things better, and that your partner does some things better. Instead of using these to compete, use them to work together.


For example, if you are a great cook, and your partner doesn't know how to boil water, then give them lessons. Find something that your partner does that you can't, and learn from them.

, This is important for any long-term relationship.If something has happened to undermine your or your partner’s trust, then steps must be taken to repair the trust.


This will require the person who broke the trust to hold themselves accountable, be honest, and perhaps even give up some of their privacy to prove their willingness to repair the relationship., This may seem obvious, but relationships take work, and the work must be done consistently over time in order to matter.This doesn’t mean you have to have a big surprise for your partner every single day. Instead, you can do small things.


For example, you can offer to cook dinner one night, or leave a note wishing them a nice day Give them a compliment for no reason. Small things can make a big difference in a relationship.

, One of the big reasons people have relationships in the first place is because it provides a source of support. If you’re not giving this to each other, then what’s the point? This doesn’t mean you have to agree with all of the choices your partner makes, but if he/she is struggling with a problem or decision, be positive and supportive.Remember that they should also be doing this for you, too!

, When trying to have a serious conversation with your partner, it is a good idea to have time set aside where you won’t be interrupted by phone calls, tv shows, or other people. Thus, it is a good time to ask your partner when they have time for such a conversation.


Some people feel nervous when their partner requests time for a conversation. Reassure your partner that you aren’t planning to break up with them (assuming that is the case), and that you hope the conversation will be a positive one.

, Tell your partner what your long-term goals are when it comes to relationships.This refers to what you have dreamt of in a relationship with the right person, not with your current partner specifically.


For example, whether or not you see yourself getting married, whether or not you want to have kids, what kind of home you see yourself living in (e.g. a large mansion or a small apartment in the city), whether you see yourself working or being a stay-at-home-mom (or dad).
If you’re afraid that your partner might just agree with your goals in order to avoid conflict, try asking them to tell you about their long-term goals first.
Be as honest as you possibly can, even if it means you disagree. If you don’t want the same things, one person shouldn’t be forced into a life they don’t want.
If it turns out you don’t want the same things in the long-term, remember that this doesn’t mean you absolutely must end the relationship immediately. If your goals are still along way off (e.g. you are both in high school or college, and have a lot of other things you want to do before getting married and having kids) and you enjoy spending time with each other, then you might wish to consider remaining in the relationship for the time being. However, it should be clear between both partners that no one is expected to change in order to remain in the relationship.
Relatedly, if you have differing goals, you should not remain in the relationship because you hope that the other person will change. Although it is possible that they will, it is more likely that they won’t. In this case, you will end up wasting each other’s times, and likely end up feeling very disappointed and resentful.

, If you plan to be in a long-term relationship, it is critical that you understand what is important to your partner. For example, is your partner very religious? Does your partner value monogamy, or does he/she see themselves in a polyamorous relationship in the future? Does your partner want to be lead a very social life and make lots of money someday, or does he/she want to live a quiet, modest life?


While you don’t have to agree on every single thing, having few values in common, and many that you strongly disagree about will make things very difficult.If you want a very quiet life, but your partner wants something else, it will be difficult to compromise.
Remember though, that having some differences can help you and your partner grow as people.

, This can be a scary conversation to have because you may find out that your partner sees you as the flavor of the week while you thought you might get married someday. However, it is important to have a conversation about this in order to be on the same page. Try to be as honest as possible, and if it turns out he/she doesn’t want the same thing, try to be respectful.


If it turns out that you don't want the same thing, try to remember that at least it is clear now, and that (should you choose to end the relationship) you can now move on to finding the person who does want a long-term relationship with you.
Try not to take it too personally if it doesn’t go the way you want. Just because your partner isn’t ready for a big commitment doesn’t mean that there is something wrong with you! It simply means that they have different goals, or is in a different place in their life than you are. If it is what you want, you will find the person that is right for you.

If it doesn’t work out with this guy, you’re going to need your friends to be there for you when it’s over. But even more than that, guys are interested in girls who have their own lives apart from them. Let him see that you have friends and that other people enjoy spending time with you. This will make him want to spend more time with you too., There’s nothing more attractive to a guy than a girl who doesn’t need him. Don’t be available to him every second of every day. Make plans with other people and live your life. This kind of behavior is what attracted him to you in the first place.


Call your girlfriends and go to the movies. Volunteer at your church. Do whatever you want to do with your time so that he’ll feel special when you’re able to spend time with him.

, There’s nothing more unappealing to a guy than knowing a girl is sitting at home waiting for him to call. It can seem a little desperate. If you want to stay home, that’s fine. But don’t tell him you are staying home in case he calls.


If he said he might call you tonight, don’t wait around to find out. That’s what cell phones are for. He can reach you while you’re out doing something. And then if he doesn’t call, you didn’t waste a whole night waiting around on him. Then you won’t be mad and he won’t feel the pressure you would have otherwise put on him.

, Assertiveness can be a very attractive quality. It involves setting healthy boundaries and expectations. This means that you should know what you want and you should take steps to go after it. Don’t let other people (your man included) dictate the direction of your life.It’s okay to be agreeable, but make sure that you have your own opinions so that people don’t walk all over you.

, Even if you are in a committed relationship, you are still in charge of your own life. You can still make your own decisions – small ones like where you want to eat dinner, and big ones like where you should go to college. Take responsibility for yourself and don’t let your decisions revolve around another person., Remember that he is a person with a life and needs just like you are. Remember that when you are thinking about his behavior. He probably values his sleep, so try not call him in the middle of the night expecting him to pick up. Think of how you'd feel if he did the same to you.


If you really need him – like in the case of a family emergency – don't get upset if he doesn't answer. Leave him a message and give him the opportunity to call you back
Calling or texting over and over is a sure way to make your guy annoyed with you and think you are obsessed., Try to be thoughtful, not assuming. If he is talking to another girl, don’t jump to conclusions. He may just be trying to be nice to her. Instead of confronting him about an idea that he is cheating, just remind him why he started dating you in the first place with something thoughtful like a note, a loving phone call, etc.Remember that you talk to other guys besides him. You are both allowed to interact with other people.

, You both had lives and interests before you met – that’s part of what attracted you to each other in the first place. Don’t expect him to give that all up for you. He still needs to spend time with his friends and do activities he enjoys.


Let him have a night out with the guys. It’ll be good for him to spend some time with his friends and it’ll give him a chance to miss you.
Healthy couples don’t spend all of their time together. You need outside interests to keep yourselves sane and happy.

, A solid relationship requires trust. If you violate that trust by checking up on your man, he might interpret that as obsessive behavior. But more importantly, snooping once will only lead you to want to snoop some more. And then you will be caught in a cycle of negative behavior.Avoid looking through his cell phone, checking his Facebook, or reading his private emails, no matter how tempting it might be to snoop.

, Don't put posters of him in your room or your locker, and don't have random mementos with his face on it. Be yourself – have your own interests and hobbies instead of instantly liking things just because he does. , Whether it’s joining a sports team at school or picking up cross-stitching, you need to let yourself enjoy the things that made you happy before this guy came into your life. Renew your interest in your old hobbies and start doing things that you love., If it is meant to be, it will happen. If you two are supposed to end up together, you will. Stressing about the details and making yourself crazy with this obsession will not guarantee his love. In fact, it might ensure that you lose it. When you admit that you’re not in control of everything and allow your relationships to develop more naturally, you will find yourself surrounded by people who love you and fulfill you in a much more powerful way., When you find yourself obsessively thinking about him, don’t give in to those thoughts. Do something to take your mind off of him. Dwelling on these kinds of thoughts is a negative behavior that will lead to more unhappiness. And the longer you allow yourself to give in to these thoughts, the harder the habit will be to break eventually.Try calling a friend or finishing your homework. Start on a fun project you’ve been putting off. Or you could even turn on the television to distract yourself.

Keep him intrigued.,
Find out what he likes.,
Find the balance between independence and making sure he's loved.,
Make him feel like a man.,
Keep public displays of affection to a minimum.,
Be confident and look great.,
Don't do anything too sexual until your relationship is close and comfortable.,
Give him massages!,
If he's been in fewer relationships than you, be patient and understanding if he doesn't quite comprehend the basic rules of living together.,
Find out who he is.",How to Keep a Man Interested," If he likes what he knows so far, he'll make sure to come around more often to find out more. Don't be a completely open book, unless that's who you are naturally. Give the relationship time to simmer, and space out some of your revelations so that you still have the ability to surprise him.


Maintain a little bit of mystery. Don't tell him every little thing you're doing, every place you've been to, every person you've seen. Even if you didn't want to be a little mysterious, sharing every little detail about your past and your whereabouts is likely to be draining to a man.






Keep some surprises up your sleeve. Being hunters, explorers, and daredevils, men naturally love surprises. If you schedule a surprise — going skydiving, for example, or a cruise — don't be afraid to just whisk him away and not tell him about it until he's right in the thick of it.;
, Everyone likes to talk about themselves. It's a natural fact of life. Instead of dwelling on you and your past relationships, ask him questions that show him you are interested in him. If you get him going about his past and his experiences — and can stand sitting through the occasional boring story — he'll feel like he's connected with you and has a bigger bond to build on.


If he likes a certain color, it wouldn't hurt to wear that color every once in a while. If he likes a certain food, it wouldn't hurt to surprise him with lunch or dinner.






Most of our communities are increasingly pluralistic with people from numerous different cultural and ethnic backgrounds. If he is of a different culture from you try as much as you can to read and know a thing or two about his heritage. He will love that.

In other words, pamper him a little bit. Women loved to be pampered, but so do men. They're just afraid to ask for it for fear of not seeming ""manly"". Remember, don't coddle or mother him, but do record his favorite TV shows, get him tickets to a game (he can invite his buddies if you don't want to go), or get him that razor he's been talking about. It shouldn't go unnoticed.

, Guys are naturally independent, meaning they need a little more space than most women do. Make sure he feels like he has a life outside of you. As much as he likes you, nothing pains him more than to look at his life and realize that he's lost touch with his friends and no longer gets the respect for wearing the pants, so to speak. Give him space some of the time.


And if you're worried about trust, don't be. Trust him. If he gives you a reason not to trust him, then you can start questioning his motives. The truth is that if you trust him and he likes you, he won't want to give you a reason to revoke that trust. If you don't trust him when you should, he'll want to punish you for not trusting him.

, There's nothing wrong with boosting a man's ego. It makes him feel good about himself and if he feels good about himself because of a certain someone, he'll want to keep her around. More than likely, he'll also return the favor.


Reinforce the way he wants to be viewed. Does he consider himself an athlete? Tell him how muscular, coordinated, or skilled he is. Does he consider himself an intellectual? Tell him how smart and profound he is. Does he consider himself a comedian? Laugh at his jokes and set him up to be funny.
Let him be chivalrous. Pay attention to all the ""gentlemanly"" things he does for you and acknowledge them. When he opens the door, pays for your meal, or lets you in first, make him feel special!
Know that he'll most likely act different around his guy friends. Never tolerate outright disrespect, but if he acts a little strange, it's because he's trying to impress his boys. If it doesn't offend you, let him.

, Men don't necessarily like to be forced into holding your hand and kissing you in public. If he does anyway, that's a bonus, and he's probably a very decent guy. If not, don't try to make him. Don't be upset or angry if he feels awkward about doing it; males are closed-off creatures and don't like to show their 'soft sides' to the public.


If you need a man who is comfortable showing his love to you in public, tell him gently. Let him know it's a priority to you, but that you understand it might not be a top priority for him. If he really likes or loves you, he'll be open to compromise.

, He prefers you to other girls, so show you're proud of yourself! And when it comes to looking great, know your guy. Some guys are attracted to natural beauty; others like a spray tan and eyelashes. Either way, dress to show that you're comfortable and confident with your body but make sure you don't go over the top.


Don't compare yourself to other women. Not even in a way that seems acceptable. To a guy, this comparison screams ""insecurity,"" and the guy is suddenly worried that he might have to be your psychologist instead of your boyfriend.

, Starting too early causes the initial excitement to quickly drain from a relationship. Why? Because guys (and girls, for that matter) like challenges. As twisted as it may seem, he likes the chase almost as much as anything else. Give him a good chase (without being too hard-to-get), and he'll be around for the whole hunt.


As a general rule of thumb: expect a kiss or two the first couple of dates; some heavy petting perhaps the next couple of dates; and consider, not necessarily agree to, sex only after the fifth date. If you go on a date every week, this will give you more than a month to suss him out. If you still don't feel comfortable, make him wait.






Once you have developed a sexual relationship, try to keep it interesting. A couple things to consider as you explore each other's sexuality:






Initiate sex at least some of the time. Guys don't always want to be the one asking for it. They certainly want sex, but it makes them feel greedy. Initiate some of the time and you'll keep him happy.
Ask him what his fantasies are. If you're comfortable with acting them out, give them a try. There's nothing sexier to a guy than a girl who cares about his deepest desires.
Help him feel adequate. Be open about what he can do to please you sexually. Give him encouragement when he does something good. Never tease or make jokes about length, performance, etc., as guys are especially sensitive about it.



, After a long hard day at work and stress of after-work traffic, men love to be given a nice body, back, or foot massage. If you have the time and energy, throw in a pedicure and manicure. You may even get the same treatment in return, especially if you ask for it! A guy who won't give you a nice long massage after you've given one to him doesn't deserve to have you dote on him.

, Men find it difficult to understand why they should let you watch your favorite chick flick, even though you have already patiently sat through a four-hour basketball game, and went to watch Transformers just to make him happy. Similarly, there is a chance that they are reluctant to do housework.


Try to resolve issues calmly through conversation. Listen to his perspective, stay calm, and be open to compromise. At the same time, gently show him your perspective and suggest something actionable, not abstract — i.e. ""I'll be happy to do the laundry if you can be in charge of garbage and recycling.""






Don't hound him about things. He'll feel like you've turned into his mother, and probably not in a good way. Quietly expect him to do what you've asked him to do — remember the rule about trust? — and give him time to get it done. If he doesn't, explain to him in rational terms why it's important. Sometimes, a push is all men need.

, We spend our lives looking for someone who we think understands us the way that our family and loved ones do. If you can assure him, much less show him, that you understand him at times better than he understands himself, he'll have a hard time leaving you.

",How to Live Together After Having a Long Distance Relationship," Talk about living together often before you actually do it. Obviously, visiting each other in your far-away respective homes does not reflect the everyday life you will have together, since at least one of you is always on vacation whenever you meet. If you do have chances to visit, be aware of ""the little things"" that characterize your home and the home of your partner. What are the things you find endearing? What are the differences?;
, Of course you have been waiting to be together for a long time. Many conversations started out with ""When we live together, we will...all the time. That will be so cool!"" Try to lose the rose-colored glasses and be aware that some things might annoy you about each others habits or preferences. That is completely normal and you - just like many other couples - will be able to sort it out together. Just don't expect YOUR cohabitation to be ""totally different"" because you are looking forward to it so much.

, Rank them in the order of their priority. Try not to include more than 3-5 ""must-haves"" on your list, and no ""not-at-all-possibles"". Ask your partner to make a list as well. Then go over your lists together with an open mind. Be prepared to compromise. (S)he might be willing to compromise on something they are not too keen on (like having a dinner table the size of Kansas), so be willing to compromise as well. It's a give and take.

, Make sure all the bureaucratic issues are taken care of if you are an international couple. Your partner might need a residency permit or a green card. Research all of the information on the website of your country's ministry of foreign affairs. If you are both planning to live together in a country that is foreign to both of you, make sure you have all the necessary documents and valid passports well in advance.

, Are you a neat freak or more free and chaotic? If you have completely different styles, try to make arrangements that can accommodate both of you without being stifling. There is no point in pretending you are effortlessly neat if you're not. Not only is it dishonest, but eventually you will go back to who you really are. Be open about that from the start to make it easier for both of you. For example, find an apartment that allows you to have a desk/workplace that you can organize any way you like without messing up the ambiance of a room or getting into each others way, if that is your main priority.


Different approaches can be helpful here. If you don't care about having a ""personalized"" desk, for example, but you can't live without having the bed facing the window or setting up your recliner in the living-room even though your partner thinks it's hideous, work from there and give them their ""favourite"" space to set up or decorate. The ultimate goal is to create as much comfort and feeling at home as possible for both of you in your own way.

, Depending on whether you both will move to a foreign place together, or you follow your partner or he/she follows you, make allowances for settling in a foreign country- or even a different state. The stress of finding your way around and understanding people can hit you unawares in all the anticipation and create unnecessary pressure when you are trying to settle in together.


Prepare by taking language classes and/or cultural seminars in advance (if you are a Westerner moving to Japan, for example).
If you are staying put and your (international) partner is following you, be especially supportive and helpful to him or her while he/she adjusts to whatever is different from their home country. Even if they were comfortable with the cultural differences during visits, changing your permanent place of residence to a foreign country with only your partner as a ""lifeline"" can make you feel lost. Encourage them to learn as much about the changes in advance as possible.

, All the practical things will have to be adjusted as you go along, but your appreciation for the physical closeness of having your partner around will be very rewarding. Keep your communication as open as it was when you were apart. Don't expect anything to clear itself up ""all by itself"", however. Address issues that bother you before you get too agitated. Be calm, clear, and non-accusatory in your discussions.

, Of course each of you has dreamed about this moment and envisioned it differently. Strive to reconcile your ideas and remember that moving in together takes work and a phase of adjustment for any couple, not just you.

Give him space when he needs it.,
Talk through any issues.,
Show a little love and appreciation.,
Remember that a relationship is a two way street.",How to Keep Your Man Happy1," Even if your man is head-over-heels crazy for you, he needs a little alone time every now and then, so don't try to force your presence on him 24 hours a day.


Make some plans without him and tell him he's free to go play video games, have a beer with his friends or go for a solo run -- whatever he feels like.
This also gives you a chance to pursue your own interests and maintain a fulfilling life outside of your relationship.
Once you accept that you both need some personal space every now and then, you will be much happier as a couple and will enjoy and appreciate the time you do spend together a lot more as a result.;
, Instead of bottling up any issues or problems you have with your relationship (and letting them all explode in a whirlwind of emotion later), sit your man down and have a calm, reasoned discussion with him.


He'll appreciate this much more than a potential screaming match down the road and will be much more inclined to listen to you and take on board what you're saying, rather than going on the defensive.
You should also give him the chance to voice any issues he may be having. Really try listen to what he has to say and don't dismiss his concerns. Your man will be much happier in the relationship if he feels like his feelings and opinions are valued.

, Most modern-day husbands and boyfriends are pretty amazing -- they do things like buy you flowers, cook you dinner and massage your feet after a long day at work. So reciprocate, ladies!


Don't take all of the small, wonderful things your man does for you for granted, or as a given. Let him know how much you appreciate him and that you know how hard he tries.
When he does something nice for you, be affectionate. Give him a kiss or a hug or just tell him you love him. Knowing how happy he's made you will make him happy!

, Of course, making your husband or boyfriend happy is pointless if you are not happy.


A relationship works both ways, so if you're putting in all of the effort and getting nothing in return, you have to ask yourself ""is it worth it?""
Even if your relationship is going fine, there may be something else bothering you and making you unhappy. You need to fix this -- otherwise, your man will sense your unhappiness and start to feel unhappy himself, especially if is nothing he can do about it.

Be honest with him.,
Compliment him.,
Don't try to make him jealous.,
Be his support system.,
Respect him.",How to Keep Your Man Happy2," When it comes to relationships, we all know that honesty is the best policy. Lies always come back to bite us in the end.


Being honest with your man about where you're going, who you're meeting, how you're feeling, etc. is important. How can you expect honesty from him if you don't afford him the same courtesy?
Even if he doesn't necessarily like the truth, the fact that you are being honest with him will let him know that he can trust you -- and trust is essential in any relationship.

, Men love to be complimented just as much as women, so don't be stingy with your praise!


When you're impressed with something your guy has said or done, tell him so! Don't just assume he knows.
Tell him he looks good in a suit, that you're impressed with the project he's working on or that you're amazed at what he can do in the bedroom! A genuine compliment from you and he'll be walking on cloud nine!
Bonus points if you compliment him in front of his friends or family -- men like to be praised in front of other people, it boosts their ego.

, Many women make the mistake of trying to make their man feel jealous when they're angry or upset with them.


However, this often backfires by making your husband or boyfriend feel angry, hurt or betrayed -- and this can damage his trust in you, harming the relationship.
Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot -- if you had done something wrong, would you want him to hear you out and give you another chance? Or would you prefer him to flirt with another women to get back at you? That's what we thought.

, Everybody has their low points, your man included. So don't kick him while he's down by criticizing or saying ""I told you so"". Be his support system and take this as an opportunity to boost him back up.


If he has a bad day at work, has an argument with a family member or is generally just feeling a bit down, try to be nice to him. Ask him if he wants to talk about it or allow him to brew silently for a while, if that's what he needs.
Remind him of all the reasons why you think he's great and why you chose him out of all the other fish in the sea. Make him feel good about himself again and he'll feel happy and grateful towards you.

, Your man needs you to respect him, the same way you need him to respect you. Don't belittle him or put him down all the time -- that's no way to treat the most important person in your life!


The last thing your guy wants is to feel emasculated, so allow him to feel like a man from time to time -- ask him to open a jar, to build some furniture or to drive your car.
Let him know that you depend on him -- it will boost his ego and make him feel good about himself.
This doesn't make you any less of a strong women, it's just part of being in an equal, reciprocal relationship.

Ask him to undress and lie face down on the bed, then work your magic. Gently knead his back, neck and shoulders, avoiding the spine. If you're feeling adventurous, you can attempt a full-body massage.
Be generous with your time -- try to keep it up for at least 15 to 20 minutes until your man has completely relaxed. Be warned though -- all that skin-on-skin contact may leave your man feeling more turned-on than relaxed!

, Whoever said that the way to a man's heart was through his stomach never spoke a truer word. Men love food, especially when it's lovingly prepared by their other half.


Pick a recipe (or steal one from his mother) and prepare it some evening when he's least expecting it. Make it an occasion -- set the table nicely, open a good bottle of wine and pretend you're eating out at a restaurant!
By the way, we're not advocating 50s housewife behavior here: ""you must have a hot meal on the table when your man arrives home from work."" We're talking about cooking a nice meal for you man because you want to and because it's a nice thing to do.
If you're a terrible cook, improvise! Order his favorite take-out but serve it on nice dishes or take him out to his favorite restaurant for dinner, your treat!

, If you're in a long-term relationship, it's easy to let routine take over and stay in watching TV every Saturday night. Keep your man happy by doing something spontaneous or different instead!


Inject some fun into your man's life by planning date nights -- get concert tickets, go rock climbing, organize a wine tasting, go to an art exhibition, host a games night with some other couples -- anything as long as it's different.
If you're feeling adventurous, plan something really crazy like a joint skydive, a whale-watching trip or a vacation or road trip. Take care of as many of the details beforehand as possible, so your man doesn't have to stress on the day.

, Again, we're not advocating a 50s housewife approach here, but taking some pride in your appearance and looking good for your man is definitely a good thing. You want him to feel proud that you are his wife or girlfriend!


We all have days when we want to laze around in our pajamas, with no make-up on and hair scraped back, but every so often it's nice to get dressed up for no other reason than wanting to look good for your man. He'll appreciate the effort!
You should also make an effort to do the things you used to do when you first met -- whether that means shaving your legs, getting your hair styled once a month, or keeping your weight in check. Try to be the girl he fell in love with!

, No discussion of how to keep a man happy would be complete without some reference to sex! Although this may vary a little, most men love it when their lady takes charge in the bedroom.


This means something different in every relationship, whether it's simply initiating sex (especially if you don't normally) or tying your man down, dominatrix style.
Give him a freebie every once in a while -- in other words, a sexual favor where you expect nothing in return. He'd prefer that to an actual gift any day of the week!
Remember that being intimate (whatever that means for you) is an important part of any healthy, happy relationship -- it brings the two of you closer together and allows you to express your love for one another in a deeply personal way.

View women as individuals.,
Recognize that men and women communicate in much the same way.,
Recognize that some women are silenced because of social conditioning.,
Cultivate active listening skills.,
Pursue friendships with women.",How to Improve Your Perspective on Women1," It is important that you not view women as one singular group and instead recognize their differences. Remember that there is as much variation within the category of ""women"" as there is within the category of ""men."" This will help you to you avoid creating stereotypes and generalizations based upon an isolated negative experience. You may have had a bad experience with one woman or even several, but that does not mean that every woman will behave the same way towards you.;
, Many people believe that men and women communicate in fundamentally different ways. However, studies generally show that men and women communicate in very similar ways, using similar words and cues.Tell yourself that women are not speaking another language: they are speaking the very same language that you speak. Talk to women in exactly the same way you would wish to be spoken to.

, Even though men and women communicate in very similar ways, there are some power dynamics that do lead to some noticeable differences in how women and men communicate. For example, there has been some evidence that men might be more likely to interrupt than women and that women are less likely to speak up at work.In order to resist this conditioning, try the following:


Do not talk over women when they are speaking.
Invite women to contribute to the conversation.
Appoint just as many women as men to lead meetings and make presentations.

, Active listening is a difficult but important task in communication. While active listening is a tool to use when speaking with members of any gender, it can be a particularly effective means of communicating with women, who sometimes are silenced and spoken over. Active listening requires that you do the following:


Prioritize understanding others over being understood yourselfRestate another person's point to ensure that you understood them correctlyAvoid distractions such as the phone or televisionAsk open-ended questions instead of leading questionsMake eye contactLegitimize the other person's feelings and concernsSuspend your judgmentsShow curiosity about the other person's interests and passions, Many people are suspicious of friendships between men and women.However, having friendships with members of the opposite sex can help you learn how to broaden your perspectives on life and introduce you to new ways of thinking.Resolve to become friends with more women without expectations of romance or sex: this will help you view women more sympathetically in the future.

Take advantage of new technology; text and send e-cards.,
Hold hands, hug and give quick kisses often.,
Date often.,
Write old fashion love letters.,
Praise, praise and thank you…..and more praise.

,
Rather than concentrating on what he or she “doesn’t do anymore”, think about what he/she does.,
Learn something “new” together.,
Make love often and with passion.,
Strengthen your art of conversation.,
Be a good listener.,
Take care of yourself; mind, body and spirit.",How to Keep the Romance in Your Relationship," With so many of us pressed for time, why not use technology to “keep in touch” during the day. A compliment, an affection or a quick “Hello, You are being thought of” via text can spark anyone’s day. E-cards are fast, and convenient. There are many sites that allow you to send them for free. You can find any type of sentiment from cute and funny, to serious and romantic or teasingly sexy. The bonus is that you can include a personal message along with it if you’d like.;
, Nothing is as good for the soul and the emotional health of a person as the human touch. As teenagers, we hold hands, give quick kisses as hello and goodbye and cuddle as we sit close. Why not keep that sense of youth no matter how old we are or how long we have been have together as a couple? Holding hands keeps a connection and closeness, no matter what we are doing. An enthusiastic hug uplifts us; a quick kiss says “glad to see you”.

, Set dates and anticipate them with excitement. Dress up and look your best. Discover a new cologne or perfume. Set the stage as if you are trying to “impress” the way you did at the beginning of the relationship. If your budget limits you to a rental movie at home, change it up. Set out cheese and crackers instead of the usual popcorn. Turn off the lights and let your fireplace illuminate the room. No fireplace? Candles do just as well. The point is to set the atmosphere of a date. The desire to look your best, feel your best and have the best time possible will rejuvenate those feelings of a first date.

, There is nothing like the power of the written word. The idea that a person would sit and attempt to convey their feeling through words is not only a heart warming gesture, but one that can be renewed over and over again through each reread. Rereading a partner’s love letters instantly brings you to the intensity when the relationship was young. Writing letters throughout the relationship tells your partner those feelings are still alive and well.

,, He may not bring you flowers as he did in the beginning of your courtship, but his consideration in packing your lunch or giving you some time with the girls is another type of “ blossom”. If she doesn’t seem to be as affectionate as when you first dated, appreciate her watching the game with you, especially if she is not a sports fan. The saying “seeing your glass full or half empty” has validity. If we compliment people on what they DO, instead of harping on what they don’t, we’d be surprised how responsive a person can be. Being appreciated with a “thank you”, makes most people enthusiastic about doing more. Complimenting your partner on their qualities of patience or creativity will easily be a high point in their day. And with enough Thank yous and compliments, you never know. That bouquet of flowers might just follow.

, Take dance lessons, take an art class or learn to ice skate together! Take a day trip to a new place neither of you have ever visited before. If you look back on your life, you probably connected with people whom you shared new events or experiences, something you experienced together for the first time. Those experiences create closeness. Find something that can be a “first” for the two of you. You might also develop a new interest the two of you can enjoy!

, The beauty of a long term sexual relationship is the intimacy builds over the years. That intimacy makes sex much more genuine, gratifying and fulfilling. It is also an area that is not often put high on the importance scale. Work, career, school, and kids often exhaust our energy so we find it hard to “be in the mood”. Make the intimate part of your relation a high priority. Make time for “love sessions”. Take time to “make love” rather than just have sex. Use candles, perfume, or whatever that is what get your juices flowing. Like all else in life, intimacy dies if it is not nourished. Feeding it with affection, compliments and time will make it something that feels less like an obligation at the end of a hard day, but something to look forward to.

, If you find yourself with “nothing to talk about anymore”, find something to start the conversation. Fill your partner in on the “funny “things that happened at work, the gossip; anything trivial and interesting. Remember, we all need to use our partners as a “sounding board”, but if that is the only conversation that we are having with our“significant other”, even the most sympathetic listener can have a breaking point. Make “sharing your day”, a pleasure event, not a dreaded evil.

, There still is the time when your partner will need you to be there, just to listen. You have probably heard the joke a thousand times and heard the family issue twice that often, so listening to your partner is not always easy. The extra effort, however, can be priceless. Remember, often people don’t want their problems solved, just a shoulder to lean on. Taking away the burden of “fixing it”, might make it easier.

, Be passionate about life. There is truth to the belief that if we nourish the child in us our spirits can stay young, even when our outer body doesn’t. Stay young in mind and spirit. Take care of your health, emotional and physical. It is much easier to keep a relationship young when you exude that aura yourself. Start by keeping yourself “young at heart”. Keeping a relationship vibrant for years can be a challenge, but that doesn’t have to be a negative. As with all challenges, once achieved, the success becomes much sweeter, the accomplishment more exhilarating. That kind of energy is certain to give a kick start to anyone’s relationship!

Put your hand near his/hers.,
Move your hand even closer, and soon, very slowly put your hand in his/hers.,
If your boyfriend or girlfriend seems to be enjoying himself/herself, holding hands with you, this is good.,
Congrats!,
Move on to hugs, more touching, and maybe a little kissing!,
Don't feel embarrassed!",How to Hold Hands With Your Girl/Boy Friend," This works well if you are sitting or walking next to each other, but make sure his/her hand is at his/her side. Hold your hand very close to his/hers, even maybe touching a bit, but look straight ahead. Don't freak out or stare down at your hands.;
, Close it around his/her hand. This would be a good time to look up at him/her. If he/she just stares at you, smile. If he/she pulls away, just quit all together. He/She is just not ready to do this yet.

, He/she is comfortable with this, and if you think you are ready, intertwine your fingers in his/hers. He/She will eat this up!

, You are holding hands with your cutie! If he/she doesn't like it, don't worry! He or she is nervous and just not ready! If he or she pulls away, do not try to hold hands with him/her again that day!

, This is a slower process. Do not move into this too fast. If you do, he/she will think that you are a creep and will make fun of you behind your back.

, It's okay if he/she either jerks away, or looks down. Everyone has his/her own speed. If you freak out he/she will understand. But just keep trying different days until he/she is ready. If you don't feel comfortable, you are okay! Holding hands isn't the most important thing to do in a relationship.

Talk about daily routines.,
Encourage keeping a food log.,
Check out the pantry.,
Model positive changes.,
Encourage your partner.",How to Help Your Overweight Girlfriend or Boyfriend Be Healthy1," There can be many reasons for a person to be overweight, from inactivity to health concerns. Before you assume that your partner is just inactive, talk to him about his daily routine.Ask a question as a way to get a conversation started. Be sure to listen and respond rather than asking a series of questions because this may come across as interrogating. Ask things like:


”How many hours of sleep do you get a night? Do you feel tired when you wake up?”
”Do you get up and walk around during the day?""
”How active would you say you are? Do you work out? If so, what sort of activity do you do?”;
, It is easy to underestimate how many calories we actually eat each day.Encourage your partner to keep a food log to report what she is actually eating per day. This can be a personal wake up call and/or quantitative reasoning for weight gain. You can encourage your partner to do this by showing her your own food log and telling her that even athletes keep food logs.


There are many free applications available to help you keep a food log. Some even allow you to scan barcodes of food that will automatically enter information for you.

, Pay attention to the types of foods your partner brings home and try to provide some healthy options. Check out what sorts of foods he has in his pantry and refrigerator. It can be difficult to resist tempting junk food, no matter how good the intention.Look for:


Cookies/Biscuits.
Chips.
Sweets.
Alcohol.
Soft drinks.

, It might be easier for your partner to follow a program or make healthier choices if he sees you doing the same.Be consistent in your own health routine and diet. Try and model healthy behavior by:


Preparing healthy foods (and perhaps sharing recipes with your partner).
Eating a healthy diet.
Keeping an exercise routine.
Sharing personal goals/worries with your partner.

, Above all, your are in a partnership. You need to be encouraging to the needs and goals of your partner. Try to:


Be a cheerleader, not a taskmaster. You should encourage your partner to be healthy and happy. Telling what they have to do or should do can breed resentment and unhappiness.Develop incentives. Reward your partner if they stick with a program or change bad habits into good. Do not focus on food, as this might backfire, but consider a nice date or a small present.
Care about them as a person, not a number. Remind them why you are with them and why you love them.

Identify your hidden biases.,
Embrace a zero-tolerance policy in the workplace.,
Listen carefully to women's opinions.,
Support women leaders.,
Be on the lookout for sexist language or insults.,
Call out gender stereotypes in the media.,
Attend diversity training workshops.,
Improve your perspective on yourself.,
Do not dwell on negative interactions with women.",How to Improve Your Perspective on Women2," Recent studies have found that even very caring teachers can exhibit sexist and racist behaviors in the classroom, such as listening more carefully to boys than to girls.These unconscious biases can be harder to identify and remedy than more blatant sexist actions (such as sexual harassment).Tell yourself that even though you are a very caring and good person, there are structures at play that might make you view women in a sexist way. Some of the more common stereotypes people have about women include the following:Women are small or weak
Women are passive
Women are supposed to pay more attention to their appearance than men
Women care more about domestic duties than ""hard"" skills such as science, math, or engineering
Women are flirtatious and manipulative

, As many as 15% of women report experiencing bias in the workplace.Improve your perspective on women--and improve women's experiences in the office--by supporting zero-tolerance policies in your workplace. Such policies help ensure that women are paid equitably and are not harassed because of their gender. If your office has a positive view of women, you will likely follow suit.

, Whether consciously or not, some men automatically believe men more readily than they believe women. This can lead to women feeling singled out or misunderstood.To improve your perspective on women, try to listen carefully whenever a woman speaks her mind. Before dismissing her opinion as silly or inconsequential, ask yourself whether you would believe what she was saying if she were a man. Confront your own biases head-on in order to treat women respectfully.

, Studies show that people--even other women--are more suspicious of women leaders than leaders who are men. This effect can be seen even among children and teenagers.Be supportive of women and girls who display excellent leadership qualities such as forthrightness, intelligence, and effective problem-solving abilities. Encourage your children to do the same in order to build an entire generation with an improved perspective on women.Encouraging the women and girls in your life to attend leadership conferences and activities is another great way to support women in leadership positions., Unfortunately, women are often demeaned through biased language. Pay attention to the words used around you: do you notice any sexist insults or patronizing language used toward women? Watch your own language, and encourage those around you to watch their language as well.Some unconsciously sexist language that might enter your vocabulary includes the following words and phrases:


Universalized male subjects--such as assuming all persons of consequence are a ""he""Specifying ""women's"" issues as a fringe subcategory. For example, some people might refer to a ""women's"" sports team, which implies that ""real"" sports do not include women.Be wary of terms like ""women's literature,"" ""chick flicks,"" and the like.
Patronizing pet names used for women who are coworkers, acquaintances, or strangers. These include things like ""sweetie,"" ""sweetheart,"" ""honey,"" or ""darling.""
Commenting about a woman's appearance in an inappropriate situationReferring to women by their first names when you refer to men by their last names or titlesCalling adult women ""girls""

, Many mainstream movies depict the lives of men more than the lives of women.Moreover, many movies and shows that portray women do so in a sexist way, where women are valued for their appearance more so than for their bravery, intelligence, or morality.Be on the lookout for stereotypes against women in the media. By spotting them, you can help resist their implications.

, While diversity training is not a sufficient tool for improving your perspective on women, it can raise awareness about gender bias and stereotyping.Perhaps your work requires diversity training, or perhaps there are optional workshops you can attend through your professional organization. Attend these programs and pay careful attention to the specific suggestions the diversity training provides. For example, the diversity training workshop might let you know about how to improve sexist language, how to encourage women to succeed in the workplace, and how to respect all women you encounter through work.

, Studies show that men are more likely to exhibit sexist behaviors when they are feeling anxious or insecure about themselves.Try to find ways to bolster your own self-confidence without relying on women to be either a damsel in distress (for you to rescue) or to be a villain (for you to compete with). Instead, work on improving your job skills, pursue your creative pursuits, and view yourself positively.


If you find yourself in a negative pattern where you treat women badly during your lowest periods--such as when you have gone through a breakup or have a stressful day at work--consider talking to a therapist. A therapist can provide you with better ways to improve your self-confidence.

, Your past negative experiences with women do not apply to all women in all situations. To put your past behind you, you should express your anger but take care not to dwell on it.Get out and be social to start creating new memories and experiences. Most importantly, avoid inflating a single bad experience into more than it really was. Be rational, and avoid hyperbolic language such as the words ""never"" and ""always."""

Consume art made by women.,
Write down a list of all of the positive female influences in your life.,
Learn about women's history.",How to Improve Your Perspective on Women3," Many people assume that the best art is created by white men. For example, many book reviewers publicize novels written by men over those written by women.This can hurt the public's ability to understand women's stories and perspectives. Resolve to consume just as much art created by women as that created by men. Go to the library and check out books written by female writers, seek out female journalists, and pay attention to the works of female sculptors, visual artists, musicians, and filmmakers. You might find that new worlds open up to you.


Try to look at this art as true art made for the world: not as niche art made solely for women. Resist the idea that men are the only ones capable of speaking to all of humanity through their art.

, Try to focus on the women who have helped you in any circumstance, no matter how small or large. Such positive female influences may include your mother, grandmother, school teachers, college professors, and co-workers. By making this list, you will begin to see the positive contributions women have made to your life. Express your gratitude to these women who have made a positive impact.

, Read a book about women's role in society throughout history, or take a course on women's history at a local college or university. This will help you to embrace and recognize how women have been treated over the centuries. It will help you recognize and sympathize with the difficulties women have faced in the past. If you have a negative or misogynistic perspective on women, you can overcome this attitude by learning about how far women's rights have come and the benefits this has brought to society.


Be aware that much of women's history takes on the perspective of white women instead of women of color. Try to seek out women's history that focuses on minority perspectives to ensure that your sense of history is balanced."

Base your love on what's on the inside, not on appearance.,
Learn to talk things over.,
Consider how compatible you are with the person you're with.,
Hold back unkind and beastly things.,
Be careful of chasing family approval.,
Base your relationship on respect and honesty.,
Let each other have hobbies that don't include each other.,
Keep love alive.,
Remember the following for the short summary of what to do to keep your relationship going:

Looks are not that important because love has no color shape or form.",How to Keep a Relationship Going After 15 Years," It you get together with someone because they're ""hot"", it becomes a routine, then you are living together the relationship goes so fast that there is no time to think or act. Then, in a blink of an eye it's over. Lasted a good month or two, not sure what or where the relationship went wrong––it just did. The trouble is that looks don't last and are never enough to keep you together .Looks are not all that important to make a relationship work long term, because looks are superficial and eventually it's wrinkles, flab, a beer gut, saddle bags, and hair loss. So, in the end, what counts is whether this person makes you happy, is marriage a possibility, and whether you can count on them for better or worse.

, It is important to talk openly when you're together because the unknown keeps you both in the dark. Fear, failure and the unknown can plague a relationship. In other areas of life you seek to find out all you can about failures within relationships, such as when you're fired from a job or you miss out on a place at college, etc. Take your same courage to ask questions, talk about things and learn from other areas of life and apply them to your most intimate relationship as well.


Once you realize your weaknesses with respect to a relationship, you can begin working on them and make needed corrections.

, This applies to both men and women––to succeed long term, compatibility is essential. If the relationship seems shaky or you have a sense of it not feeling right, it is time to walk away. You won't get a long term commitment and fulfillment if you don't feel that you're both the right fit. If you feel guilty, unhappy or bored in a relationship, this isn't going to keep going. The real goal is to find the right compatibility and, like yin and yang, you complete each other in your own ways, while both remaining happy, no matter the challenges that life inevitably brings.


Don't stay in a relationship just because you feel sorry for a person or want to fix their mistakes. That will be an unhealthy relationship and won't last long-term.

, You may think them but don't give them life by voicing them. Don't say what you will regret later. In many relationships, there are times when we get mad with the other person or let off steam about something touching both of, you in their presence. You can't take back mean things said and intended to really wound and it's worse because you know one another's weak points. You know it hurts when it's used against you. The best response is to just look, listen, then walk away. If you feel the need to say something wounding, excuse yourself and walk away until you cool down.


Learn to accept the bad with the good and keep the peace.
Remember that the world already slams you. Why get it from or give it to the one person you're spending eternity with? The person you marry is not only your mate, they are your best friend, your confidante, your guide, and your protector. So, watch what you say in the heat of the moment.
Remember that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all.

, It's nice to have their approval but often it won't happen. Sometimes it happens that your family dislikes your spouse or his/her family dislikes you. Remind yourself who is going to sleep and live with your spouse––you or his/her family? Put yourselves before family and ignore the feuding and unkind comments.


Put your foot down and make it clear that your spouse treats you well, treats the kids well, and that that is that as far as you're concerned. Other people's opinions do not matter.
Ask family to keep unkind comments to themselves. Remind them that nobody is perfect.
Realize that your own family has your back. If your spouse were spotted cheating on you by family, they'd soon tell you. It's about the balance of staying out of each other's business unless really needed.
Just look at it this way––they are not the ones that are going to sleep with your spouse at night––you are. Just make sure that things are clear with family, so that later on down the road there are no issues or fall-outs. It's best to do it as an intimate family outing––get to know one another on just a regular day outing, so that if things go wrong, no important memories are ruined.
Life is best when we all get along, the reality (and for some the problem) is that this life is not a fairytale.

, Most people in a relationship forget this important aspect. Throwing each other's dirty laundry about and arguing in public shows a lack of respect. Keep the intimate issues for discussing at home, not airing in public.


It doesn't matter if your husband does not put the lid down, or if he leaves his socks at the door, or if your wife does not help you out around the house. This is not for public airing! Things need to be said to one another, such as if your partner does something that bugs you, tell them when you are at home.
Through talking about your likes and dislikes together, you get to know one another better and learn about backing off instead of pushing one another's buttons.
Learn the cues and obey them. You do this with friends, so do it with your spouse too––have no-go topics and a look or other signal that says back off, this isn't something we're discussing. At least not at that moment.
Be aware that there are things not to discuss in front of family or friends, just as much as in public. Use your signals to warn one another that the line is being crossed if one of you gets uncomfortable. For example, if neither of you wants to discuss your sex life details, say something like: ""A lady/gentleman never reveals. They are intimate secrets and it's not fun to reveal them.""
Be honest. If you don't like something, don't pretend that you do. Sooner or later the truth comes out, it's better to be honest and upfront from the start of not liking it. Not everyone likes the same things and that is what makes a relationship work––learning new things and giving each other the space to be unique.
If you haven't had sex for a long time, get help, such as therapy or marriage counseling.

, Do not nag about hobbies. Most people have more than one. For example, one partner might like to draw, create, and have get together with girlfriends, while the other likes to work on construction. Learn to work around the differences and appreciate them as learning opportunities and as the very things that keep you interesting to one another.


Realize that at times it may feel as if you're seeing your spouse for the first time because they are doing such different things from you. That can be exciting!
Have a bucket list. Keep checking off those things on it to stay engaged and interested in your life.
Your partner is an add-on to who you are, not the person that consumes you and stops you from being your own self. Complete each other and that brings you back to the yin and yang. The yang is all white with a speck of black and the yin is all black with a speck of white. They compete each other they don't overtake the other.

, For a relationship or marriage to work, there needs to be love. That unconditional love that makes your body crave and long for your partner. Or that feeling you get of wanting to cry when they hug you, that without saying it, you know they love you the same or more. Love without expectation, love without judgment and love will come back to you.

,
Make sure that the shoe fits because if it doesn't, it's never going to fit, no matter how much you cry, diet or flinch. Just walk away––it's not your size. It also means that you are not going to be able to handle the baggage, so why suffer.
Don't say what you will regret later. This is important because hurting each other is not love and hate can be created from this. You want a happy, safe haven, not a place you hate to come home to. We get enough hurt from others outside our home and we don't need it from the ones we love.
Family; yes they are important but you need to look out for you and what makes you happy. Family needs to accept that no one person will be perfect, that no matter what all they need is to be there, like they have always been.
Have respect and honesty; this goes for all walks of life––you need to respect so that you can be heard and be honest, so that things don't come back to bite you on the butt.
Hobbies are the thing that separate you from the world and bring you back to who you truly are and they are very therapeutic.
Like who you are, like how your partner likes who you are, and vice versa.
Love unconditionally.;

Start a conversation.,
Get him/her to talk to you.,
Provide empathy.,
Listen, but do not judge.,
Avoid nagging and harsh comments.",How to Help Your Overweight Girlfriend or Boyfriend Be Healthy2," You will want to avoid being too direct or hurtful to your partner. Avoid saying things like: “You know, you’re really fat” or “You really shouldn’t eat that.” Instead, start a general conversation about health.This will be a good way to broach the topic without being too hurtful. Try to say things like:


”Did you hear about the study about weight gain and heart disease?”
”Wow, this article about this new workout looks really fun.”
”Wouldn’t it be neat to go to that dance class? I hear it is really good cardio.”

, Once you have planted a seed in your partner’s mind, she might start to open up to you about her own fears and goals.Be an active listener to her worries or complaints; it is not easy to identify shameful or hurtful things. Encourage your partner to talk to you by responding kindly. Try saying things like:


”I hear you say that you are struggling with your weight. Do you want to talk about it?”
”I agree, having the motivation to work out can be difficult. Do you want to hear what gets me going in the morning?”

, It can sometimes be difficult or daunting to an overweight person to hear a fit person talk about being healthy. Provide empathy to your partner by providing what you have struggled with.


”It took me two years to lose 70lbs. It was so difficult and I wanted to give up all the time.”
”All I wanted to do last night was go home and eat a big bowl of chocolate ice cream. But, I realized that would just make me feel worse.”
”Losing weight is so hard. I kept getting so discouraged by the number on the scale.”

, It is difficult to talk about faults and it can be hurtful to talk to someone you love only to be judged harshly. If your partner is talking to you about a problem, be kind and do not judge. They are reaching out to you because they respect your opinion. Avoid saying things like:


”Yeah, I noticed you were getting chubby.”
”I can’t believe you live like this!”
”Wow, you can eat that?”

, This breeds resentment and your relationship to suffer. Instead, focus on being supportive. Avoid pointing out when your partner fails or struggles. Be encouraging!

Respond to problems proactively.",How to Have a Successful Relationship," Compare your own values to those held by your partner. If these core values differ too drastically, your lifestyles might be too incompatible to work out in the long-term.


Take all major values into consideration, including your faith, social beliefs, and plans for the future. For instance, if you definitely want to have kids but your partner is definitely against it, a successful relationship might be improbable.
You'll also need to compare financial values. Consider the way you and your partner spend money. Once you share your finances, you need to be able to agree on how to spend and save money.;
, Trusting your partner is important, but you should only extend trust to a partner who deserves it. To that end, you should evaluate whether or not your current partner is actually worth trusting.


Consider past experience. Ask yourself if your partner has been dependable and consistently supportive. A partner that has a history of breaking your trust may not be worth trusting anymore.
If your partner has proven his or her trustworthiness but you still have difficulty feeling trust, the issue might lie with you. There might be some unrelated cause making it difficult for you to trust, and you will need to address that issue before you can build a lasting relationship with your partner.

, Different people will naturally draw different sides of your personality to the forefront. It will be much easier to maintain a successful relationship with someone who naturally draws out your positive attributes.


Essentially, you need to ask yourself if you're happy with who you are in the relationship. If this relationship makes you feel insecure, for instance, it might not be healthy to maintain, even if your partner isn't intentionally drawing out that side of you.
If you're unhappy with who you are in the context of the relationship, you might be able to work through your problems with the help of your partner or a professional therapist. You will need to determine whether or not the issue is something that can be resolved on a case by case basis.

, Consider how you and your partner deal with conflicts, both within your relationship and outside of it. While there will always be room for improvement, you at least need some current foundation for healthy conflict resolution if you want the relationship to last.


Successful couples are able to confront problems and resolve them. If you hold grudges with one another, avoid conflict altogether, or shut down emotionally after an argument, you will need to improve the way you deal with conflict if you want the relationship to continue.
Similarly, when external problems arise, you and your partner need to be able to support each other. Drawing together will make your relationship more successful, but being pulled apart is a bad sign.

, Both you and your partner must look at one another as equals. You must both admit that the two of you are equally deserving of love, respect, and devotion. If one partner is less committed than the other, the relationship won't be able to last long.


If you aren't willing to return a favor, don't ask for it. For instance, if you want to spend a night out with your friends, you also need to let your partner spend a night out with his or her own friends.
Divide your shared responsibilities evenly, as well. Split household chores evenly and give each other equal voices when you make decisions that affect both of you.

, You should express your love through both words and actions. Work with your partner to find the right balance for your relationship.Saying ""I love you"" is important, even if you frequently express your love through your actions. Actions speak louder than words, but there are times when words still speak more clearly.
Demonstrate your love through small acts of physical intimacy and appreciation. For instance, hold hands with your partner as you walk down the street or surprise your partner with a small gift to show that you've been thinking of him or her.

, Respect is just as essential as love within a relationship. If the two of you are unable to respect each other as human beings, the bond between you will crumble apart.Accept your partner for who he or she is. Instead of trying to change your partner, accept your partner's weaknesses and focus on your his or her strengths.
You also need to make sure that both you and your partner respect you. Address your partner's needs, but don't prioritize them over your own.

, You'll need to support each other at all times. Encourage each other when things get tough, and congratulate one another when things go well.


Listen to your partner's complaints and interests. Offer advice when you can, but never underestimate the value of a shoulder to cry on, either.
You also need to give your partner the opportunity to support you. Confess your likes, dislikes, fears, and dreams to your partner. Be as open about these things as possible.

, Both emotional intimacy and physical intimacy are important in a relationship. You must feel an emotional connection to your partner that is just as strong as any physical attraction you feel.


Spend time looking nice for one another. You can dress down most of the time, but on occasion, you should put a little extra effort into grooming yourself so your partner realizes how attracted you still are to him or her.
Make sure that your romance is built on a solid friendship. You need to be able to share secrets, laughter, and tears with one another.

, People who possess positive attitudes generally tend to experience more success overall. This is true in nearly all areas of life, and your relationship is not an exception.


Remain thankful for your relationship and try not to take any aspect of it for granted.
Spend time encouraging positivity in the relationship, as well. Try to make positive statements to your partner at least five times as often as you state negative comments.

, To prevent things from feeling stale, the two of you should make it a point to occasionally share new experiences.


Discuss different options you might want to pursue and take your individual personalities into consideration. There are some activities you know your partner won't enjoy even though you might, and vice versa. Avoid these activities when possible and focus on new experiences that might bring equal enjoyment to both of you.

, Even though you and your partner need to act as “one” in some sense, both of you are still your own individual persons. Nourish yourself as an individual so that you can be energized enough to nourish your relationship, as well.


Spend time alone doing activities or hobbies your partner doesn't enjoy. Spend quiet time alone, too, and focus on meditating or relaxing.
Stay connected to your own friends and family. It's great if your partner gets along with all of your other loved ones, but having your own social circle can be a good thing, too., Two people in a relationship will always face disagreements, but some of these troubles are more serious than others. Fight the important battles and consider letting the insignificant ones drop.Ask yourself if the current disagreement has long-standing consequences. If it doesn't, it might be something worth dropping. If it does, you probably need to address it.

, You should always communicate sincerely, but effective communication is especially important in the midst of an argument or other disagreement.


Nobody can read minds. Instead of making your partner guess, directly state what it is that you need or want from your partner. You can only reach a solution once everything is out in the open.

, Try putting yourself in your partner's shoes and thinking about his or her needs. When you learn to empathize with your partner's feelings, you may find yourself less angry and more willing to accommodate your partner's point of view.


Everyone has shortcomings. Instead of viewing your partner's quirks as weaknesses, accept that these issues are simply part of your partner as a whole.
Many flaws are connected to insecurities, so picking at them during an argument will usually be destructive. Aim for constructive conversation and criticism instead.

, Give a little and take a little. Instead of thinking that the resolution of a disagreement must strictly match either your own ideals or your partner's ideals, try to reach an agreement that satisfies both of your perspectives.


For example, if you get into an argument about how you spend your date nights, figure out a way to include an activity your partner enjoys as well as one that you enjoy. When this won't work, agree to let your partner plan the activity for one date night under the condition that you get to plan the activity for your next date night.

, When a problem arises in your relationship, think of ways to actively correct it instead of dwelling on the problem itself.For example, if the two of you don't spend any time together anymore, start scheduling time for your relationship. Plan dinner dates or look for activities that both of you might enjoy doing. Make a conscious effort to correct the problem instead of letting it fester.

Gauge the level of interest.,
Wait for the right time and place.,
Check your hands.,
Take his hand.,
Start simple.,
Make eye contact.,
Touch them first.,
Give subtle hints.,
Be bold.,
Intensify the hold.",How to Hold Hands," If you're out on a date, look for subtle signs that he might be ready for you to hold his hand. If your date has been giving you the cold shoulder all night, this is a sure sign that he is not interested. But if he has been walking close to you and seems comfortable, this is a good signal for initiating hand holding.


If your date has found little ways to initiate gentle physical contact, like playfully pushing you or grabbing your arm, he is more than likely open to holding hands.;
, If you are in the middle of dinner or are doing an activity that requires you to move a lot, holding hands will not be very convenient.You don't want to hold hands for the first time when both of you are in a large group of friends or at a family gathering. The two of you don't necessarily have to be alone, but make sure it is a private place where both of you are comfortable.


Try taking a walk on the beach, going for a hike, or taking a stroll down the street. You may have people around you, but strangers will most likely not pay attention to the two of you, giving you the privacy you need.
A movie theater is a great place to initiate hand holding. Since you are sitting right next to each other, your positions are very conducive to holding hands. The darkness adds a layer of privacy and may help if your date is shy., You might be a little nervous, so check your hands to make sure they are not sweaty or clammy. If they are, subtly wipe them off or stick them in your pockets for a moment to dry them off. Your date may be nervous too, but sweaty palms are not very appealing.Also make sure your hands are clean and moisturized. Super dry hands or hands that smell are an even bigger turn off than sweaty hands., When you've found the right time and place and you feel ready, walk close to your date and gently take his hand. Remember to be gentle and not to rush it. Make it as subtle as possible and remember to keep talking or walking to ensure it is natural and comfortable.


Make sure you don't lurch forward and scare your date trying to take his hand. You don't want to give off the wrong impression at this early stage in your relationship.
You can also try gently rubbing your hands down your date's arm before you link your hands. This gives him a heads up before you grab his hand and adds a nice, more intimate touch to your initial hand holding.If your date pulls away, don't force the issue. It may be that he isn't interested, but he may also just be shy and is not quite ready to hold hands. Don't take it personally and try to make him feel comfortable in the situation. You'll get there eventually., Use the simple hand grasp technique at first. When you grab his hand, reach across his hand to where your palms are centered, making an X with your hands. Gently close your hand, wrapping your fingers and thumb around the edges of your date's hand.


For the more intimate moment, consider gently rubbing your thumb across the back of his hand. This adds a layer of affection to your grasp and it lets him know you are enjoying the activity without you having to tell him. If he returns the gesture, you know you're doing it right.Try not to hold too tight. This can be uncomfortable and cause both of your hands to sweat.

, If you want to get your date to hold your hand, start simple by making eye contact with him, smiling subtly. This lets him know you are interested in him and makes you seem open and receptive to physical contact.


You can also try walking closer to him while you are walking. They physical proximity, added with the eye contact, will make you seem interested and responsive to his presence.

, Opening up the possibility of physical contact is important. Let your fingers brush at dinner or when you're walking from the car. If you are walking side by side, gently hold his arm or link your arms together. These are gentler forms of contact that let your date know that you are okay with touching.


You can do a kind of hand holding test run by grabbing your date's hand and leading him somewhere, dropping it when you've reached your destination. This way, you hold hands for a short while but it isn't as nerve-racking as officially holding hands., Your date might need some clues that you want your hand held. Try giving him small hints that you want to hold hands. Your date might just be nervous, so encouraging him is always helpful.


If you're in a theater, place your arm and hand on the armrest, palm facing up in invitation. You can also let your hand drop over to his side on the armrest. Your date should take notice and get the hint that you want it held.
Claim your hands are cold. Tell him that your hands are cold or ask him to feel if they are. Hopefully, your date will see if he can help warm them up. This is a cute, flirtatious way to get your date to hold your hand.
Ask if you can compare your hand sizes. Bring your hand up in the air and when your date raises theirs, gently place your palms together, comparing the sizes. This gets your date's hand close to yours and is a subtle way to let him know you want to hold his hand., If for some reason your date has still not figured out that you want to hold hands, initiate contact yourself. Gently clasp his hand and squeeze it gently, letting him know you care. If you are nervous, it is likely that your date is as well. This may help both of you relax.


Confidence and initiative are attractive qualities, so being the first to grab your date's hand lets him know that you are interested in them and that you want to become closer., Once you and your date have gotten comfortable holding hands, try taking the initiative this time and use a different, more intimate hand holding method. If you are clasping hands, open your fingers and move them until they are aligned with your date's fingers. Open your fingers slightly, pushing each of your fingers into the space between your date's fingers, interlocking your fingers."

Figure out when your girlfriend's birthday is.,
Figure out what to get her.,
Think about the stuff she likes.,
Make the gift yourself.,
Take her on a memorable date.,
Don't forget the card!,
Wrap the present neatly.,
Give her the present.",How to Get Your Girlfriend a Great Birthday Present," If you don't remember the exact date, just ask! It would be really embarrassing to get the date wrong. Once you know the date, write it down in your calendar so you don't miss it next year.

, First you should ask her, but don't be surprised if she acts like she doesn't want anything. She does not mean nothing. You should plan to get her something, or at least spend some time with her.


If you don't want to ask directly, pretend you already have the present and ask her to guess what it is. Chances are, the items she guesses are things she wants, and will give you some ideas.

, If she says she wants something specifically, get it for her. If it's too expensive, get her something totally different. For example, if she says she wants a certain kind of perfume, but it is too expensive for you, don't get her a different kind of perfume. Get her something like a necklace, instead.

, Making a present shows that you care enough to spend time and effort. Either way, consider the following:


Get her a framed picture of you two. For bonus points, make or decorate the frame.
Write a list of the reasons you love/like her. She will just DIE of happiness if you do this. Make sure the list is sincere and meaningful. It must be at least 10 reasons why. Hand write it, even if you have really bad handwriting. She will keep it forever! A handwritten love letter is an excellent choice, too.
Some girls love flowers. If she has a green thumb, get her a potted plant so she can take care of it.
Try jewelry. This includes a necklace, bracelet, or pair of earrings. Do not get her a ring unless you're planning to propose. Also, stick to the basic silver or gold (anything more colorful just screams middle school). It doesn't have to be expensive, just meaningful. Try Claire's for jewelry under $20, or look at your local art and wine festival for an artistic selection. If you're handy, search the wikiHow category on jewelry for pieces you can make yourself.
Get her a joke gift. For example, if you two have an inside joke about monkeys, get her a stuffed monkey, or make her a sock monkey.
Get her a sweatshirt or tee shirt from a memorable place you two went. For example, if you went to an Angels game, get her an Angels sweatshirt. If you haven't yet been somewhere memorable together, take her somewhere special and make that part of the gift.
If you have awhile until your girlfriend's birthday, make her a scrapbook of the places you two have gone. Include pictures, ticket stubs, etc. Note that this takes a lot of time to be really good, so if you're only thinking of it the night before, save this thought for next year.
Get her a book or journal. Write something on the inside front cover to give it a personal touch. Help her keep a journal of your relationship if it seems appropriate to do so.
Get her her favorite candy.

, A birthday gift doesn't have to be a physical object. Just do something different than how you normally hang out. Go to a sit-down restaurant. If that is too expensive, make her a romantic picnic with candles and flowers. Don't forget beaches, nature, museums, landmarks, the theater, and concerts, if she likes any of those things.

, Make her a card, even if you are a bad artist. She will think your stick figures are cute! If you buy a card, make sure to hand write something personal on the inside.

, If you can't wrap presents, find someone who can.

, She will love it, just because it's from you.

It can take a while to meet people, let alone meet the right people for starting a long term relationship with, so try to take it slowly at first and let things progress at their own pace. This will work differently for every relationship, so work at your own pace.


It's not usually a good idea to discuss things like marriage and children right off the bat when you meet someone you're interested in. For some people, especially older couples, this can work out fine, it's not always the best way to get to know someone.
Your goal for the first days, weeks, and months of a relationship shouldn't be settling down, it should be getting to know the person, the real person, that you're seeing. This allows you to determine if you want to settle down with this particular person or if you should look elsewhere--if your goal is to settle down rather than getting to know them, you might compromise on important beliefs or sell yourself short all in the name of having a long-term relationship. For this reason, it's usually best to keep long-term conversations out of it, at least for a couple of months.
Introduce your partner to your friends and your family after a couple of months and wait until later to ask what they think about the person you're seeing. If everyone goes on and on about how happy you seem together, how good you seem to be for each other, and other compliments, take it as a good sign.;
, It's true that love is often blind, and it can make us ignore obvious faults in potential long-term partners, things that your friends and family might be able to pick up on more easily. It can be helpful to get a second opinion from trusted friends and loved ones whom you trust.


Remember, it's still your relationship, and these decisions are ultimately up to you. If your friends don't like your partner, that doesn't necessarily mean more than that they're incompatible, as long as you're happy together., If you're with someone and are thinking about committing to a long term relationship, it's important that you first discuss whether or not your partner is interested in one, and get all the cards out on the table. There are lots of different types of relationships, expectations about what a relationship means, and ideas about commitment, and the best way to learn how your partner feels is to ask.


Ask your partner a simple probing question, like ""How far do you see this relationship going?"" Be prepared for all variety of answers.What does ""long term"" mean to you? A couple of months? Until the first fight? Or marriage? Kids?
Think about scenarios that will help you consider your commitment. What if your partner got a job on the opposite coast? Would you want to move? Under what circumstances would you want to break up?

, What do you want out of your life? Where do you want to be in ten years? What kind of a career do you envision for yourself? These kinds of things can get in the way of long-term relationships, or can at least make your compatibility with someone more challenging.


Recognize incompatibility when it arises. If you want to travel extensively in the next couple years and your partner doesn't, that's something you'll need to talk about. Relationships that manipulate you into doing things that you don't want to do are not healthy.
There's a difference between being ready for a long term relationship and being ready for a long term relationship with this person. A lot of times, settling down sounds nice, secure, and attractive, but is it right with this person? Right now? That's something to think about and talk about with your partner.

, One good, quick way to find out whether or not your relationship has the potential to succeed is in going on a trip together. Trips can be stressful, and will force you to spend lots of time together at once, so it can be a nice way to see whether or not your relationship will stand up to the stress of it. You'll see your partner at their worst, probably. Will you still like them afterward?It doesn't have to be a big expensive trip abroad to tell you what you need to learn. Just plan a weekend trip camping to see how it goes, or go on a short weekend road trip to visit some family.

, If you think your partner might be ""the one,"" it can be good for a lot of couples to try living together for a while before they commit to marriage, or to a more long-term arrangement. Like going on a trip together, living together helps you to see what your partner is like when they're tired, grumpy, hungover, and other low points. If you can still love your partner when they've got the flu or a stomach bug, you've got something really special.


Alternatively, for some couples keeping separate spaces is one of the secrets to long-term success. It's true that it's important to have your own space. Nowhere does it say that living together is a requirement of a good relationship.

, Some couples make the mistake of thinking that having a child together can help to revive a failing relationship. This is a serious mistake. And likewise, just because you may be ready to have a child yourself doesn't necessarily mean that it's right for you to have a child with this person at this time. Want to find out how you'll parent with a potential partner? Try getting a pet that requires ""co-parenting"" first.


Even something as small and as low-commitment as a bird, hamster, or rabbit can help you to see your partner's level of commitment to another life and another member of your twosome. Are they willing to compromise and love, selflessly?
Keep your current living situation in mind! In some cases, getting a pet together if you're not in a stable enough environment can be irresponsible and foolish. Don't get a pet unless you have the time and resources to devote to it.

, If, after putting your relationship to the test, you think that you've got a keeper on your hands, it might be time to commit to something serious. When you're ready, let your partner know that you're committed to the relationship and that you're willing to work on it and to try your best to keep it healthy. Every relationship will be different, so talk with your partner.


Commitment may be as simple as being open about an ""exclusive"" arrangement, or as serious as getting engaged, depending on what you've discussed with your partner. But committing and choosing to work on your relationship, to make compromises to serve that relationship, is an important step.
Generally, it's expected that a long-term relationship means that you're not seeing other people, though this is by no means true of all relationships. Don't take anything for granted. Check with your partner.

, One of the most important parts of a long-term relationship has to do with honesty. If you're going to commit, you owe your partner honesty, at the least, in terms of your desires for the relationship and your happiness. If you're frustrated about something, share, and listen in return.


The other side of the honesty coin is being a good listener. You need to be there for your partner and be willing to listen to them open up. Make yourself available.
Again, what ""honesty"" means will be different for every couple. Is it absolutely necessary for you to divulge the gritty details of your past to every partner, if you think it might jeopardize your relationship? Only you can answer that question. If it's keeping you from happiness, tell. If not, consider keeping it quiet.

, One of the difference between short flings and long term relationships is how you negotiate fights with your partner. A fight doesn't necessarily mean that a relationship is over. It just means that you've come up against something that you're either going to work through, or come to terms with as a potential roadblock to your happiness with this person. Either way, fights are important to deal with and get past.


Address problems as soon as they arise. The worst thing that can happen is ignoring warning signs when they arise to try to keep your relationship at an even keel. It's important to confront things sooner rather than later.
It's important to recognize the difference between common little arguments that you can work through and serious problems that you can't. If you have a tendency to fight about the dishes, that's one thing, but if your partner constantly criticizes you, or makes you feel inferior after a conversation about dishes, that's something else.

, It's a common joke: your friend gets a long term partner, and then you never see them again. The longer a relationship gets, the harder it can be to make time for socializing in addition to the work necessary to maintain your relationship. To make it easier on yourself, try to do both at the same time. Make friends together and socialize as a couple.


It's important to avoid situations in which you only spend time with your partner's friendship group. If your partner has lots of friends, that's great, but make new friends together. If you break up, it's tough to feel like you lost all your friends as well.
Try finding couples that you enjoy hanging out with, as well as single friends whom you enjoy the company of., If you've discovered that your life goals line up with your partner, start setting mutual goals for yourselves and for your relationship. What is your ultimate ambition for your relationship and for yourself? Where do you hope to be next year? Where do you hope to be in the next five years? Figure out what you need to be doing to grow your relationship and your life together.


In the early stages, this might mean things like saving money together, finishing school, securing a career, and other steps to get yourself ready for settling down more comfortably.
In later stages, this might mean things like marriage and kids, starting to invest your money, and other family-oriented goals.

, Sounds obvious, right? It's good to remember that if you love your partner, you need to say so every now and then. It's very important that a burgeoning long-term relationship be built on love and trust, and you need to let both your actions and your words communicate that. Say those three words and say them often.

, While it might seem easy, it's important for couples in long term relationships to make that relationship a priority, taking time out of your schedule with friends and family to do things with your partner. The longer your relationship gets, the more difficult this can become. Make the effort.


You don't have to do expensive or things or go on exotic dates to keep your relationship fresh. Going out to dinner and movies is nice, but it's also great to go hiking together, or give each other massages, or spend a night gaming together. Time spent being active together is good.
While it might seem unromantic, it can sometimes be necessary to schedule time to do things with your partner in a long term relationship to remain intimate with one another, and keep your emotional connection alive. Schedule weekly date nights, or monthly weekends away.

, Savage Love columnist and author Dan Savage coined the term ""GGG"" to refer to a quality in partners common to good long-term relationships: the trait of being ""good, giving, and game.""


Being good means acting in a way that has your partner's best interest at heart. You have to be good to your partner at all times.
Being giving means going the extra mile to make your partner happy. Give a part of yourself to your partner, sharing your interests and your life with them. Be selfless when you're with your partner.
Being game means being up for things you might normally not be excited about. It's easy to be a stick in the mud about things you're inexperienced or uninterested in, but if it would make your partner happy, try to be up for it. Could be fun.

, It's easy for long-term relationships to become predictable very quickly. You go to work or school, you come home, you see the same friends, you go the same places, you watch the same shows. It can get boring, and that boredom can sour you on the relationship. Make the effort to keep things spontaneous.


You might already know each other well, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep going on dates. Make the time to go out and have fun with each other. Keep your relationship fun and special.
Surprise your partner every now and then by making special plans without them knowing. Even things as simple as cooking dinner or cleaning up the kitchen without being asked can score some points. It's little things that make the difference.

, As important as it is to keep your relationship active and alive, it's also important to spend time independent of your partner, hanging out with your own friends and indulging your own interests. Not everything needs to involve your partner.Have your own space, especially if you live together. Even if it's just your own desk or night stand, it's important to keep a little space for yourself.
Have your own friends and make plans with them independently. If your partner doesn't like you to hang out with your own friends periodically, that's a problem that needs to be discussed. Both partners deserve to have their own friends and spend time with them.

By asking them meaningful, important questions, you will not only show them you care enough to learn more about them and their thoughts, but you will also be working on strengthening your relationship.Some other questions you might consider are: what traits do you value most in a partner? When was the last time you felt really disappointed? Where do you see yourself in five or ten years? What’s something that always makes you happy?

, It’s important to talk about your everyday lives with one another, but it’s also important to go deeper than that in your conversations. Try to set aside time each day to have a real, meaningful conversation with your partner. Maybe there is something on your mind that you need to discuss, or maybe your partner has been under some stress at work and might want to unload. Keep that space open for real conversation, and make it a point to engage with one another on that level as often as possible.Try talking about your feelings, either for one another or in general. Having emotional discussions can lead to a sense of vulnerability and trust, which can bring you closer together.

, Use text messages or sticky notes to leave one another little love notes now and then. Randomly letting your partner know you care can make them feel special and important. Love notes are a simple, sweet way to remind your partner of your feelings for them.No matter how much time goes by in a relationship, it’s important not to let one another forget how you feel for each other. Losing sight of the feelings that made you fall for each other in the first place can sometimes make you feel distant.

, Despite myths that couples’ therapy is ineffective, it can actually be a great tool for strengthening your relationship. Find a provider in your area, or through your insurance network if you’re covered. However, make sure you have a serious discussion about seeking therapy beforehand, and that both of you are on board.Take some time to discuss what you would both like in a therapist as well. For example, do you feel more comfortable with a man or a woman? Do you want to do sessions together or separately? Make a list of what you both want.

, As partners, you probably have at least a few things that you both worry about or get joy from. Whether it’s parenting, work, extended families, or finances, there are probably things you could spend time discussing together. Having someone to share in those emotions with you is a great way to feel closer by sharing a common ground.You don’t need to worry, or even be happy, alone. Your partner is there to go through those things with you. Try your best not to distance yourself from them. Instead, work to include them.

Consider whether you might have given your boyfriend cause to feel overwhelmed.,
See things from his perspective.,
Give things a bit of a break.,
Don't let it get to your head.,
Be up front.,
Reach out to him on his level.,
Make an effort to go out on a date.,
Demand respect.,
Give him a little bit of the cold shoulder.,
If you feel like he's cheating on you, end it.",How to Get Your Boyfriend to Stop Ignoring You," It may be that he has retreated just to gain some space if you've been too intrusive or intense of late. Maybe you're texting him often, or you've been calling three times an hour for the past three hours. Understand that guys generally appreciate their space and not having to be with you 24/7.;
, There are a lot of very authentic reasons that might seem as if he is ""ignoring"" you, but actually, have nothing to do with you.


He may be busy. You may have the habit of talking daily, then suddenly it stops, and you urgently want to chat. It has been a day, but you're frantic. And he, well he is very busy! When he's busy, you can expect him to cut off the communications until the task is done.
He doesn't feel well. He has been trying to deal with a head cold, a shoulder pain or a stomach ache. Being the stoic that he is, he has only stopped replying because he doesn't want to burden you with his pain or let on that he doesn't even feel so great.
He is tired. Genuinely, pooped. He just wants a bit of space to recover his lost energy, so he's withdrawing for a week of snooze catch-up.
He has experienced a family issue. He is uncomfortable talking to you about it because he has issues with his crazy/possessive/insane/angry/moralizing/whatever family and it's just all too hard to go into the gritty details. He'd rather you didn't get involved because once you are, awful entanglements will ensue. This can be a very protective stance, both ways.
He has hit a snag at work. The deadline is looming, the boss is breathing down his neck, the job's future is precarious. He's salvaging what is left of his work opportunity, and you are suddenly a distraction.

, If you think that you might have been a bit too ""full on"", try pulling back for a while and giving him back the space that you've tried to inhabit. This doesn't mean withdrawing affection or not seeing him at all; it just means learning to pace yourself and take it easy.


Don't text or call him for an entire day. Try to stick with it. If he hasn't reached out to you at all during that day, talk with him about what he expects out of a relationship. If you expect something that he won't give you, you may want to look elsewhere for a boyfriend.
Don't text or call him about pointless things. Don't call him just because Mindy broke up with Seth when your boyfriend doesn't know either of those people. You may think it's important, but he probably doesn't.

, Getting sad and emotional about it just lowers your appeal and may be the goal of some chauvinistic men. Be happy and smile more. Your days will not be hindered by the fact that he is ignoring you. The happier you are, the more he'll want to feed off that happiness.

, Ask him if he's ignoring you for any particular reason. Did you bother him? Did you accidentally say something? If he's acting strangely for a particular reason, you'll want to know why so that you don't risk doing it again.


If he tells you he just needs more space, figure out if you can live with that. If you're the kind of person who wants a complete partnership with your boyfriend, and that sort of space is going to be hard for you to deal with, things might not work out.

, As noted earlier, there can be any number of reasons why your boyfriend might be ignoring you. However, it's possible that he isn't answering because he doesn't think that the things you say are important; he sees your nattering as idle chatter, stuff that doesn't earn a reply or lead to a discussion. Learn to talk to him on his level, and he'll be interested in no time; or, leave the celebrity gossip and hair and nails stuff for the girls.


Talk to him about his passions. Maybe it's sports; maybe it's racing, maybe it's chemistry. It could be anything. Talk about what he likes to do and be excited about his passions. Every boy has a passion; you just have to find it.
Ask him questions about the things he likes. Ask him why he likes what he likes. Ask him to explain his favorite hobby, and how he first got interested in it. If you're excited about something he's excited about, he won't be able to ignore you.
Don't interrupt him when he's on a roll. When he's all excited about something, let him keep talking. Don't interrupt when he's got momentum.

, Tell him that you want to go on a date, and hopefully, he'll get the hint that you want him to set it up. If he doesn't get the hint, then you might have to figure it out yourself. It'll be a small price to pay if the date goes well.


Remember to do something that he enjoys. Shopping might be something you'd do all day long if you had the chance, but it's probably not his idea of a great date. See if you can go to an amusement park, the movies, a performance of a band he likes, etc.
Dress your best, put a smile on your face, and wear your hair just the way he likes it. Sometimes, all a guy will need is a little wake-up call that his girl is the prettiest girl on the block. That should shake his funk up.
Try to focus on good stuff during the date. Keep him engaged. Ask him questions. Be playful, warm-hearted, and optimistic. Give him a chance to make everything better, and remind him of why he's your boyfriend in the first place.
If the date doesn't go well, tell him that you hoped the date would be an opportunity to connect and that you worry you just aren't connecting in the way you used to. If he still doesn't seem to care, he doesn't deserve another shot.

, If he thinks he can get away with ignoring you after your attempts to turn things around, and you let him, then he is getting away with ignoring you. If you demand respect from him, telling him what you will and won't stand for, he won't have any other option.


Tell him how you feel. Tell him you need better communication, and that you'll try to communicate better too. Tell him if the communication doesn't get better, you might have to consider calling it quits.
If he loves you and respects you, he'll change in an instant. If he doesn't love you and doesn't respect you, why would you want to be with him?

, Go hang out with your friends and guy friends. Make sure he understands that you have a life, too and that he's lucky you're including him in it.


Most guys will immediately come running back and stop ignoring you, especially if you're hanging out with other guys. They'll get territorial. It's just how guys work.
If he doesn't come back to you and keeps ignoring you, ask yourself if you want the relationship you're getting. One hundred percent effort from someone else is probably better than 50 percent effort from him.

, Of course, it helps to have proof: You don't want to break up with him just because you have a ""feeling."" But if stuff doesn't feel right, have a talk and figure out what's wrong. If nothing is wrong, and that's just how things are, then you probably want to start looking for a new boyfriend, because things just aren't working for you two.

Recreate memorable dates.,
Try a new activity together.,
Make time each day to be together.,
Do simple daily activities together.,
Find some interesting activities that you can share.,
Surprise your partner sometimes.",How to Grow Closer to Each Other2," If you have been together for a while, you probably had a few really great or memorable dates early on in your relationship. Your first date, for example, probably holds an important spot in your memories. Recreate those moments—go to the same restaurant, watch the same movie, or take a walk down the same street that you did on that memorable night. Reliving those moments with one another will remind you both of what brought and kept you together.You could also bring back things you used to do early on in the relationship. For example, if you used to call each other a certain pet name, or had an inside joke, bring those things back to keep that spark alive and feel closer to each other.

, As great as those old memories are, it’s still important to make new ones. Try new things together. Pick things that are new to both of you, so you will both be experiencing it for the first time together. For example, you might try a pottery class if neither of you has ever tried one before. It could be a fun, lighthearted way to enjoy time together and learn something new side-by-side.If classes aren’t really your thing, you could simply try a new cuisine at a new restaurant, or watch a movie neither of you has seen. Read a book together and discuss it every few chapters. Go to a concert for an artist neither of you has heard of before.

, It’s easy to get busy and feel too caught up in your own day-to-day activities to spend time with your partner. Make time each day, or at least every few days, to spend focusing on one another. This could be the time when you have important conversations, go on a date, or simply spend quiet time alone together.During this special time together, consider putting aside things like smartphones, tablets, and other electronics. Focus entirely on your partner rather than the distractions that come with the digital world., Having coffee in the morning, cooking a meal together, waking up with each other, or working on assignments for work or school with each other are all ways to be closer to each other while still going about your everyday lives. As students, full-time employees, and/or parents, those seemingly mundane activities are easily made into quality time when done with your partner.Making your partner a part of your everyday life will probably help you grow your bond and feel closer to one another, all without making significant changes to how you already do things.

, Doing interesting activities together can help to bring you and your significant other closer together by giving you a shared experience. This will also give you more to talk about. Try doing something together that you both enjoy, such as:

Taking a tour at an art museum.
Reading the same book.
Watching a documentary together.
Taking a class together.

, You don’t have to do anything especially elaborate to surprise your partner—just a simple gesture to boost their mood and show them they matter to you. For example, you might meet them at their work for lunch out of the blue, with flowers or a picnic. You could even draw them a bath to have ready when they get home, leave them a sweet note in their purse or wallet, or bring them breakfast in bed."

Be affectionate.,
Make time for intimacy.,
Respect your partner.,
Seek the help of a sex therapist.,
Give it time.",How to Grow Closer to Each Other3," Holding hands, putting your arm around your partner while walking, or even just sitting beside one another are all ways to show affection without being overly physical. Affection doesn’t necessarily have to be sexual in nature. Simple displays of affection and making sure to touch one another often are great ways to bring you closer.Try watching a movie together while cuddling on the couch. Even simply cuddling and being physically close to each other can make you feel closer on an emotional level.

, If you’re parents, or work often, you might find that your time and energy for intimacy are often limited. It’s not a bad thing to set aside time to be physically intimate with one another. However, it’s still important to be spontaneous and passionate now and then just to keep things interesting!If you don’t want to “schedule” your intimacy, just focus on making it a priority that you both can keep.

, While physical intimacy is important, it’s important to talk things out with your partner and respect their needs and desires. For example, before you push more frequent physical intimacy on them, have a discussion about it. Ask them if they think you both could benefit from being physically closer. Ask them how they think you should go about being more affectionate with one another, and what they’d be comfortable with. Not only will you be respecting them and their boundaries, you’ll also be having meaningful discussions about your relationship.It’s important to respect your partner’s feelings, as well. If they happen to be dealing with something in their lives and are having a hard time, for example, it might not be the best time to bring up physical intimacy. Reassure them that you are there for them, regardless of your physical relationship.

, If you are having trouble with physical intimacy that you can’t seem to get past on your own, it might be a good idea to talk to a therapist who specializes in helping couples overcome these kinds of struggles. Problems with sexual intimacy often stem from emotional issues you’re facing in your relationship—such as feeling too distant from one another. A sex therapist would be able to help you address these issues and work them out., Things won’t heal or strengthen themselves overnight. Even if you start working on your relationship and taking the steps towards growing closer, it will still take time and effort to really see the result you want. Taking it slow in relationships, no matter how long you’ve been together, can help strengthen them in the long run.Don’t push or force the issue, especially when it comes to physical intimacy. Be patient and be prepared to put in the time and effort until both of you are comfortable.

Prioritize respect.There’s a saying that “love is all you need”, but along with that, everyone needs respect.,
Evaluate your partner.,
Reflect on your values.,
Remember that sex doesn’t equate to love.,
Assess compatibility.,
Write down things you want to talk about.,
Talk openly.,
Express your feelings.,
Say what you need.,
Ask your partner to hear you out.,
Set boundaries.,
Agree to make changes.,
Let go of resentment.,
Define reasonable expectations for the relationship.,
Decide if this is the relationship for you.",How to Get Your Significant Other to Treat You Right," If there’s no respect, is there love? Often, respect is a two-way street; if it’s not given, it’s not received. Be sure to treat your partner with respect just as much as you want him or her to respect you.


Most importantly, have respect for yourself. Treat yourself with respect and dignity. Don’t be in a relationship just because you’re lonely, and don’t let your partner walk all over you. For more information on how to respect yourself, check out How to Respect Yourself.;
, It’s easy to get caught up in feelings, but it’s also important to think about your partner in terms of what kind of person he or she is. What are your partner’s values and personality traits?Think about how these things affect you and your relationship.


If your partner treats friends and family in a way you dislike, it’s likely that you and your partner have different values in how to treat others. It may be difficult to come to an agreement on how to treat each other in a way that feels good to both of you.

, Think about what you value in a partner, or what you consider your “non-negotiables”. If you value having a very mutual relationship yet the current one seems off balance, ask yourself if that’s something you can compromise on or not.


Think of all the values you have in a partner and in a relationship, then compare them with your reality right now. What are you willing to compromise with, and what are not unwilling to put up with?
It’s unlikely you will meet someone who meets all of your “criterias”, so be willing to compromise in certain areas.Remember it’s up to you where you choose to compromise.

, Especially at the beginning of a relationship, it’s easy to mistake attraction and physical intimacy for love.It’s important to make the distinction between sex and love.


Ask yourself about what the relationship fulfills for you, and what it fulfills for your partner.

, Make sure that you and your significant other are on the same page; if one of you thinks the relationship is casual and the other views it as serious, it’s likely you will treat each other differently and find unhappiness soon along the way. You may treat each other differently or expect treatment from the other based on your own expectations.Be clear on your intentions in the relationship with each other.


If you are unclear about nature of the relationship, or you are unclear about how your partner’s feels, talk about it.

, You might feel overwhelmed with anger or frustration. Before charging your significant other, take some time to write down your concerns. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you clarify what is important, what you want to say, and how you want to say it.


If you’re upset with your significant other, write down some examples of the behaviors that you are not comfortable with. Make sure that you have a clear understanding of the issues you would like to address and how you want to address them.

, Be open and honest about what’s going on, yet do so gently. Your partner may feel defensive if he or she perceives a negative evaluation or judgment, so make sure you go in with an open heart. If you can't think of anything good to say, you may want to think over the choice to stay with your partner.


Communicate openly and be kind in your interactions.Instead of attacking your partner or putting him or her on the defensive, say something that shows you appreciate your partner or give a compliment first. From there, you can steer the conversation into things that each of you can change.

, Keep in mind that if you are feeling something, your feelings are valid. Even if your feelings are misinformed or from a misunderstanding, it’s okay to have feelings and express them. Do not allow this person to minimize your feelings.


To avoid blaming your partner, use “I” statements.For instance, instead of saying, “You ignore me all the time,” say, “I feel really hurt when you’re emotionally distant from me. It feels like you don’t want to be around me.”

, Communicate what you need from your partner and from the relationship. It’s okay to have preferences and it’s okay to express them with your significant other.If you hold back your needs for fear of starting an argument, ask yourself if this is helping you. Are you able to let it go, or is it building resentment as you continually shy away from discussing it?


If your significant other’s lateness really bothers you and it makes you feel disrespected, bring this up with him. Instead of blaming him, put the emphasis on how it makes you feel. Say, “It really bothers me when you’re late all the time. It makes me feel like you don’t value my time. I would like it if you put more effort into being on time, please.”

, If you want to say everything and not be interrupted, say this to your significant other. It’s easy for other people to interrupt you or want to defend the words or actions, but ask if you can finish. If you sense that your partner is not receptive, you may want to have the conversation at a later time.


Say, “I want to hear what you say, but right now I would like to talk and have you listen. Then we can switch roles.”

, Boundaries allow you to interact respectfully and maintain appropriate limits. Boundaries also help in not making assumptions.If you assume your partner shares your feelings and thoughts, you can end up in a lot of trouble and misunderstanding. You can set a boundary for your significant other not to use profane or derogatory language directed toward you, or to not talk bad about your family.


Setting time boundaries can also be helpful. For instance, you may start a serious discussion then realize you need to leave to pick up your sister. Say, “I want to hear what you have to say, and I can give you all of my attention in 5 minutes.” Or say, ”If you put and rinse all of the dishes in the sink by 8pm, I’m happy to wash them.”

, Relationships work best when both people agree to make changes and cooperate.Together, decide what changes need to occur, then find ways to make them happen. Don’t expect that things will change without any effort; come up with a plan that will help you and your partner stick to the changes.


Take up the mindset that relationships can benefit personal expansion, and that making compromises and changes that benefit each person helps you grow and meet the needs of both yourself and your partner., If you’re holding onto something your significant other did, let it go.It’s ultimately your choice to let it go or leave the relationship; it’s not fair to you to feel bad about what happened, and it’s not fair to him or her to have that hanging over the head until you work it through. If you feel like you deserve special treatment because of a mess up your significant other did, it’s really up to you to let it go or not.


Yes, it feels awful if your significant other cheats on you or hurts you in another way. But think about how you’re treating him now after the event. Are you treating him in a loving and respectful way? If you cannot treat him respectfully now, you may want to consider if the relationship is worth it.

, Once you’ve stated your concerns and your thoughts and feelings, you may come to find that you and your significant other see things differently. Your ideas of treating someone well in a relationship may be different than your partner's, and you will have to find a compromise. Have a conversation about your expectations, and how you can meet and compromise on these important factors.


If you’re both invested in the relationship, then it’s imperative that you find compromise and cooperation on these sensitive topics.For instance, if you disagree on how much time you spend with in-laws, agree that you will go to family functions every other time, while your partner can choose to go to every one.

, If you chronically feel let down, disrespected, or treated unfairly, reconsider whether this is a good relationship for you. Think about why you hold on, despite feeling like things are unbalanced. Be honest with yourself and spend some time thinking about what is best for you.


Remember that you can’t change someone. If you find yourself waiting around for your significant other to change or you find yourself making excuses for him or her, this may be an indication that this isn’t the best option for you.

Break the touch barrier.,
Hold his arm.,
Use the right body language.,
Make your hand available.,
Do a pressure test.",How to Get Your Boyfriend to Hold Hands with You Again1," When you are with your boyfriend, try to touch him more than you normally do. This will help make him more comfortable with touching you and he will feel more confident about holding your hand if he is nervous.Try touching his arm when you laugh at his jokes. Or you could give him a shoulder massage if you think he looks tense. You can even try giving him a high five just to start breaking the touch barrier.
This kind of touching is appropriate when you are hanging out with your boyfriend socially. You might not want to try this much at school, at church, or in front of your parents.
Be careful not to touch him too much or he may become uncomfortable.;
, This is a great way to initiate touch and let your boyfriend know that you want him to return the touch. Just reach over and link your arm through his when you are walking or sitting next to each other.This kind of action is appropriate when the two of you are alone. But try to remember to let go of his arm if another person approaches you – especially one of his friends – because it might make it seem like you want to be alone.

, Much of what we communicate isn’t spoken with words alone. Body language is very important in letting someone know what we think or feel. Show your boyfriend that you want him to hold your hand by using your body language to your advantage.Make sure to maintain open body language. This means not crossing your arms in front of your body or putting your purse directly on your lap.
Try to make eye contact with him whenever possible. This will let him know you are interested and help him feel connected to you.
Imitate his body language when possible. If he leans in, you should lean in as well. This will help your boyfriend feel like you understand him.

, When you two are sitting down next to each other put your hand next to his. Try to put your hand so close that you are almost touching, but not quite. This should be a good hint that you want to hold hands with him.If you can, try to put your hand palm up next to him so it makes it that much easier for him to hold it.

, Put your hand next to your boyfriend’s hand and leave it there for a moment. Then, ever so slightly, move your finger so that it brushes his finger just for a moment.If he touches your finger back, that probably means he wants to hold hands with you too.
If he moves his hand away, that might mean that he doesn’t want to hold hands with you right then.

Make sure you want to be with this person for the rest of your life.",How to Get a Proposal1," While you don't want to open your first few dates with ""do you want to get married,"" you should find someone who is comfortable with commitment. Signs to look for include:


A willingness to talk about the future.
Emotional and social maturity, the ability to have a discussion or argument calmly.
Prior serious relationships.;
, Make him dinner. Go to movies. Have a picnic in a park. Take the time to get to know each other and develop a solid relationship built on love and trust. Don't rush him with hints about wanting a happy marriage with him until you've been dating for awhile. People change, especially after the wonder and joy of a brand new relationship wear off. You want to see this side of them before you commit ""until death do you part.""


Relationship expert John Molloy, the author of the book, Why Men Marry Some Women and Not Others, says that women who rush a man with hints about marriage too early in the relationship (first 6-8 months) will likely scare him off., Men aren't usually ready to pop the question, at minimum, until age 26 if they are college graduates.If you are looking for a proposal earlier than this, you may need to spend some more time dating before someone pops the question.


Men getting graduate or professional degrees after college usually marry 2-3 years later.
Men who did not go to college generally marry 2-3 years earlier.
After age 33, most men become less likely to marry., Moving in together is a great step towards marriage, because you get to see how you function during mundane, day-to-day life. After 6-8 months or more, try getting a place together and make sure your relationship stays strong. Rushing into marriage before you know you can live together can lead to awkward and unfortunate surprises later on.

, Having the blessing of your family and peers leads to longer marriage satisfaction and lower divorce rates. If you want to hide him from your parents or your friends hate him, there is likely something holding you two back from being truly happy.Ask for opinions about you as a couple from trusted sources. Do they think you seem happy? Could they see you two together for a long time?

, You can't want a wedding ring because you feel pressured or ""you've been dating long enough."" You have to want this person as your partner for the rest of you life. Imagine your life in the future and make sure you see this person in it.

He is your boyfriend, after all, so he shouldn’t mind holding hands with you again. Maybe he hasn’t even thought about it lately, so it’s up to you to initiate.This is a thing to try when just the two of you are alone. You don’t want to embarrass him in front of his friends.
You can try to make it seem lighthearted by laughing as you grab his hand.
But don’t force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do.
You can also brush or bump your hand near his to try to initiate hand holding.

, It’s normal to be nervous about holding hands again. But if you are still willing to make the first move, try grabbing his hand to take him somewhere.


Take his hand and pull him along with you. You can say something like, “Come on. I want to show you something.” Or you could say, “I want to go over there. Let’s go.”
You could even plan with your friend to help make it easier. For example, have your friend stand a little ways away from you and your boyfriend. Have your friend yell for you to come over to where he or she is. Then you can grab your boyfriend’s hand and say “Come on!” Then take him over to see your friend.

, Try giving your boyfriend a high five that goes really slowly. Then when your hands are touching in the high five, leave your hand there for a second and then slowly interlock your fingers with his and pull your hands down.

If you ask him why you don’t hold hands anymore and he says that he doesn’t know why, then you should tell him that it is something you liked and that you miss it.
If he answers that he was afraid you didn’t want to hold hands with him, make sure to tell him that you really do want to hold hands with him.

, If you ask him why he hasn’t been holding your hand, make sure you really listen to what he says. Let him finish what he’s saying without interrupting him.

Discuss the subject of marriage and be honest about what you are looking for.",How to Get a Proposal2," Talk about weddings in casual conversation, bring up cute proposal videos, and comment on friends getting married. See how he reacts, from ""I could never do that,"" to something more interested, like ""That's really cute.""


Don't expect this to get the idea across by itself. This is just a comfortable, low-pressure way to begin the discussion early on.
Many men do not think much about marriage and will not bring it up unless the women does. Women must bring up the subject and make their wishes known, unless they want to stay in an unsatisfying ""status quo"" forever.

, You do not even need to bring up marriage at this point. Discuss career goals, places you might want to live together, and future plans. Make sure to emphasize the ""we"" aspect when talking. You want to see how your partner reacts to a life together.


If they are excited or involved in future plans, then they may very well be thinking of wedding bells as well.
If they don't like talking about the future or making plans then they are likely not interested or ready for a marriage proposal.

, Some people are oblivious when it comes to hints and may need a little extra help in discerning your intentions. Remember: though you may want to be proposed to, your significant other may not be willing to make that big of a commitment yet. Don't pressure them too much because it could end up pushing them away. You don't want to force it, just help the situation along.

, Being honest about what you need in the relationship is a critical part of knowing how to get a proposal. If you want to get married, you cannot sit around and hope your partner is a mind-reader. Sit down and talk about marriage in an open, honest fashion.


Let him know that getting married is important to you.
If he does not want marriage at all, then you need to think about moving on. Having this conversation now, however, can save you months in a relationship that cannot give you what you want.
Some men must realize what they will be losing if they are unwilling to make a commitment to a woman who wants to get married. A woman who is willing to leave a man and move on to another relationship to get what she needs is someone who knows how to get a proposal that will result in a happy marriage.

If your girl is going to trust you enough to have sex with you, whether it's her first time or if she's had sex before, then she has to feel like she can depend on you. One of her fears may be that as soon as you have sex, she won't be able to rely on you anymore because you would have gotten what you wanted. So, prove her wrong by being an upstanding and dependable guy.


Show up when you say you're going to show up. If you routinely pick her up half an hour late for your dates, she'll think that you don't think she's so special, and she'll be less likely to have sex with you.
Don't be a flake. If you say you're going to take her to the beach over the weekend, do it. If you don't stick to your word, she won't be able to trust you.
Be her rock. Let her talk to you about her problems and insecurities while knowing that you can make her feel better.
Don't go hours or even a day or two without returning her phone calls or texts. This will make her feel like she can't depend on you.;
, Some guys can be ready to have sex with a girl in the time it takes to down a beer, while some girls can take months, or even longer, to decide that they're ready to make love. And some girls -- sorry, gentlemen -- are really adamant about holding out for the one, and don't even want to have sex before marriage. So, don't rush into it -- wait for the girl to trust you first.


If your girl is barely comfortable with kissing, then you shouldn't bring up the ""s-word"" for a while.
However, if you and your girlfriend are already comfortable hooking up in bed all the time after just a few weeks, then you can start thinking about taking it to the next level.
If you want to make your girlfriend want to have sex with you, the worst thing you can do is bring it up or try to force it when it's way too early. This will turn your girlfriend off and will make her much less likely to sleep with you.

, Let's face it -- if you're a male of a certain age who is desperate for his girlfriend to have sex with him, then you probably are obsessed with sex. But that doesn't mean you have to make jokes, innuendos, or even blatant references to sex all the time. The last thing you want your girlfriend to think is that you're a horndog who is so obsessed with sex that you don't care which lady comes into your bed. You should make her feel special, like you want only her.


You don't have to hide the fact that you're a man with needs, but you should avoid being vulgar, talking about sex all the time, or talking about other people who have sex all the time.
Don't make derogatory comments about other women. This will make your girlfriend feel like a piece of meat. Remember that you're not with your bros, but with your special lady.

, If you want to make your girlfriend trust you, then you have to be loyal to her. She'll never have sex with you if she thinks you're talking to or checking out other women, or even hanging out with other women. Though you don't have to be rude to or ignore other women, you should have a laser-sharp focus on your girlfriend so she knows that you will always be there for her, especially after you start having sex.


Spend lots of time with her. Make sure that you plan at least one or two dates every week and that you check in with her at least once a day if you're not together.
There's a difference between being loyal and being possessive and smothering your girlfriend with affection. You should make a point of seeing her when you both want to hang out, but don't try to see her 24/7 or she'll begin to pull back.
You should not only show your girl that you're loyal by being loyal to her, but by showing that you're a loyal sibling, friend, and teammate. Show loyalty in many aspects of your life and your girl will be impressed.

, If you want your girlfriend to have sex with you, then you should treat her like a lady, not just like someone you want to hook up with. To do this, you have to be a gentleman and be courteous, kind, understanding, and generally admirable. Open doors for her, give her your coat when she's cold, pull out chairs for her, and help her carry her heavy bags.


Make sure to compliment her to let her know how great she looks or how special she is.
It's important to be a gentleman, but don't do anything that feels too unnatural to you, or she'll be able to tell that you're not being yourself.

, This may sound silly, but if you want your girlfriend to really feel special, then you shouldn't invite her to hang out at your place if it looks like the set for World War Z. You need to make sure to remove any dirty laundry off your floor, clean your counters, and make your bed look and smell as clean and inviting as possible.


Not only will this make your lady feel special, but it'll make her feel more inclined to have sex with you. She won't want to get it on if your bed is covered in candy wrappers and dirty underwear.
If you drive her around a lot, you should also keep a clean car. Give your lady the respect she deserves by making sure she has a clean seat.

, Your girl's biggest fear may be that you don't care at all about her mind because you're too busy obsessing over her body. So, you have to prove her wrong. Show her that you are about who she is as a person, about her hopes and dreams, and about what makes her tick.


Ask her about her friendships, her childhood, and her favorite experiences.
Show her that you value her opinion. Ask her what she thinks about the current political situation in your state, or about the look of your new outfit.
Make eye contact when you talk to her. Show her that everything she says is important to you.

, If you want to build the sexual tension, you have to build the romance first. Make her feel special by taking her out, dressing up, and picking a romantic spot for dinner, a drink, or even just for stargazing. You don't have to do anything corny or out of your element to make her feel special.


Though you and your lady can have fun at baseball games, birthday parties, or at a loud, sweaty concert, these events will be less conducive to lovemaking.

Doing something romantic once in a while will show your lady that she really matters to you.

, If you're not attentive to your lady's everyday needs, then how will you be attentive in the bedroom? Your girl needs to feel like you know when she's sad, nervous, anxious, or even just cold or hungry. Pay attention to her eyes, her body language, and her words to know if there's something bothering her. If you act completely oblivious when she's obviously upset about something, then she'll think you're not really paying attention to her.


If something's wrong, don't be afraid to ask her what's up. This will only show that you care.

, If you really want to treat your lady well, then you have to be able to have an idea about whether or not she's ready for sex. If you're her first boyfriend, if she's sexually inexperienced, or if she's deeply religious or has other moral convictions that make her steadfast about not having sex, then you should back off and wait for her to trust you enough to even consider having sex with you. But here are some ways to know if she does want to have sex with you:


If things have been getting hot and heavy in the hook up department, then she may be ready to move forward.
If she's been talking about sex, giving you sexual compliments, and touching you a lot more, then she may be ready for sex.
If she's been hinting that she wants to sleep over, spends a lot of time in or near your bed, or invites you over late at night, then she may be ready for more intimacy.
If she has deep moral or religious convictions that make her not want to have sex, don't try to force it. Accept that some girls will never have sex until they're married and that there's nothing you can do to change their mind.

, If you plan on trying to have sex, or even talking about having sex with your girl, then you should be prepared with some condoms in case the mood strikes her. This doesn't mean that you should flash the condoms or make her feel uncomfortable, but it does mean that you should have some backup just in case things do go in a favorable direction.


If she wants to have sex and you have to run out to the drugstore for some condoms, this may make your first sexual experience fall flat.

, If you want your girl to have sex with you, then you have to set the mood. You should start the evening by doing something romantic to soften her up. Then, go back to your (clean) apartment, which should be stocked with red wine, grapes, chocolate, and some light jazz on the radio. Light the candles and turn the radio on to get her in a romantic mindset, and offer her something to eat or drink.


If this feels corny, you should only do what makes you both get in the mood. If you just want to dim the lights instead of lighting candles, then that's fine too.

, If you want your girl to have sex with you, then you have to be a master kisser. Even if you've been kissing for a while, you should still know how to kiss her in a variety of ways and make your kisses feel fresh. Don't overwhelm her and grope her the second you lock lips. Instead, take it slow, grazing your lips as you touch her hair or stroke her face.


Take breaks from kissing so she has time to come up for air and want you even more.
You are not very likely to have sex with your girlfriend if all you've done is kiss. It takes a bit longer for things to reach a natural progression.

, If you really want to make your girlfriend want you, then you shouldn't act like a sexual beast, moving rapidly from kissing to touching, to ripping off your clothes and practically levitating into the bedroom. Instead, you should kiss your girlfriend for a few seconds, then hold back, stroke her, and talk to her. Repeat this move a few times and wait for her to go wild.Why does playing hard to get work? Because this will make your girlfriend feel like you like her, but that you're in control of your desires and aren't desperate to get your hands all over her -- even if you are.
This move will make her want to be the one who asks for more.

, If you want to turn on your girlfriend, you can start thinking about doing more than just kissing. Begin by lightly caressing her arms, the back of her head and hair, and then, as things progress, stroke her breasts under her shirt or wait for her to touch you. If your clothes are off or partly off, you can kiss her breasts or touch her in more sensual ways.


Just make sure that your actions are reciprocated -- if you're touching her and she just lies there and doesn't make noise or do anything, then you're probably making her uncomfortable. Make sure she's ready for more before you proceed.
If you're already in the bedroom and hooking up, then you can simply ask her if she's ready to have sex with you. This doesn't have to be elaborate or corny -- just say, ""Are you sure you're ready?"" and be prepared for any answer.

, If your girlfriend says she's not ready to have sex with you, then you shouldn't pressure her. Don't try making any arguments -- saying things like, ""But we've been together for so long,"" ""Everyone else is doing it,"" or ""But I really, really like you,"" isn't going to make her feel any better. In fact, trying to reason with her will only make her more frustrated, annoyed, and much less likely to sleep with you.

, If she changes her mind from yes to no, or asks you to stop during the act, do so immediately. It may be useful to have a chat beforehand about what she wants to do and what she isn't ready for. Pay attention and never make her do something that she isn't comfortable with.

, Learn to translate her reactions, don't insist when she is against. There is always a tomorrow to make another try. It advisable to try a ""turn on"" when her mood is good. Feelings cannot be feigned since they are a function of the mind. Good timing and taking matters easy will ultimately make her mellow down no matter how long the process may take. Just know she will come around when she thinks the time is right.

Don't let it ruin your friendship if she's not interested.",How to Turn a Girl Friend Into a Girlfriend," Your newfound feelings of affection for your girl friend may be light years from her own feelings about you. After all, yesterday you were both friends, while today, at least one of you has shifted into new territory. Has she given you any indication that she might be interested in something deeper than platonic friendship? Have you seen signs of flirting or wanting to be close all the time? Or does she act the way she always has done, friendly, attentive and affectionate but only in the way of a good friend? Paying attention to these things can help you have a better sense of the situation.


See how she acts when she talks to you. Is she the same as she's always been, or has she been suddenly acting more self-conscious? If that's the case, then she may be nervous because she wants something more from you, too.
However, if she does act exactly the same, it doesn't mean that she doesn't have new feelings for you. Still, it helps to try to gauge her feelings before you proceed.
Was she always comfortable telling you about the guys she likes, but she has recently stopped doing that? This could be an indication that you may be the only guy she has feelings for.;
, You may be so hung up on the idea of dating your favorite girl friend that you may not be reading the signs properly. If you have some trusted friends who have hung out with the two of you and can watch you in action objectively, then don't be afraid to ask them what they honestly think your chances are. A true friend will give you his honest opinion, and he may be able to tell you if he thinks she likes you, or if she just sees you as a friend.


Of course, your friends may just be telling you what you want to hear. But if you seek out an honest friend and ask for an honest opinion, you may be in luck.
This doesn't mean that your friends will be able to read the situation better than you can. But it does help to have your suspicions confirmed, or to have your friend break the news that the girl actually likes someone else.

, Be clear. The problem often lies in being nice, as friends usually are. Niceness is an admirable quality in friendship but it's bland when it comes to passion and love. Being nice rather than flirtatious and daring will give her the impression that you are a great friend, but not a great lover. If you keep it up, you'll most likely get stuck in the friend zone. The answer? You really need to flirt more! And if you don't think you're any good at flirting, don't worry––flirting is, and should be, playful and fun.


Don't let her do the usual ""friend"" things with you. Don't let her treat you like a girlfriend or tell you about a boy she likes. Make sure that she sees you as more than that.

, Before you go and ask out your girl friend, make sure that you're really ready to take the risk involved in asking out one of your friends. If she's one of your best friends, or is even your best friend, then you have to make sure that your feelings are really genuine and that you're ready to take the plunge, and to risk the friendship you have by dating. In the end, your friendship may be more important than your romantic relationship.


The truth is that most relationships don't end in marriage, and you may not be able to return to your old friendship when you break up. However, if you really do like the girl and see a real future with her, then you should go for it.

, Make sure you look your best. If you haven't taken a lot of care about your appearance around her before, this will be a good immediate signal that you've taken things up a notch. But it's nice to look your best anyway, as it increases your confidence too. You shouldn't suddenly put a ton of gel in your hair or wear a suit when you hang out, but making an extra effort with your looks will make her notice you more and will make her see that you're starting to view her differently.


Try to dress nicely when you are around her, make sure you have showered, shaved, and done whatever to make sure you look good. But don't turn up in a tuxedo or reeking of aftershave. Dress for the occasion, and smelling like you've just bathed in cologne is a turn off, not a turn on. Less is more with scent. If you look good, you feel good. Taking an effort with your appearance is a way of saying ""Look! I bothered to make myself look nice, and I take care of myself. I care enough about you to dress well.""

, While you may already have a fun relationship, humor can be a path to winning her heart. Try joking around more often and being playful in her presence. Tell her things that are genuinely really funny and help her to see that you're the kind of guy who loves to find the humor and fun in life. Glance at her in suggestive ways, then laugh when she starts looking serious about it (don't come across as a staring oddball).


Find ways to compare your relationship to other funny people you know in real life or in entertainment circles. Even better if these people are romantically attached. Examples of some famous couples brought together by comedy include: Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, Anna Faris and Chris Pratt and Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann.
Sometimes tickle games can work but be careful. If you come across as trying to ""cop a feel"", you're doomed. Moreover, not all girls like tickling. Take your cue from her responsiveness and never overdo it even if she does like it. Be prepared to be tickled in turn.
Teasing the girl slightly is a great way to be playful and to flirt with her a bit. Just make sure you don't end up offending her by mistake.

, You may already be quite affectionate toward one another. However, it's now time to amp up the contact in ways that could be considered flirtatious without crossing the line. For example, aim to touch her at least three times each time you meet up with her. Touch for no longer than two to three seconds (long enough for it to register subconsciously) and only touch her where it won't be uncomfortable, such as her hand, shoulder or neck.


Share food. The act of sharing one another's food when out dining or having a snack is intimate and can increase the chances of closeness.
Hugs are good. They express friendship but also help increase the closeness that might help you to become more than friends.

, Do things for her, like helping her out whenever you can. This could be anything from housework and maintenance to homework and preparing for interviews. Helpfulness is a sign of being considerate, which is very sexy. She'll see that you care about her and want to do nice things for her. Just make sure you don't do everything for her, or she'll think of you as a puppy dog. She should do nice things for you, too.


Being useful and helpful does not mean be bossy or superior. If she can do something herself, admire her ability openly rather than suggest you could do it better. Nothing scares off a potential romantic interest than arrogance or belittling.

, Don't just sit there and nod your head pretending to listen. Girls love it when you listen and take the time to truly understand them. Not only that, but listening will benefit the potential future relationship and also strengthen your current friendship. Show her that you can be boyfriend material by being a gentleman.


When she talks to you, make eye contact and put away your phone or other distractions. Let her see that you really care about every word she says.
Avoid interrupting her. Wait until she's finished to say what you have to say.

, Good ones to remember include her birthday, siblings, phone number, favourite food, favourite colors, hobbies, ambition and things that she has already told you. Write down these important details if your memory is not good; it may help jog your memory just before important chats. This will help her see that you really do care about her.

, If you both like to dance and spend time partying, offer to be her date. It may be reassuring for her at first to have someone familiar by her side, while the rhythm of the party and the natural excitement of the event might help to turn things your way. Spending time together at the party can put your relationship in a whole new light.

, Use your body language to get closer to her as you get stronger signals that she's interested. Lean your shoulders towards her, lean on her very gently, face her often and use touch frequently. Again, hugs are always good! Take note of how she responds when you try to get closer to her. If she welcomes the closeness and seems comfortable with it, then you're on the right track.


Take care not to fall into or on her, to grab her or to squeeze or hold her too hard.

Play footsie. This should only happen when you are sure she's got the message and has started to reciprocate your amorous intent. It's cheeky, titillating and fun when the moment is right.

, Don't spend too much time around her. Instead, spend lots of time, and then none for a while, then more again, and flirt while you are there. While you are gone, she is given a chance to think about you, which hopefully she will. This will also help you play hard to get. If she knows that you'll always be available, then she'll be less likely to want to hang out with you.


Spend more time with her when she is happy than when she is sad. This helps her to associate happiness with you. If you are successful in making her your girlfriend, that's when it becomes important to support her when she needs it.

, Gradually increase your flirting ways, provided you're getting the right signals in return. Let things happen naturally. Tease her a bit, be playful, touch her lightly, and just treat her differently than you would other girls. Let her see that you're not just flirtatious for the sake of it, but that you're directing your romantic feelings toward her.

, As you are getting closer to her, and maybe you feel like she feels a little something for you, check for these signs to see if maybe she likes you back.


She has one color nail varnish one day, and changes it the next when she's going out with you. She's trying to get your attention with the little things.
Hem lines go up, neck lines go down. Basically, she's seeing a different side of you, and she wants you... to see a different... bit of her.... as it were. She's establishing that she can be sexy too.
She bats her eyelashes and looks at you a lot.
Her movements become more gentle
Her tone of voice lowers slightly and becomes slower; and
She starts flirting just a little.

, Go on one-on-one outings to the mall or movies. Maybe go out in the evening. When you first see her (make sure you're alone to avoid any unwanted ears) say something like ""Wow. You look beautiful."" And smile.

, If you want to ask her out, then pick a place where you'll have some privacy, and a time when she won't have a lot of other stuff on her mind. Though you don't want to wait around forever to pop the question, you should work on finding some privacy, and making sure she'll be in a good mood. For example, don't pull her aside right before her big math test, or she'll be too distracted and stressed out to listen to you.


Once you've found the time, get her alone, trying to be as casual as possible. If her friends are five feet away, you won't be able to have a good conversation.

, Don't make a big deal about it. Just give her a few compliments and tell her how much you like spending time with her. Let her know why she's special to you and that you're paying attention to all of the things that make her wonderful. Don't make her too embarrassed or lay it on too thick; just take a few minutes to make her feel like the special girl that she is.


You can even gauge her reaction as you're doing this -- if she looks uncomfortable or like she's searching for the nearest exit, then you may not want to proceed. But if she's excited and looks like she wants to hear more, then you may be in luck.

, Don't spend too much time building up to it. Just tell her that you've really liked being her friend, but that you want to take your relationship to the next level. Make her see that you've really thought about it, and that, though you value your friendship, you're willing to take the risk to take your relationship to the next level. She will be flattered that you like her so much as a friend and that you've put enough thought into it to see that you do want something more from her.


Just say, ""Would you like to be my girlfriend?"" Or, ""Would you like to go out with me?"" You don't have to spend hours building up to this point. When you ask her, look her in the eyes and show her how sincere you are.
Or, when you are pretty sure she's flirting back, or that she likes you too, lean in really close, and say something along the lines of ""I have to tell you something. I think you're beautiful, funny, sweet and honest. I don't want to ruin our friendship. I was just wondering whether you felt the same about me."" Be prepared for her answer. Let's just hope she's smiling and saying yes.
Remember if you come on too strong, then you risk ruining your friendship. Take your time. Timing is everything, and you don't want to rush it.

, If she wants to be your girlfriend, then great! You can give her a hug, celebrate, and take her out. But if she doesn't want to go down that path, then try not to be too disappointed. Remind yourself that this may be a blessing in disguise, and that you may be better off continuing a long-lasting friendship than having a short-lived relationship that will leave you feeling awkward and unlikely to be friends again. Sure, you'll need some time to get over your bruised ego, but after a few weeks, you and the girl may naturally fall into friendship again.

He will also be able to get an idea of what it will be like to live together by having to share daily space, routines, and chores.Make sure that at least some of the nights he is spending at your apartment are work nights so that he can begin to get a feel for his new routine.
Try giving him a task, like DIY repairs or rearranging the furniture, so that he can feel he has an active role in your house or apartment.

, Giving him a key will both demonstrate your desire to live together as well as give him unfettered access to your apartment or house. A key might also be needed for more practical reasons, like checking up on your apartment when you are out of town or grabbing something for you before you decide to meet. However, once he has a key, tell him to let himself in when he comes over so that he can get used to using his key. The more he uses the key the more likely he will be associating your house or apartment with home.


If he doesn’t already have a key to your apartment, try to give it to him in a fun or meaningful way, like while on a date or a “special” delivery at work.

Understand how sex can feel different when you're pregnant.,
Know that orgasms can cause uterine contractions.,
Practice smart sex.,
Choose a position that makes it easier for both of you.,
Use lots of pillows.,
Try alternative forms of sex.,
Go easy on yourself.",How to Have Sex During Pregnancy," Sex is safe during pregnancy provided you have a low risk pregnancy with few complications. Your doctor will let you know if you should avoid sex for any reason at all to avoid complications. You may be advised to avoid sex if you have experienced the following:Unexplained vaginal bleeding
Leakage of amniotic fluid
History of premature labor
Other medical conditions;
, One of the most common concerns of mothers and fathers-to-be is that sex will hurt the baby, or that they might ""bump into"" the baby during sex, but in reality there is no reason to worry. A woman's cervix forms a barrier between her uterus and vagina, cushioning the baby and preventing harm from occurring. Most women can enjoy a healthy and fulfilling intimate relationship throughout their pregnancy, right up until their delivery date.

Consider bringing up the issue of having sex while pregnant during a prenatal visit to the physician. A little reassurance from your physician that sex will not hurt the baby may help both people feel more comfortable.

, Since pregnancy increases blood flow to the pelvic area, many women feel increased sensation in the clitoris during sexual intercourse. Some women find this pleasurable, while others find it uncomfortable. The following changes may also be present:A feeling of fullness after sex
Abdominal cramping after sex
Sore nipples
Increased vaginal discharge

, These types of contractions do not lead to labor, but if you're experiencing them for the first time, you might get confused.Orgasms are unlikely to trigger labor, so there's no need to avoid sex on these grounds.

, The same practices that apply to sex at other times apply during pregnancy. If you have more than one sexual partner or are at risk of contracting an STI, be sure to use a condom each time you have sex. Putting yourself at risk of infection may put the baby at risk as well.

, If you and your partner are interested in maintaining a healthy sexual relationship during pregnancy, then you must be wondering what positions will work best for you as your belly grows and expands. The best thing you can do during your pregnancy is keep an open mind and be creative. You'll probably need to try out different positions and experiment a bit to find something that works for both of you. Most women will find that it is uncomfortable to enjoy sex in a missionary position after about the first or mid second trimester, once the stomach starts getting big. Try being the one on top instead.
Many find that having intercourse in a ""spooning"" position is a very comfortable way to have sex while pregnant.Try sitting on a chair or on the edge of the bed while your partner kneels or stands.Getting on your hands and knees while your partner enters from behind is another position that works for many.

, Pillows are your friend when it comes to having sex while pregnant. Use them under your bottom or other parts of your body to prop yourself and get more comfortable. If one position doesn't seem to be working out, try modifying it by using pillows to achieve a better angle.

, Mutual masturbation can be a satisfying and low-key alternative to vaginal intercourse, and many women find it more comfortable in the later stages of pregnancy. Others find that oral sex is a good alternative to vaginal intercourse, since it requires less movement on the part of the pregnant woman.


During oral sex, make sure your partner does not blow air into the vagina; in rare cases, this could cause an air embolism to form and potentially harm the baby.If your partner has oral herpes, a dental dam should be used during oral sex.
Anal sex is not recommended during pregnancy, as it can lead to an infection that could spread to the vagina., If sex just doesn't feel good during pregnancy, there's no need to push yourself to do it. Some women find it uncomfortable to have sex during pregnancy, and others experience a reduced sex drive. Do what feels right for you, and make sure you communicate your needs to your partner.

Ask your boyfriend about his schedule.,
Talk with your boyfriend about when you should call and visit.,
Find creative ways to spend time together.,
Make the most of your visits and calls.",How to Avoid Bothering Your Busy Boyfriend1," Find out when your boyfriend is free and when he needs to be left alone to get things done. Learn what hours he works, when he’s at school, and what times he goes to sports practice or works on his hobbies. You might want to make a copy of your boyfriend’s schedule so you won’t forget it. If he uses an online scheduling tool like Google Calendar, ask him to give you access to it.;
, Don’t just guess when you should call or visit your boyfriend – discuss it ahead of time so you’ll know for sure. Ask him when he prefers to talk on the phone, and see whether he has any downtime during the day when you can come say hello.


For instance, maybe he’s free to have lunch with you once a week, or maybe he can talk on the phone with you when he gets out of class at 4 PM.

, If your boyfriend is too busy to go on long dates with you every week, look for other reasons to get together. For instance, you could help him with yard work or go to the gym together in the mornings., If you can’t see your boyfriend often, focus on making your talks and visits fun and memorable when you do get together. Plan ahead, even if that just means renting a movie and cooking a nice dinner. If you’re worried you’ll forget to tell him things, write them down so you’ll have plenty to talk about next time you see each other.

Treat her like you would anyone else.,
Don’t ask ‘those’ questions.,
Don’t overthink gender roles.,
Avoid talking about the politics of war.,
Don’t ignore the elephant in the room.",How to Date a Military Woman1," Put yourself in her shoes. She has a high profile job that creates stereotypes about her personality. Obviously, she has her own personality just like anyone else. It’s not like she's going to show up for the date in fatigues, so don’t treat her like that.;
, Active service members and veterans get a slew of strange and somewhat uncomfortable questions from civilians. If you’re trying to make a good impression, being just another person to ask one of these will not make you stand out. She probably doesn’t want to talk to you about the mental side effects of violence on a first date, or how it makes her feel.


Some inappropriate, or at least annoying questions may be: Did you kill anyone? Do you have PTSD? Did you see anybody die? Did you get shot at? Was it hot? , Male-female relations are in a period of transition. Adding the expectations and stereotypes of military women can make this more confusing. The best way to act around military women is simply not any different. Be yourself and be respectful.


If you’re the kind of person who opens doors for people, continue to do that. If you don’t generally do that, finding ways to ‘treat her like a woman’ is not necessary.
Men dating a military woman shouldn't feel the need to act more masculine around her.

, If you disapprove of any and all war, dating someone in the military is a recipe for disaster. On the other hand, don’t come off as a cheerleader for the military. Going out of your way to praise servicemen and women will sound like you are just trying to kiss up to her.


It’s natural, especially if there are big current events, to bring up politics in conversation. If you regularly discuss politics, don’t hide your interests from her because she's in the military. In this case, however, avoid making overt statements of approval or disapproval with the military.

, The best way to behave naturally is to acknowledge something obvious to both of you, if needed. She is a female soldier. You are a civilian. This is a new and strange dynamic that has not been common in American culture thus far. If you would feel more at ease mentioning this up front, she will likely respect your honesty.


For example, you might say something like: “I’ve never gone on a date with someone in the military before. I’m trying to act like I would around anyone else, but I want you to know this is uncharted territory for me.”

Focus on clarity rather than eloquence.",How to Date Across a Language Barrier," There will inevitably be some mishaps and miscommunications, but don’t worry about that too much. You both know that these things will happen, and you will have a better time if you just go with it and relax.


There will always be things in life that you cannot control. When dating someone who speaks another language, understand that there will be some problems with communication, and rather than getting upset, just keep moving past it.;
, Rather than getting frustrated or upset if you have trouble communicating something with your date, laugh it off. Laughing is a universal language—anyone can understand it! If you both relax and laugh off the issues and keep moving forward, your date will go much smoother.There will probably be some awkward moments, just like any other first date. Learning to laugh at yourself in these moments will make them much more bearable and even enjoyable.

, One of the trickier things with trying to communicate in a language you don’t know very well is that it will be much harder to pick up on nuances like sarcasm. Try not to use sarcasm while speaking with your date, as you might unintentionally offend them or confuse them.


Even if sarcasm is like second nature to you, understand that it probably won’t come off the way you intend for it to when your date doesn’t understand your language very well. Just be straightforward and clear., You may have to repeat what you have said once or twice for your date to fully understand you. Be patient, and speak a little slower. Enunciate your words clearly, and try to language that is a little more simple and clear.


You also might consider going on a date in a location that is quieter and more relaxed. This way, you won’t have to talk over any loud noise.

, Having a language barrier does not have to automatically eliminate the romance from those first few dates, no matter how challenging it might seem at first. There are ways to be romantic without using any words at all.


Simply giving your date flowers, opening doors for them, or putting your arm around them can exude romance without saying a word at all.Smiling and making eye contact will also help forge that romantic connection, despite any problems you might be having with verbal communication. Use body language to let your date know you are enjoying yourself and their company.

, If you speak different languages, it’s likely you come from different cultural backgrounds, as well. Understanding your date’s culture and how it differs from your own can help prevent any unintended disrespect when communicating with them.


Dating and relationships are often viewed differently in different cultures, too. Make sure you understand how your date views romantic relationships, so you can both be on the same page., When learning a new language, we usually learn the formal version of that language. Slang and colloquialisms are present in every language, and you will likely learn these more from native speakers than from a textbook.


Slang is a way to forge commonality between different people who speak the same language. By learning a few slang terms here and there, you will be able to communicate in a more relaxed, informal way with your date., Even if you are just beginning to date, you and your partner might have different ideas as to what role each of you will play in the relationship, due to your differing cultures. It’s important to learn and understand these roles early on.Because of the language barrier, it might be difficult to establish these things. Be as clear as possible when communicating your ideas.

, If you are curious about your date’s culture, ask them about it! If the language barrier is making it too difficult to do so, you can rely more on research you do on your own.


By making the attempt to understand your date’s culture and background, you will show them that you care, and that you are really interested in making the relationship successful, despite the language barrier. , You might think you can just rely on your date to help get you by and teach you the basics, but your best bet for learning a new language will be textbooks and software designed to help you learn. There are a great many books and software options for you to choose from.


There are many online-based programs you can use, both free and for a fee. Consider how much time you will want to dedicate to learning the language before you make a big purchase.Using language textbooks and dictionaries always helps, but make sure you get a book that shows you how to pronounce the words phonetically to avoid any mishaps.

, It might seem silly to try to read a book in a different language, but reading is one of the best ways to learn a new language. Reading a book allows you to see the language in action, rather than just word-by-word.


Books will teach you all different aspects of the language, including grammar, sentence structure, and style. They’re also an enjoyable way to experience your favorite books through a different lens., If you constantly ask your date how to say things in their language, they might start to feel a bit bored or even more like a tutor than a romantic partner. Try to avoid alienating them by consistently asking them to translate for you.Don’t spend entire date nights trying to learn the language from your partner. Try to brush up on the basics ahead of time, and use your time together to try to establish your relationship.

, Keep a pocket dictionary in your date’s native language with you when you are together. That way, you can look up words on your own and better keep up with the conversation.


There are also apps available for smartphones that you can use when you need to translate words from another language. These apps might be more handy than carrying a physical book., Just because you might have difficulty with verbal communication, you can still interact with your partner in different ways. There are types of nonverbal communication you can employ.


Use hand gestures and facial expressions to better communicate your ideas. A study found that vocal tonality and body language were better indicators of the emotion behind the words than the actual words., A language barrier can be a tough hurdle to get over, especially in a romantic relationship. It’s important that you don’t get impatient with one another while you try to learn how to communicate.


Misunderstandings and difficulty having quick, easy conversations are normal when there is a language barrier. Be prepared for these things, and be patient when they arise.Understand that conversations will take longer. Even simple discussions about where to go for dinner, or how your day was might end up taking longer than if you were speaking to someone who understands your native language.

, Even though you might just want to nod and agree when you don’t understand something your partner has said, it’s important that you let them know you didn’t understand, and work to clarify things. Like any relationship, being open about these things is pertinent.


Cultural differences can lend themselves to unintended disrespect or offense. Make sure you speak up if you misunderstood, and help clarify things to your date if they have misunderstood you., Even if your sentences have to be shorter and more concise, getting your point across should be the objective. Don’t worry too much about sounding like you are more well-versed in the language than you really are.


Use short, simple sentences. Emphasize your words with gestures and facial expressions. These kinds of actions might help fill in the gaps left in your actual words.

Clean up everything yourself.",How to Cook For Your Girlfriend," Before you plan that exquisite gourmet meal, it's a good idea to think about where you are in your relationship. If you've been with a girl for a while, cooking a fancy meal that takes a lot of time to prepare can seem really romantic. If you just met the girl last week, however, that same meal can seem kind of creepy. Early in a relationship, it may be best to stick with simple dishes--still mindful, of course, of what your girlfriend likes to eat — or you might give the impression that you're too eager to please her. Besides, if you cook a six-course dinner on the second date, imagine how many courses you're going to have to make if you're still together in a year or two.;
, You can cook just about anything you want, really — it's the thought that counts. Put a little more thought into the meal, however, and it counts a little more. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that if your girlfriend is a vegetarian you should skip the meatloaf, but if you really want to make the meal special, you'll need to look beyond the obvious. This can require some advance preparation — you need to listen to her and make mental notes to yourself. For example, maybe a couple months ago she mentioned how she used to love Brunswick stew but she never learned to make it. Surprise her with some for dinner, and she'll be amazed you remembered. In other words, you're not just cooking, you're being an attentive boyfriend or girlfriend.

, By now you should know what you want to make. Get out the cookbook (there's probably one lying around somewhere) or get on the web. Want to make chicken enchiladas? Just enter ""chicken enchiladas recipe"" in your search engine, and you'll have probably hundreds of variations to choose from. Read the instructions and ingredients and choose a recipe that you feel comfortable making — if the first one you find looks too difficult, keep looking.

, Depending on what your main dish is and how big a production you've decided to make your meal, you may want to add side dishes, a salad or a dessert. Often, entrée recipes will have suggestions for side dishes and wines, or you can find an entire meal planned out. If the recipe you've chosen to make doesn't give you any suggestions, look at similar recipes for ideas.

, If you're planning on cooking today, you're probably in a hurry — skip this step. Otherwise, make plans with your girlfriend. You can just tell her you'd like to cook dinner (or breakfast or lunch) for her, or you can surprise her. If you're going to surprise her, make up some pretext — a good one is to tell her you're taking her out to eat — so that she will (a) show up and (b) show up hungry.

, A day or two before you will cook, go through each and every item in your recipe(s) and see if you have it in your kitchen. Make sure you have enough of each ingredient, as well, and make sure they're all edible (1 egg won't substitute for 3, and rotting vegetables just aren't the same as fresh). Also, check to see that you have all the kitchen utensils you will need (you can buy these or, preferably, try to borrow them from somebody). If you don't have something, write it down on your shopping list. Make sure your list is detailed — include the quantity you'll need and any other pertinent information. Of course, if you're like a lot of bachelors, you can probably just take the recipe with you to the grocery store — you know you don't have any of that stuff.

, Bring your list to the grocery store and purchase what you need. Cross each item off the list as you put it in your cart, and before you leave, make sure you've got everything. You'll probably see a lot of girls at the grocery store; this is not the time to flirt.

, Prepare as much as you can ahead of time. Sometimes this is absolutely necessary (you may need to marinate something overnight, for example), so pay close attention to your recipe. Even when advance preparation isn't required, the more you do early, the easier your cooking experience will be.

, Make sure you start your cooking early enough to have the meal ready on time, but not so early that it's sitting around for hours. The recipe may give you an estimate of preparation and cooking times; you may want to add a little time onto these if you're not a proficient chef. Unless you really know what you're doing, follow the recipe's instructions exactly.

, Be creative with the ambiance you set for your meal. Maybe you want to have it on the balcony under the stars, or maybe it's breakfast in bed — the sky's the limit. As in your choice of meal, you may want to consider where your relationship is at. If you're looking to inject some romance into a long-term relationship, dim the lights, hire a violinist and break out the candles and roses. If you've only been dating a week, however, you might want to keep it simple: dim the lights, get a friend to guard the door to make sure no other girls stop by, and break out the thick, classy paper plates.

, Your service will depend on the meal you've chosen, of course, but a couple of rules apply regardless. Make sure the food is ready to be served — hot foods should be hot and cold foods cold, for example — and serve your girlfriend her food first. Make sure she is comfortable and has everything she needs to enjoy your magical feast. Wait for her to take her first bite before you dig in.

, Just focus on your girlfriend, not the food. Even if you're insecure about your cooking, act confident. Don't keep asking her if she really likes this or that. You've worked hard to prepare this meal for your girlfriend, but you don't need to tell her that — she knows.

, This may make the best impression of all. Do the dishes and clean off the table.

Reassess the relationship.",How to Avoid Bothering Your Busy Boyfriend2," If you know your boyfriend is busy, don’t call or text him, even if you miss him. If you interrupt him too often, you’ll seem clingy and he’ll get annoyed. Stick to the times you agreed on for talking and hanging out together.Don’t initiate all your conversations. Give your boyfriend a chance to call you first sometimes, too.
If you’re really tempted to call or text but you know it’s a bad time, turn off your phone, or go somewhere and leave your phone at home.

, If your boyfriend is really busy, he may not have time to watch the adorable baby video you tagged him in, or to check out the list of artists for a local concert. Ask him what's a happy medium for social media activity and stick to it. Numerous Facebook and Instagram messages can distract him from school or work.

, There are all kinds of reasons your boyfriend might not call or text you back. Maybe he forgot to take his phone off silent mode after class, or maybe he got held up by something at work. Don’t panic or assume he’s being passive-aggressive with you – everything is probably fine.Whatever you do, don’t send him a barrage of texts or calls. He’ll get back to you when he can. Find a way to distract yourself in the meantime.

, Be easygoing and flexible, and don’t try to monopolize your boyfriend’s free time. His family and other friends are important to him, and he needs to spend time with them sometimes. He may also need regular time alone to recharge., If your boyfriend never seems to make time for you, you may want to decide if that's the kind of relationship you were looking for. Some partners aren't simply cut out to be together. You might prefer a relationship in which your partner is more available to you--and that's not what you're getting with a boyfriend who's always busy.Before you make a decision, you might first talk to him about your needs. You might say something like, ""I really want to spend more time with you on the weekends, but your schedule is always jam-packed. Us not spending time together is really bothering me. Will it always be like this?""
If your boyfriend tries to make changes to better accommodate you in his schedule, then you might give the relationship another shot.
You might also look for other signs of incompatibility, like different values and beliefs.

, If you suspect that your boyfriend is using being busy as an excuse to push you away, he’s probably not the right person for you. He might be married to his job or goals, and unless you have a similar mindset, you’ll probably end up feeling unloved and neglected.Sometimes people avoid their significant other because they don’t know how to break up. If you think this is what your boyfriend is doing, don’t drag things out. Be the more mature person and call it quits.

Respect your own time.",How to Avoid Bothering Your Busy Boyfriend3," Your boyfriend has priorities, and there’s no reason you shouldn’t have some, too. Keep yourself busy doing things you need to do. If you feel like you don’t have much to do, set some new goals or work on an area of your life that needs improvement.For example, you can put extra effort into your work or studying, spend more time with your family, or catch up on chores around the house.

, Your boyfriend shouldn’t be the only source of fun in your life. Fill your time with things you enjoy, and if you don’t have many hobbies, go get some. Besides being happier, you’ll also be more attractive and interesting when you have a life outside your relationship.For instance, you could start working out, learn a new language, write a novel, or pick up a craft.

, Make time to see your friends regularly, and don’t just talk about your boyfriend with them. Do things related to your shared interests, like going to concerts, shopping, or watching movies. Spend less time with friends who are needy towards their own boyfriends, since their behavior may influence you., Your plans, goals, and friendships are just as important as your boyfriend’s, so don’t just drop everything the second he wants to see you. Make sure he respects your time as much as you respect his."

Accept this part of your relationship.,
Stick to normal hobbies.,
Send her phone cards.,
Call or video chat.",How to Date a Military Woman2," If your girlfriend is career military, long-distance dating may become a regular part of your relationship. You will have to make peace with her being away, and recognize her service to the country. If you love her, it is likely that her sacrifice is part of your attraction.

, Don’t begin doing anything you wouldn’t do when she is at home. If you normally go out to bars, keep doing that. If not, don’t start. Since this may become a regular part of your relationship, creating stability between times she is here and away is important for both of you. It helps her imagine where you are day-to-day, and helps you cope with her absence.

, One of the best ways to wow your military girlfriend or wife is to make it easy for her to communicate with you and others. Send her phone cards so she doesn’t have to worry about that logistical detail when she's on leave. It’s also a loving and subtle reminder that you are there and ready to talk when she is., Modern technology has made long-distance relationships much more bearable. Calling on the phone is the bare minimum, and video chat is better. Being able to see each other in your respective environments helps you picture each other. Don’t start hating these methods of communication, because they are a part of your life now.


Long-distance relationships have a tendency to reinforce idealized versions of a person in their partner’s head. Seeing each other helps you keep track of little details, like hairstyle changes. Facial expressions are also a better indicator of feelings than voice alone.

Avoid becoming ‘more military.’ When your wife or girlfriend comes home, don’t try to compensate for your non-military job in any way.,
Accept that her temperament may have changed.,
Don’t be shocked by aggressiveness.,
Make dialogues possible.,
Consider counseling or support groups.",How to Date a Military Woman3," Making the house uncharacteristically neat or forcing yourself to wake up much earlier than normal will be an uncomfortable adjustment for both of you. As always, be yourself. After all, she chose to date someone who is not in the military.

, Many women who return from the military, and even active duty, act more masculine. You may find that she acts like ‘one of the guys’ around you, or displays locker room behavior. This may make your relationship dynamic different than it was before deployment. She may slowly return to her former civilian personality, but accept her as she is. After all, you are not going to be the exact same person either.For men dating a military woman, it would be wrong of you to ask her to play housewife when she returns from being a completely different person. You are trying not to change yourself around her – let her do the same.

, It is common for returning veterans to be more aggressive than they were before deployment. This applies to women as well. As long as there is no physical or emotional abuse, give her space to readjust to civilian life. This is a natural component of her chosen career.


This does not mean joining in with her. Wrestling or physically fighting with her may start playfully and become much worse.
Gently let her know if her aggressiveness is getting out of hand or becoming unwelcome. Giving her space does not mean tolerating actual abuse.

, Though you shouldn’t ask probing questions about her service, she may need to eventually talk. Even though she probably realizes it, let her know you are always happy to listen. Veterans who start bottling up their feelings early after discharge are setting a precedent for avoiding communication that will be hard for them to break. Being a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on are important roles for you to play in your relationship. , If readjusting to civilian life is hard on either or both of you, consider talking to a professional. It can be just one of you, or couples counseling. There are also support groups for veterans of all wars, female veterans, significant others, and so on. Do a web search to find groups in your area.

Spot your obsessiveness.,
Check your feelings.,
As soon as you've recognized that you're feeling obsessed toward your partner, put the brakes on and slow right down.,
Keep your hobbies and friends.,
Take time for yourself.,
Reaffirm who you are and why you are special as an individual.,
Practice detachment.",How to Avoid Being an Obsessive Girlfriend1," Obsessive behavior in the romantic context tends to involve being constantly preoccupied with the loved one, wanting to be with him or her all hours of the day and contriving it so that you actually are together as much as possible. Romantic obsession can lead you to presume the person you love needs you as much, causing you to inject yourself into every part of his or her life, whether it be family, home, work, and so on, offering unasked for advice, support and remodeling even though there's no indication any of this is useful or wanted. In some cases, obsession is the flip side of jealousy, in which case you wish you had similar characteristics to the person you love and in some way you're trying to adopt his or her character for yourself by being constantly present.;
, You may find yourself quite exhausted, wrung out emotionally and very intense whenever you spend time together, because you're too preoccupied by concentrating on the two of you without taking a break. You might be more focused on quantity of time rather than quality, even though this often feels aimless.


It's a fairly common tendency to become obsessive at the beginning of a relationship. It's new, it's exciting and this person is endlessly fascinating to you. By realizing that you're not the first person to feel this way about somebody, you can let go of guilt and concentrate instead on dealing with it in a healthy way. Perhaps your obsession has roots in feelings of insecurity and fear, or it could simply be about being totally amazed by how wonderful this person in your life is. Whatever the reason, you can tame it!
Ask yourself why you feel you need to mesh so completely with another person––perhaps you can answer this alone by simply working through the reasons and questioning them. But if not, don't be afraid to seek counselling if you think that could help you overcome your obsessive tendency.

, This doesn't mean not seeing each other at all but it does mean reintroducing a more balanced routine into your relationship. Find ways to shorten time spent together while increasing the quality of such time.

, The key to a healthy relationship is balance, rather than hanging out together closely every possible moment. Couples need time apart to re-establish their individual identities; moreover, time spent apart helps to define the boundaries of who you are outside of your relationship in your partner's eyes too. Remind yourself of who you are by reconnecting with friends and relatives, or picking up those old hobbies you've been setting aside. Suggest that your partner do the same. This is a simple way to show him or her that you're confident and interesting (even if you don't feel that way for now). Suggest that your partner goes out with his or her friends while you visit with yours. Or even suggest he or she work on his hobby or interest while you take time for yours, separately.

, Visit friends, family, take a class, anything you find interesting or would like to learn. Do this even if you have to tear yourself away from your beloved. He or she should be supportive of you, and encourage your interests, too. In fact, this is a good indicator of whether or not your partner can handle separation and being left to his or her own devices––if not, it could be a warning sign to you that your partner is overly attached or has co-dependent tendencies. Focusing only on the one you love isn't living your own life to the fullest. By taking time for yourself, you make room for personal growth and new experiences, as well as staying well-rounded. It isn't selfish––it's the opposite because it shows trust in your partner and establishes expectations that both of you will operate as individuals as well as a couple. And, if you aren't the best person you can be, then you can't expect to be the person you need to be for your significant other. Having your own experiences will only improve your relationship by giving you more to talk about.

, Do those things that you do best. If you're not sure what that is yet, then try everything. If you're feeling less than confident, or insecure in your relationship, sometimes it helps to go back to something that created a sense of accomplishment. Don't look for confidence from your partner––instead, find it within yourself. To do this, seek out those things at which you can succeed and receive recognition for outside of your coupledom.

, You don't own the person you love, just as he or she doesn't own you. Yet, obsession is a little like trying to own a person and once you feel this way, it's easy to presume that this person can't possibly thrive without your input or support, even though this assumption is totally in your own head. Practicing detachment can teach you to let go without feeling afraid that you'll lose this person. Set aside this worry and have faith that it's okay to step back and stop trying to solve everything for your beloved––you can store your energies for when you really are called upon to be strong for him or her.

Give your beloved space.,
Suggest your partner take time for his or her hobbies and interests.,
Bond by doing things your partner enjoys.,
Know when to back off.,
Be bold and suggest some time apart for a few hours or days.,
Trust your partner.",How to Avoid Being an Obsessive Girlfriend2," If he or she wants to hang out with friends, encourage it––you're not joined at the hip. Let your partner know that you want him or her to have a good time and to spend as much time with friends as liked. If you have to, fake your enthusiasm and put on a brave face. There will be times when you'd really rather spend that time with your beloved than seeing him or her out with friends; however, forcing your partner to spend time with you usually results in further pulling away, mostly out of fear that you'll insist on this state of affairs eternally and he or she won't ever be able to spend time with friends. If you're able to encourage and support your beloved's time away, it will reinforce his or her belief that you want what is best for him or her, which strengthens your relationship.

, The key to longevity in any relationship is to make it clear that you're neither threatened nor resentful about your partner's distinct interests. By encouraging your partner to pursue his or her interests, you will strengthen your togetherness. And by assuring him or her that you love spending time together while making it clear that his or her hobbies and interests are also important, you remove the guilt trip. It's even more helpful if you clarify that you can––and will––find enjoyable things to occupy your time when apart, freeing him or her up to enjoy the time spent apart. Just be sure that you don't say one thing but show you really mean something else; that's manipulative and will result in resentment.

, By showing a willingness to be interested in his or her endeavours beyond your own interests, you establish that you aren't obsessive about forcing your partner to ""join only your clubs"" and that you're not jealous of his or her interests. While you don't have to continue participating directly in your partner's interests, displaying an initial interest and making it clear that you respect his or her choice will go a long way to proving that you can handle any differences between the two of you and that you won't turn alternative interests into a guilt-trip. It might be as simple as helping him or her to find a place, a club, an item or a book––whatever the interest is––to get things started. Then, give him or her the space to enjoy the interests without being crowded by you.

, Learn a little body language so that you can note when he or she is feeling a bit crowded or cheesed off about spending too much time together. Indicators might include turning away from you, not making eye contact and refusing to cuddle or touch as usual. Verbally, you may hear sighs, mumbling or sounds of derision when you suggest spending time together on that occasion. Don't presume the worst but equally, don't ignore the signs––ask what's wrong and be very open to hearing the answer. Listen attentively to what your partner explains and listen also for what's not said. It should be fairly clear to you that this is an issue about wanting more space and rather than feeling threatened, try to respond with openness and a willingness to find solutions.


Don't probe too deeply––ask a few questions but not so many as to be invasive and cause your partner to not respond at all.
Listen to what your gut instinct is telling you. Most times, it'll be plain as day that the excessive time spent together is at the core of the discontentment. Don't play coy or naive; facing the matter is much fairer on both of you.
If you feel your partner is pulling away, don't force yourself on him or her more. It may be tempting to cling even more but you'll need to resist this response. Let go and have faith in the one you love.

, Let him or her know you're available as soon he or she wants to catch up again. In the meantime, find other things to do with your time. If you really must talk over what's happening and he or she isn't ready to do so yet, talk to someone you can trust, in very broad terms so as not to give away your intimate trust. Simply talking it through might help you to realize that you're overreacting.

, If lack of trust is at the heart of your obsessiveness, the relationship is doomed and the obsessiveness will only increase over time. If you have trust issues, deal with them before they eat you up and establish an unhealthy pattern toward all of your relationships. While someone may have breached your trust in the past, assuming that every person will do the same thing to you restricts your opportunity to discover that trust is more often returned than not. Many people, when given trust, will feel so deeply grateful for the trust placed in them that they'll do anything to repay it in kind. Ultimately though, if you don't trust your partner, you have a bigger problem than obsession and you really shouldn't be in the relationship. Either you trust your partner, or you don't––which is it to be?

Pace yourselves.,
Stop calling, texting and checking up all of the time.,
Never turn stalker.,
Set up days or times to reconnect after spending time apart.,
Create endpoints in your dates, to ensure that time spent together truly is about quality and not quantity.",How to Avoid Being an Obsessive Girlfriend3," Marriage is not on the cards on the first date and it may never be. Viewing yourself as ""Mrs Jones"" before you even know the other person is obsessive. Avoid trying to rush things too fast, avoid less-than-subtle mentions of biological clocks and how much you'd love to have children some day soon, and avoid making hints about getting engaged or what you'd wear at your dream wedding. For the sake of your relationship's healthiness, let it unfold in good time without the expectations of ""forever"". For all you know, it might turn out to be forever but equally, it might just be a wonderful relationship for this point-in-time; either way, trying to move things too fast will easily destroy it.


Be careful about giving gifts and when you give them. Gift giving can give the impression of an attempt to tie someone down if it occurs too early in a relationship. Moreover, giving something expensive too early can make some one feel uncomfortable and ""bound"" to you, and giving gifts which may be inappropriate will simply be embarrassing.

, When obsession drives you to keep calling and texting 24 hours a day, checking up on your partner, you've turned jail keeper and your lover is imprisoned. It's okay to call once and see how his or her day is, but if you're calling every couple of hours, this could reinforce his or her belief that you have nothing else going on in your life and surely you don't want to seem like you have nothing better to do? People are attracted to interesting people, not those at a loose end. If it becomes clear that the only thing you've got going in your life is him or her, then he or she will lose interest; it's too big a responsibility to make up for someone's lack of self-esteem. So, turn off that phone, shut yourself out of the email and IM, and find something else to occupy yourself with, like going for a walk, catching up with friend or family member, taking a nap, doing a workout or learning something new (see above).

, A lack of trust coupled with obsessive neediness might compel you to tail your lover. Nothing is more likely to turn him or her off you than this sort of behavior and if it seems threatening to your lover, you could find yourself being charged for stalking. Don't follow your partner anywhere that he or she claims to be going to––you will be noticed eventually and it sends an instant message that you don't trust him or her. For most relationships, stalking is the death knell.

, This is simple and very effective. After asking for time apart, set up a time and day to reconnect. For instance, if one of you wants to hang out with friends for the day, suggest that you meet up later for dinner. Or, suggest a time the following day, and an activity, in which the both of you could get together. This gives both people in the relationship permission to enjoy their time apart, while also giving each of you a grounding point, or rather a reassurance in knowing you will see the other person and they wish to see you.


Make sure that your desire to spend time apart does not turn into an argument. Spending time apart can turn into a sensitive topic, especially if the other person feels that it's an attempt to detach for good. Make it absolutely clear that this is about ensuring that both of you have time to enjoy as an individual so that time spent back together is refreshed and renewed.

, Surround your date time with activities either side, as well as regular commitments. This way you are restoring the balance to the time spent together rather than letting yourself just hang around endlessly, ignoring the things that really do need your attention. For instance, say you want to hang out with your date during the afternoon. Suggest a time and ask that your date drop you off at your house after the outing, making it clear that you've something else to be doing by that time. This prevents the date from running into overtime and lets both of you have freedom to do something more. It also allows each of you to open the dialogue about spending longer dates together where appropriate should the times you're setting seem too short. The best thing about endpoints is that neither of you end up feeling trapped but can actually look forward to the next time you'll spend together.

Never use a dog product on a cat or vice versa.",How to Prevent Flea Bites," Your veterinarian can give you flea control medications that are administered orally or by injection and are more likely to work than many over-the-counter brands. Some other treatments are topical solutions.


Try topical or spot-on medication. These medications absorb from the skin into the pet’s bloodstream. They are applied to a small area on the pet’s back directly on the skin. From there, they work to paralyze and kill fleas after they feed on the pet. Ingredients in these products vary and may include: fipronil, imidacloprid, metaflumizone, permethrin, pyriproxyfen, selamectin, and spinosad. NEVER use permethrins on cats.
Consider oral tablets. These are given once a month. Some of the tablets only stop the egg from developing into an adult, so another product will need to be used to kill adult fleas. There is also a quick-acting product will only kill fleas for 24 hours.
For cats, there is an injection available which will control fleas for up to 6 months. A veterinarian will need to give the injection. There is the potential for side effects. These include reactions to the injection at the site of injection, vomiting, and loss of appetite.
Treat all the pets in your house.
Be aware not all products sold to kill fleas are effective. You can purchase over-the-counter flea prevention drops or pills but these may not be effective in treating or preventing fleas. Take care to read the label instructions for proper dosage.;
, Fleas are usually at their worst from March to October, depending on where you live. They like warm, humid weather, preferring temperatures between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit and 75% humidity., Some collars are highly effective, but others are not. Effective collars, such as Seresto brand collars, require a veterinary prescription. Be cautious about collars that do not need a script as they are less likely to be effective. Always follows the directions on the package. When used with flea and tick shampoos they can be a good option for flea control. DO NOT use dog flea collars on cats.

, Give your pet some added protection from biting fleas by making your own flea collar. Mix two to three drops of cedar or lavender essential oil with one to two tablespoons of water. Drip some of this mixture onto a bandanna. Rub the sides of the bandanna fabric together to rub in the scent. Then tie the bandanna around your pet’s neck. , Add one teaspoon of all-natural apple cider vinegar to one quart of drinking water for your dog. This will deter fleas as the vinegar works its way through the dog’s bloodstream and is emitted through his skin., Brewer’s yeast has been known to repel fleas, especially in hot muggy climates. For a cat or small dog, add half a teaspoon of brewer’s yeast to the pet’s meal by sprinkling it over the food. Use one teaspoon if your dog is over 30 pounds, and add a teaspoon for every 30 pounds beyond that.

, While this may seem excessive, it's actually a vital part of removing fleas from your home. Since fleas lay eggs that may hatch after you've treated your pet, you need to remove the eggs and larvae that fall to the floor or on furniture. Vacuum every day for a few weeks to ensure that a new cycle of fleas won't trouble you.


Remember to throw the vacuum bag away in an outdoor dumpster or empty the bagless vacuum canister into the outdoor dumpster. If you leave the dirt in the vacuum bag or canister, the fleas can easily work their way back into your home.Eggs and fleas can also get trapped in fabric on couches, pet bedding and other upholstered furniture. Vacuum upholstery every day for a few weeks.

, Diatomaceous earth (DE) is a natural and safe alternative for killing fleas in your house. DE is similar in consistency to talcum powder.It can be sprinkled on carpets, baseboards, and other places in your house. Let it sit for a few days and then vacuum it up.

, This type of insecticide will restrict the growth of fleas and eggs. Check that the product will kill fleas/eggs for up to 7 months.


Strictly follow the instructions. Make sure to remove all pets from the area when you are applying this insecticide. Don't forget birds and other pets in cages. Be sure to also cover aquariums when using these products.

, Strip as much of the fabric off your couches, chairs, and bed as you can. Then, wash it in the hottest water your fabric will allow. This should kill fleas and their eggs.Gather up any clothes that may be lying around, especially piles of laundry. Fleas will nest in fabrics. Washing and drying on the hottest setting possible will kill fleas and eggs.

, Fleas don’t like the scent of lemon and will avoid things with this smell. By applying a lemon spray around your house and on your pets, you can drive the fleas away, at least temporarily.


Make a lemon citrus spray by cutting 6 lemons in half and boiling them in water. Steep the lemons in the water overnight. Pour the lemon water into a clean spray bottle. Place in a spray bottle and apply to fabrics and furniture around your house. You can also spritz your animals with lemon spray.Test inconspicuous areas first to make sure it doesn’t bleach or damage the item being sprayed.

, Set up several diffusers throughout your house. Choose oils such as lavender, eucalyptus, cedar wood, lemon, or peppermint.You can also look for lotions that contain these essential oils. Apply the lotion to your skin, which will repel the fleas.

, Most general bug sprays prevent against fleas, so apply the spray if you notice fleas in your house. One with an insect growth inhibitor will be longer lasting killing any fleas which hatch for up to 7 months.Consider the health hazards of insecticides. Always read labels carefully to avoid accidental poisoning., If it's flea season, spraying insecticide in your yard will kill off fleas and eggs. Look for a product that's been approved by the EPA and is safe to use on your plants., Nematodes are small worms that feed on fleas. Ladybugs are also good additions to your yard, as they feed on fleas as well. Visit your local garden center to get some of these flea predators., A flea comb is a very fine-toothed comb easily found in pet supply stores, the pet aisle in discount stores, or at a veterinary office. Work the comb down to the pet’s skin and slowly comb through the fur. If there are fleas, you'll see small black flakes or even fleas as you pull the comb through the fur. , When you're at home, spend some time wearing white socks. This will make it easier to spot fleas. If you notice a bunch of tiny black spots on your socks, this may be a sign of a flea infestation. These might show up as actual fleas that may jump on your ankles and feet, or these specks may also be flea dirt., You may notice your pet scratching or furiously nibbling at itself if it's being bothered by fleas.

, If you have flea bites, you might have small pink and red bumps or spots which may be itchy.You might find flea bites at the fold of a joint, such as at your elbow, knee or ankle.
These bumps will turn white when you press on them.

, If you haven't already, talk to your vet about treatment options for your pet. These may include topical treatments, oral medication, or injections. These will kill the fleas on your pet and prevent reinfestation.


Again, keep in mind that not all of these treatments work. Talk to your vet about the best treatment for your pets.

, This can kill the fleas that are currently on your pet, though it will not prevent them or do anything if there are fleas in the environment that jump back on to your pet. Look for a pet shampoo or dip that will kill fleas, larvae, and eggs.


Take extra care to wash your pet’s head after you've washed his body. Fleas might try jumping onto the head to avoid being washed.
Be sure to follow the directions for use and frequency and completely rinse the product off of your pet.DO NOT use dog shampoo or dips on cats.
Keep in mind that these types of product will cleanse the pet, but they do not have persistent action to stop the pet from becoming reinfected. You must use another product (such as a spot-on treatment or collar) to prevent reinfestation.

, Flea sprays and powders, available at pet stores, are applied to the pet’s fur. They may need to be worked in to reach the skin to kill the adult fleas.


Follow the instructions on the package for proper use.

, Flea control products are specially formulated for use on a certain type of pet. They are not interchangeable. Do not use a dog-formulated product on your cat, and vice versa.

Apply the medication.,
Massage your pet’s ears.,
Wipe away any excess.,
Repeat the treatment.,
Wash your pet’s bedding.,
Wash any bedding and any other blankets your pet comes into contact with.,
Spray your pet’s bedding.",How to Treat Ear Mites," The inside of the ear will be red and irritated; however, while a red irritated ear can be a sign of ear mites, that in and of itself isn’t a definitive symptom. If you don’t see any other ear-mite symptoms or have any doubt, see your vet.Not all red and irritated ear canals are due to ear mites. Ear infections involving bacteria and yeast are quite common, particularly in dogs. These ear infections will not respond to ear mite treatment.
Your veterinarian can determine the whether ear mites are involved and, if they are not, prescribe the appropriate remedy for your pet. Treating your pet with the wrong product may do more harm than good.;
, If you suspect your pet has ear mites, you may be able to see the parasite with your naked eye.


Carefully remove a small sample of the dark brown/black debris (it should look like coffee grounds) from the ear canal with a cotton ball.You may need to add a few drops of mineral oil to the material in the ear and massage to help loosen it up to get a sample.
Your pet may shake its head after you’ve placed the mineral oil in its ear and likely some chunks will fly out. You can then inspect those samples.
Look at the sample material in bright light and see if you can find tiny white “dots.” They may even move. Those are likely ear mites. If you can't see any in a bright light, try again in low light — it may be harder for you to see, but mites hide from light, so they may not be visible under the bright light.

, The best way to know for sure that your pet has ear mites is to have your veterinarian do an exam and look at a sample of the material from the ear canal under the microscope.


Note that cats are far more prone to ear mites than dogs, but dogs can occasionally get them, particularly if there is a cat in the same household that has mites.
The vet may place long-acting ear mite medication in your pet’s ears for you and send you home with something to help with the itching. It is not uncommon for a secondary bacterial or yeast infection to be present with the ear mites, so medication to treat that may be sent home as well.

, The medication used for ear mites is a pesticide designed to kill the mites. Be sure to read the manufacturer's instructions before proceeding, as they will provide important information about how much medication to apply.


Don’t use ear mite medication in your pet’s ears if your pet has pupils of different sizes or has a head tilt they cannot correct on their own. If this is the case, there is a good chance that the eardrum is ruptured, and you don’t want to place anything inside the ears that will make things worse. Consult your veterinarian right away.

, Medication works best if the ears are clean before it is applied. Therefore, take the time to clean any build up out of your pets ears.Use a few drops of mineral oil in the ear canal; it will help break up the crumbly material when you massage the ear canal.Use a cotton ball to wipe out debris after your pet shakes its head.
After you clean its ears, your pet may try to scratch the ear. Do your best to prevent the scratching by using a towel to block your pet’s ability to reach its ears. An Elizabethan collar (aka e-collar) may be needed temporarily to protect your pet from self-trauma.

, Begin by holding the pet's head firmly in your hand, which will prevent the pet from shaking its head and dispersing the medication as you’re trying to apply it.Tip the bottle or vial over and insert the applicator tip carefully into the ear.
Squeeze the bottle until the proper amount of medication is deposited.
The medication is more effective if you apply it deep into the ear canal.
Note that your pet will probably shake its head after application, so you may want to administer the treatment outdoors or in the bathroom or laundry room to prevent the medication from getting on your furniture.

, Once you have placed ear medication in the first ear, start massaging right away while you place medication in the second ear.Gently squeeze the ear closed and use your fingers to massage the medicine thoroughly in the ear. Massage by using your thumb and forefinger on either side of the canal, just below the opening to the ear canal. Open and close your fingers together and you will hear a squishing sound.
Most of the time, massaging the first ear keeps the pet occupied quite nicely so you can get to the second ear relatively calmly.
Although one person can accomplish this treatment, it always helps to have another set of hands at the ready just in case.

, If there’s any excess medication, wipe it away gently with a clean towel.


This step is particularly helpful if you’re concerned about your pet getting medication on carpets or furniture.

, It is unlikely that you will kill all of the mites in one treatment. Follow the medication’s instructions. Typically, you will treat the mites once daily for seven days., Ear mites are contagious, especially to other pets. It is important to wash your pet’s bedding in order to keep your pet from getting reinfected and from infecting any other pets you might have.


Use hot soapy water to wash your pet’s bedding.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions! Some bedding can simply be thrown in the washing machine, while others must be washed by hand.

, While ear mites don’t live long when not inside your pet’s ear, it is best to make sure all your bedding and blankets are clean and ear mite free. Wash them in hot soapy water.

, There are products available meant to kill fleas, ticks, and mites on household surfaces. If you are still worried about mites infecting your pets bedding, spray them with a product that will be sure to kill them.

Be wary of flea collars.,
Ask your vet for a spot-on medication.,
Consider getting an oral flea medication from your veterinarian.,
See if your local groomer or vet will do a flea bath for your pet.",How to Rid Your Pet of Fleas1," Many flea collars are ineffective and some contain organophosphates which are potentially toxic to the pet. The only collar that is both effective and safe is the Seresto collar, available from your vet.;
, “Spot-on” treatments are applied directly to your pet's skin to kill fleas quickly. Many of these monthly treatments should be used year round as a preventative treatment. Be aware that just because a product is a 'spot-on' doesn't mean it is effective. It is essential to use a flea product with is licensed to kill fleas, which means that it is proven to be beneficial. If in doubt speak to your veterinarian. Make sure that the product you choose is labeled for your pet. Cats can get very sick (or even die) if they are treated with a flea medication that is meant for dogs. Frontline will kill rabbits.Some common flea medications include:Permethrine: Many products for dogs contain permethrine alone or in combination with other drugs, to effectively treat fleas in dogs.It is not safe for use with all pets, and it can cause health problems in both humans and dogs.
Dinotefuran and pyriproxyfen (known as Vectra) is used to treat fleas in cats. Be careful: Vectra 3D is a product for dogs. Vectra 3D contains permethrin, which is harmful to cats.Fipronil and (S)-methoprene (known as Frontline Plus for Cats): This product kills flea larvae, eggs, and adult fleas. It also kills ticks and chewing lice.Imidacloprid and pyriproxyfen (known as Advantage II): This product kills fleas of all life stages. Be sure not to get a similarly named product, Advantix II, which is a product for dogs. It contains permethrin, which is harmful to cats.Selamectin (known as Revolution): Apply this once a month. It also kills ticks, heartworms, ear mites, and sarcoptic mites.Be careful about what chemicals you are using. Products like Advantage manufactured by Bayer contain neonicotinoids which have been shown to have serious ecological impacts including contributing to the wide spread loss of bees around the world., Oral products usually act quickly and don't leave any residue. They're only available through your vet, who can recommend the best product. Many of these monthly treatments should be used year round as a preventative treatment. These medications may include:Lufenuron (known as Program): This comes as tablets, an oral suspension liquid, or injections. Give this medication with food once a month. Be aware that Program does not kill fleas but sterilizes them, making them incapable of breeding. If you have a heavy flea infestation then this is not the best product for you, as you will have to wait for the fleas to die of old age. It's best use is in a clean household when you don't want the odd visiting flea to establish a family.Nitenpyram (known as Capstar): This comes as a pill. Give it to your pet according to your veterinarian's directions to kill adult fleas and their eggs.Spinosad (known as Comfortis): This comes as chewable tablets, which you should give your pet with food once a month to kill fleas., Many veterinarians and groomers will provide this service. For smaller pets, it is recommended that you see a veterinarian and not a groomer. A groomer is unlikely to be equipped to help treat a bird with fleas. Be aware that after the bath, once the pet is dry, there is nothing to deter more fleas from jumping back on the pet.

Look for changes in their feathers.,
Check their beak.,
Monitor their droppings for texture and discoloration.,
Watch them to see if their breathing is labored.,
Seek immediate attention for injuries or critical symptoms.",How to Spot Signs of Illness in Lovebirds1," Feathers are often a conspicuous sign of illness in birds. Not preening, consistently ruffled feathers, areas with thin or no feathers, matted feathers, excessive molting, rapid changes in color, and picking out feathers can all be signs of illness in lovebirds.Any of these symptoms individually is concerning. If you notice even one of these, contact your avian vet immediately.;
, Problems with the beak can indicate any number of problems, including the critical Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD).Check to see if the beak is overgrown, flaky, loses symmetry, discolored, or if there is discharge around the nares.If you suspect your bird may have PBFD, isolate them from any other birds immediately and make an appointment with your vet, as this disease is highly contagious.

, Abnormal droppings could be signs of a serious illness, including PBFD and Chlamydiosis. Look for discoloration in droppings, especially green or yellow colors, an abnormally thick or runny consistency, and a major increase or decrease in the number of daily droppings., Respiratory illnesses are one of the more common problems in lovebirds, so you need to watch their breathing carefully when you check for signs of illness. Difficulty breathing, breathing through an open beak, wheezing, trouble breathing while flying, and sneezing could all indicate respiratory problems.Difficulty breathing is a critical symptom in most birds. If you notice any respiratory symptoms contact your avian vet immediately or take your lovebird to your closest animal hospital.

, If you notice any burns, bite wounds, bleeding, vomiting, seizures, rapid weight loss, lumps or swelling in the body or on the feet, consistent tail bobbing, or if your bird falls off its perch, seek immediate vet attention. These are critical symptoms that indicate that your bird needs immediate medical attention."

Use just water.,
Use dish soap in a bath to kill fleas.,
Get a flea shampoo.,
Rinse thoroughly.",How to Rid Your Pet of Fleas2," For some pets, such as guinea pigs, it is not possible to use many of the flea treatments available. In this case, a simple bath may be your only option. By bathing the pet in warm, not hot, water, you're trying to drown the fleas. This won't likely kill any eggs left, and it may be necessary to comb your pet, as well as repeat this bath.


Since the fleas will run to the head and face of your pet once you start wetting them, it is best to wet and lather up only the neck first then the rest of your pet. This will create a barrier to prevent the fleas from invading your pet's face and ears.
Use room temperature or slightly warm water, so as not to shock or harm your pet.
Stop the bath with small pets that get too stressed out. Animals like rabbits and guinea pigs can die from fear-induced heart-attacks., Though it may cause some skin dryness and/or irritation, dish soap can be effective at killing fleas. The soap is toxic to fleas, and can be used as a way to control the infestation. Make sure to rinse your pet thoroughly.

, These are shampoos that are specially designed to treat fleas in specific animals. Find one formulated for your pet. Make sure to follow the instructions provided exactly, to prevent any injury to your pet.

, Always rinse thoroughly. Residue from flea treatments can irritate your pets skin, and possibly lead to harm. By taking the time to rinse all the soap, shampoo, or herbal treatment from your pet, you will help to remove fleas, as well as ensure leftover residue doesn't cause your pet more discomfort.

Make sure the products you're using are safe for your pet.",How to Rid Your Pet of Fleas3," A variety of powders are available for different animals, using different chemicals at different concentrations. It is important to talk to your vet before using these products, so as to be sure it is safe for your pet. These have largely been superseded now by other options for flea control. One disadvantage of powders is that they can be inhaled, which is not healthy for you or the animal. These powders can be useful when a bath is not possible.

, For birds with fleas, this may be a good option. Mixing diatomaceous earth with sand and providing it to birds can encourage them to dust themselves with it. You may also dust the bird yourself. Make sure to use a mask when handling DE. Though it is not harmful to birds, it can cause skin and lung irritation to humans., Because there are a variety of dusting products available, not all will be suitable for use on all animals. Some may kill or injure your pet. Each animal will have different tolerances to different products, so make sure ask a vet about the active ingredients in your treatment.

Get a flea comb or tight-toothed comb.,
Keep a bucket of water nearby.,
Comb out the fleas always in the direction of fur or hair growth.,
Take your time.,
Repeat this every couple of days.,
Be aware that the fleas only hop onto the pet to feed and mostly live in the environment - thus it takes a long time to bring an infestation under control by combing.

",How to Rid Your Pet of Fleas4," Because fleas grip tightly to hair and fur, and their eggs can be tightly attached as well, a tight comb must be used to remove them. There are combs specially designed for this purpose. Make sure the teeth of your comb are the right length and tightness for your pet.

, This will allow you to drown any fleas you comb out. It will also help to wet your pet as you comb, helping to control the movements of any fleas. Make sure the water is warm, but not hot.

, Go from root to tip, and from head to tail. This is an especially important technique when combing out fleas. Fleas like to hold on by the root. If you do not comb up the entire length of the hair, you are likely to miss some., It may seem tedious, but the time you put into manually removing the fleas can pay off. This can be a very effective measure in controlling and eliminating your pet's flea problem. Don't rush through combing your pet, or it might lengthen the treatment process.

, Comb your pet for fleas more than once. It will give you an opportunity to monitor you pet for new fleas, as well as check the condition of their skin. Look not only for fleas, but check for signs of irritation or injury from treatment.

Act quickly.,
Treat your pet's environment.,
Vacuum and/or steam clean.,
Wash all linens.,
Avoid letting your pet on the furniture.,
Spray floors and bedding with an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR).",How to Rid Your Pet of Fleas5," The speed of kill is very important to managing and eliminating fleas. Don't let a flea problem run unchecked. The longer you wait to treat it, the worse it will become, and the harder it will be to remove all the fleas. Taking care of a flea problem as soon as you notice it is vital to treating your pet's problem., Carpets and area rugs are the areas inside the home that are most likely to become infested. Look for an environmentally friendly borate-derivative powder to apply to your carpets that will prevent fleas from infesting. Clean their crate or bed. Treat any area they spend time in. For small animals, clean the cage or tank and any toys with hot, soapy water. Dispose of any bedding such as wood shavings or newspaper.

, Because fleas can survive in your house, away from their host, for quite some time, it is important to vacuum frequently. Steam cleaning is also an excellent way to treat your home for fleas, as the steam will kill them. Make sure to do one or both of these things the entire length of treatment and after.


Keeping everything cleaned and washed will help prevent fleas. If you do, the fleas won't have the time or space necessary to live and breed.
Dispose of the vacuum bag afterward to prevent reinfestation.
Vacuum cleaners can kill fleas as well as chemical treatments., Fleas can hide in bedding, towels, and clothing. Make sure to wash everything in hot water, to kill fleas and their eggs. Wash drapery and pillows too, as these can also harbor fleas. Soak your pet's bed in hot, soapy water for at least 15 minutes; wash, rinse, and let dry, or dry with a towel. This breaks down the fleas' waxy coating, and they will dehydrate and die.

, If your pet gets fleas, you do not want them to spread it to your entire house. Remember, fleas can live for several months in your furniture, and will quickly 'invade' your pet again given the chance. By keeping your pet off the furniture, you can help control the spread of fleas.

, IGRs, such as Nylar, stop the fleas from developing, thereby breaking the reproduction cycle. This is a blessing when attempting to bring large infestations under control. The most economical method is to buy a concentrate and mix according to the directions that come with the product.


Typically, the application will need to be done twice, at a minimum—about three and a half weeks apart. Often it is advantageous to spray the areas of the house frequented by your pets on a monthly basis during flea season.
IGRs are not poisonous to mammals. This makes IGRs a good option around a house that has kids or small animals such as hamsters.

Watch for changes in your bird’s attitude.,
Monitor the amount of food and water they consume.,
Check for changes in their posture and positioning.,
Look at where they are in their cage.,
Track their movements.",How to Spot Signs of Illness in Lovebirds2," Just like people, lovebirds can get depressed or anxious when they don’t feel well. If your bird seems withdrawn, shows little interest in fly time, sleeps a lot, or gets overly nervous or excited when someone enters the room, it could be a sign that they feel sick., Both a decrease or a sudden increase in thirst or appetite could be signs that your bird is sick, and may be indicators of nutritional disorders, a common problem in lovebirds. Pay close attention to how much your lovebird eats and drinks on a daily basis. If you notice a sudden change, contact your vet for recommendation on treatment., If your bird has drooping wings, frequently tucks their head, or huddles, it could be a sign that they don’t feel well. Behavioral symptoms such as these are typically considered critical, and require a vet visit immediately., Sitting on the cage floor or holding onto the cage with their beak instead of sitting comfortably on a perch are two major indicators that something is wrong. If your bird is unable to perch normally, contact an avian vet immediately for recommendations and to see if an appointment may be necessary., When a bird doesn’t move around much in its cage, it can be an indicator of stress or a larger health problem. If you notice your bird staying on a single perch or sitting for long periods at their food or water dish, they may be exhibiting symptoms of a serious illness."
"
Isolate the bird.,
Take your bird to an avian vet.,
Reduce stress around the bird.,
Provide supplemental heat.,
Clean their cages daily.",How to Spot Signs of Illness in Lovebirds3," If you have multiple birds, it is best to move a bird that isn’t feeling well into another cage in a different room. This helps reduce stress for your sick bird, and helps stop contagious diseases from spreading to your healthy birds., Sick birds need special care from a vet that focuses on treating birds, commonly called an avian vet. If you think your lovebird may be sick, call your local avian vet immediately to make an appointment.If you think your bird is critically sick, ask for recommendations for an animal hospital if your vet can’t see you immediately.
Ask the vet about what steps and precautions you should take with the bird for the time in between your call and your appointment.

, Stress can cause the onset or worsening of some diseases in birds. Reduce stress by keeping perches low, making sure food and water are easy to reach, minimizing handling, and allowing a quiet space for your bird to rest., Unless your bird is running a fever, supplemental heat is necessary as birds lose body heat rapidly when sick. Use a heat lamp to provide your bird with an environment around 80° to 85° F (26°-29° C).Natural sunlight is also important to help ward off vitamin D deficiencies. Place your bird in an area with access to natural light, or use full-spectrum lamps to provide the UVA and UVB rays they need., Help eliminate bacteria that can grow in dirty cages by removing old cage liner or paper and rinsing out food and water dishes with soap and hot water daily. Additionally, the cage and all toys, dishes, and accessories should be disinfected using a purpose-made birdcage disinfectant once a week.Remember to allow the disinfectant to dry completely before rinsing it away with hot water. The cage and equipment should then be allowed to dry again before returning your lovebird to its home.

Give your pet puzzle toys.,
Provide your pet with chew toys.,
Keep a steady rotation of toys for your pet.",How to Keep Your Pet Occupied when You Are Not at Home1," Toys are one of the best ways to keep your pet occupied when you are not home. Not only do they help him pass the time, but they also keep him physically and mentally stimulated, which is good for his overall health. Puzzle toys, which are available at your local pet store, are toys inside which you hide food.


Since animals like to work for their food,puzzle toys are a great way to keep your pet busy.
One of the most popular puzzles toys is the KONG® toy, which is extremely durable and ideal for dogs. Other popular puzzle toys are the Buster® Cube and Tricky Treat™ Balls.Stuff the puzzle toy with such tasty foods— peanut butter or cottage cheese for dogs,and tasty treats for your cat. You could also stuff the toy with one of your pet's regular meals.Stuff the puzzle toy with food and put it in the freezer overnight to make the food last even longer.You may want to let the toy thaw a little bit before giving it to your pet so it isn’t too cold inside his mouth.
Your dog or cat may need some time to get used to puzzle toy if he’s never used one before. Choose a toy that has big holes and make the food easy for him to get out. As he gets better, challenge him by placing larger chunks food in a toy with smaller holes.;
, Dogs, especially puppies, are notorious for chewing on things they shouldn’t. Without a proper ‘chew’ outlet or other activities to keep him busy, your dog could chew on your furniture—or maybe even your favorite shoes! Examples of good chew toys for dogs are natural marrow bones and hard rubber toys.Chew toys keep your dog’s jaws strong and his teeth clean. Chew toys are also good for relieving anxiety. In fact, the act of chewing has a calming effect on dogs.It is important that the chew toy be made of a durable material, such as hard rubber. You wouldn’t want your dog to chew on something that could make him sick if he ends up tearing it apart and swallowing it.Since chewing is a natural activity for wild birds, your bird would enjoy a chew toy or two. Examples of bird chew toys are baskets and vine balls.The baskets should be made of untreated material, such as natural seagrass or bamboo. Look for vine balls at your local pet store., As much as your pet will love to play with his toys, he’s probably going to get bored with them at some point. To delay the boredom (and maybe save you a little money), keep the toys you have in a steady rotation. Leave out a few toys at a time, then rotate them out each week.To add more variety, leave out different types of toys. For example, give your pet a chew toy and puzzle toy during each rotation.

Ride a horse that is experienced and trained well.,
Mount your horse and get settled in the saddle, holding the reins in one hand.

,
Tap your heels on his sides and click your tongue.,
When ready to turn, bring the reins forward on his neck and just as you did at a halt, pull the reins towards the side you're turning to.,
Use the same method for both directions, just switch which rein you pull.

",How to Turn a Horse1,"


Before learning how to turn a horse, you should know how to ride a horse to begin with. You should be able to mount and sit on a horse comfortably.
When riding Western, the horse you are riding will be a neck-reining horse. This means the horse will respond to the reins on his neck instead of the reins pulling at his mouth. Learn how to move the reins against the horses neck. To do this, you pull the reins gently to the right or left. (If to the right, the left rein will lay against the horse's neck and the right reins will not and vice versa.) The horse should turn his head if at a standstill. Some horses will even start walking if you turn them at a halt.;
,, Your horse should start walking.

, Your horse should turn his head and start turning. Keep the reins there until you're completely turned the way you want to be. Continue on.

Give your pet something to listen to.,
Create a ‘fun zone’ for your pet.,
Enrich your bird’s cage.,
Add some variety to your fish’s tank.",How to Keep Your Pet Occupied when You Are Not at Home2," In addition to toys, making your pet’s home environment more interesting can keep him occupied when you’re not home. For example, leave music on for him when you leave the house. Classical music works well for dogs and cats.Choose music that is soothing, such as music with a piano or stringed instruments. Music with loud or percussive instruments, like trumpets or drums, could get your pet worked up.Talk radio is another option. Just make sure it doesn’t involve people shouting at each other.For birds, you could play a CD of bird calls or other natural sounds. Make sure the bird calls are not coming from birds of prey—this could agitate your bird.Consider leaving your television on for your pet. This can be especially entertaining for pet birds, since they could learn to mimic human speech.As with the radio and other music, keep the TV on a channel without loud or agitating noises.

, A ‘fun zone’ is a specific area that is full of fun things for your pet to do during the day. This area does not need to be a separate room. It could be a corner of a room, or maybe just a particular window.For your bird, you could construct a play stand in his cage to keep his toy stash (e.g, foraging toys, shredding toys).Potential items for your cat’s fun zone are a multi-level cat tree,a windowsill perch,and scratching posts.Putting a bird feeder outside the window could keep your cat entertained for hours when she sits on her perch.Along with some of your dog’s favorite toys, place a homemade ‘busy bucket’ in your dog’s fun zone. In a sturdy plastic or aluminum bucket, make repeating layers of treats, toys, then a towel. Your dog will have fun sifting through the bucket and playing with (and eating) what he finds., Other than the play stand, there are different ways to enrich your bird’s cage. For example, you can place different types of perches in his cage. Pick perches of varying diameters, from 1/2 inch to 5/8 inches.Select perches made of different textures and materials to keep his feet healthy.If your bird has a long tail, place the perches high enough to prevent his tail from rubbing against the cage wires.Consider moving the perches around occasionally to give your bird a chance to look at something different in your home.Mirrors can be another good addition to your bird’s cage. Be aware, though, that your bird may end up bonding with the mirror instead of you., If you have a fish, you may not have given much thought to keeping him busy during the day. Adding some variety and changing things around can give your fish something new to explore in his tank when you are not home. For example, you could change the location of some of items in his tank,like the plants and caves.


You could also add some new items to his tank,or replace some of the old ones. To keep your fish healthy, make sure the items are nontoxic.They should also be free of sharp edges that could damage his fins.

"
"
Find a playmate for your pet.,
Hire a pet sitter.,
Add more fish to your fish’s tank.",How to Keep Your Pet Occupied when You Are Not at Home3," Your pet may enjoy having a playmate around when you are not at home. This would give him a chance to have playful social interactions during the day, and get some exercise.


Giving your bird a cage mate could help him pass the time more easily. Be mindful, though, that the birds may end up interacting with each other more than with you.
For your cat, having a feline playmate would give her the chance to stay more active and even invent new games.If adopting another cat or dog is not practical for you, consider scheduling a playdate with a neighbor who has a cat or dog. Assuming the pets are compatible, your neighbor could come by when you are not home to give your pet someone to play with.Be selective when choosing a playmate for your pet. That playmate should be energetic, playful, and able to get along with your pet. Keep in mind that older dogs and cats may not adjust well to having another pet around.

, If adopting another pet or scheduling playdates will not work for you, consider hiring a pet sitter. During the day, the pet sitter could take your dog for a walk, play with your cat, etc.You can set the parameters of what the pet sitter would do, based on your pet’s age, activity level, and health condition.


Ask your veterinarian or other pet owners for recommendations on reputable pet sitters in your area.

, Adding fish to your tank could encourage your fish to interact positively with other fish.Of course, this is not necessarily as simple as just picking some fish at the store and placing them in your tank at home. Do your research to learn what species of fish are compatible with the fish that you have.


Before adding fish to your tank, make sure it is large enough to accommodate more fish. Research the minimum tank size required for your species of fish, as well as the species of fish you are considering adding to the tank.

",How to Turn a Horse2,"


Before learning how to turn a horse, you should know how to ride a horse to begin with. You should be able to mount and sit on a horse comfortably.
When riding English, the horse you are riding will be a head-reining horse. This means the horse will respond to the bit in his mouth more the the reins on his neck. Learn how to move the reins at his head. To do this, you pull the reins gently to the right or left. The horse should turn his head if at a standstill. Some horses will even start walking if you turn them at a halt.

,, Your horse should start walking.

Start in the right place.,
Start with your horse a few feet away from you, wiggle the lunge line at them till they back away.,
Do not move on until you are effective at backing your horse away from you, While teaching this make sure that you reward for even one step by dropping the rope to the ground, after your horse backs one step every time that you barely wiggle the rope then start to ask for two steps and continue to gradually increase the amount of steps.

,
When you can back your horse away from you all the way to the end of the line, do so.,
Gradually increase the time that you ask them to stay put and the distance that you venture while they are there.

",How to Teach Your Horse to Stand," Have your horse on a lunge line in an area that they feel comfortable and that has little distractions for them.;
, Start with a little wiggle and increase to thrashing the rope back and forth if they do not back within a short amount of time. As soon as the horse takes one step backdrop the lunge line to the ground. Let them sit for a moment. Pick up the rope and try again. (Parelli calls this the Yo Yo game.)

,, Drop the rope to the ground turn to walk away but keep an eye on your horse, if they move pick up the rope and wiggle it till they were where you had them originally, sit for a moment until your horse is settled again. Begin to walk away, continue to correct each time that your horse moves by putting them right back where they started.

Use a biological filter.A biological filter uses bacteria to remove organic waste that can accumulate in your pond.,
Clean your pump’s filters out regularly.Most filters require cleaning once each week.,
Manually clean your pond.The cheapest but most time-consuming method of removing algae is to go out each day, or every few days, and check for algae.,
Feed your fish properly.Feeding your fish properly involves choosing the right feed and feeding in the right amounts.,
Introduce a moving water fixture.,
Add barley straw to your pond.As barley straw decomposes, it releases a chemical that prevents algae from growing.,
Add plants to the pond.You could add both floating plants and submerged plants to your pond.",How to Care for Your Pond1," You could get an in-pond filter or an external filter.In-pond filters have a pump attached to a fountain that runs into the pond. While they are easy to set up and install, they are difficult to clean because you must remove the entire contraption from the pond.
External filters are very easy to clean, but it can be difficult to get the right size and pump, since they are usually designed for pools, not ponds.
While these bacteria occur naturally in ponds, they are not present in the quantities necessary to adequately filter all the toxins that occur in most ponds.
Get a filter capable of filtering about twice the amount of water that our pond contains. For instance, if a filter says it can adequately filter 3,000 liters, you should use it only if your pond is around 1,500 liters or less. If you get a filter that matches your pond’s volume exactly, it will struggle to keep the pond clean.
Your filter should filter your entire pond in about two hours. Check the speed of the pump and compare it to your pond’s volume to choose the right one.;
, Usually, cleaning is a simple matter of removing the filter, spraying it down with a hose, and replacing it.However, you should always follow manufacturer instructions when deciding how and how often to clean your filter.


If you notice your pump leaking or struggling noisily, you probably need to clean it.If your filter has a gauge on it, clean it when the back-pressure reaches four to five pounds.
Failure to clean your filter regularly will result in it working less efficiently, and leave your pond dirty.

, If you see any, use a rake or a long stick to remove it directly from the water. If you choose to employ this method, you must be vigilant and check the pond on a regular basis.


Remove leaves and debris floating on the water. Most leaves, twigs, seeds, and loose grasses can be removed with a pond skimmer, a kind of long-handled net specifically designed to keep ponds and pools clean.These are readily available at most home care stores.
Clean the bottom of the pond.You can use a pond vacuum or a wet vacuum to clean the bottom. A pond vacuum is a device that allows you to suck up leaves, algae, sludge, and other debris that you don’t want in the bottom of your pond. They are readily available at most home improvement stores.

, If you have fish in your pond, selecting a high-quality fish feed will prevent the growth of algae, as the food will be more fully digested, and your fish will produce less waste. In order to ensure your fish eat all the food they’re given, check for food floating on the surface about twenty minutes after you’re done feeding them.


If you see food bits still floating in the water, you’ll know that you’re overfeeding and should gradually reduce the amount of feed you’re providing to a level where you do not see feed floating on the surface after feeding is complete. Excess food will rot and give algae nutrients it can use to grow.
The type of feed you choose to give your fish depends on the species, though most commercially available feeds are appropriate for multiple species. Talk to the proprietor of your local pet store or your vet if you have questions about what type of feed is best for your fish.
Reduce the amount of feed you give your fish in autumn and winter. During these seasons, their metabolism slows and they’ll require less food., With moving water, your pond will be less likely to accrue algae and grime. You could add a fountain or waterfall to your pond. With either fixture, ensure it is placed next to the pond so that water will return to it. Fountains could be placed in the middle of the pond if the pond’s depth does not exceed the height of the fountain.


If you install a fountain or waterfall less than three feet high, the pump should be located next to the waterfall on the ground level. If you install a waterfall five feet tall or taller, the filter should be placed just behind the waterfall at an elevation equal to its highest point., One bale of barley straw treats 1,000 gallons of water. In other words, if your pond holds 100 gallons, you’d need only one-tenth of a bale. The best way to add the straw is to wrap a softball-sized portion of straw in mesh netting and toss the balled-up straw in the pond.


Alternatively, you could add liquid barley straw. One tablespoon usually treats about 50 gallons. If you don’t notice a change after about a week, add more gradually.
Barley straw is readily available at most garden centers.
Barley straw is safe for use in ponds with fish.

, Both will keep algae at bay and keep your pond clean in a natural way.


Add floating plants. Lillies and lotus reduce the total surface area of the pond that algae can thrive on, and absorb nutrients that algae would otherwise use to grow.
Submerged plants like hornwort, parrot’s feather, and anacharis add oxygen to the water, preventing algae. They can be kept below the water’s surface by attaching them to a rock or putting them in a plant pot and adding weight until it sinks.

Set up the pond.,
Choose the plants.,
Plant the chosen plants.,
Fill the pond with water.,
Make the perimeter of the pond interesting to look at and easy to access.,
Keep the pond fertilised.,
Get the kids to help.",How to Grow an Edible Pond," It should be large enough to add the plants but not so large that its upkeep will be a hassle. The surrounding area should also be considered when assessing where to place the pond.


Locate the pond in a sunny spot. The plants will need sunlight to grow well, and count on ensuring at least five hours of sunshine a day.






Keep the pond away from trees that drop their leaves or flowers in large amounts. These can clog up the pond.





;
, The kinds of plants suitable for both growing in a pond and for eating include:


Rainbow parsley (Oenanthe Javanica 'Pink Flamingo') – This plant is a perennial. It grows 30 centimeter (11.8 in) in height and spreads. It has a carrot and celery taste and is great for salad and soup. It is important to be very sure that you have the right species, as some Oenanthe are poisonous.






Lebanese Stonecress (Aehtionema Cordifolium) – This grows to around 15 centimeter (5.9 in) and needs to be carefully kept under control to prevent it taking over the pond. It has a cucumber taste and is great for salad and soup.






Taro (Colocasia Esculenta) – This is also known as ""Elephant Ear"". Both the corm and stem can be eaten; it must be cooked to destroy toxins present in its raw state. It's ideal roasted and added to soup or stew.






Water parsnip (Berula Erecta) – This will grow 30 centimeter (11.8 in) to 1 meter (3.3 ft) in height and creeps. It tastes like parsnip or carrot and is good for salad or soup.






Chinese water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) – This will grow about 30 centimeter (11.8 in) to 1 meter (3.3 ft) leaves in summer and die back to a corm in winter. Eat the corms raw or in a stir-fry.






Kangkong (Ipomoea aquatica) – This is water spinach. It grows best in the warm weather. Add the leaves and steams to salad or stir-fries.







Watercress (Nasturtium Officianale) – This grows fast and well. It can be added to salad, soup, sandwiches and as a garnish.






Water mint (Mentha aquatica) – This grows to about 1 meter (3.3 ft) in height. Use as you would use for mint.







, Keep the plants in their original pots unless it is suggested that they can be grown direct in the pond. This allows you to move them easily and to control the more rapid growers.


Fill each plastic pot halfway with potting mix. Push the soil down.






Put the plant in.






Infill the remaining gap with more potting mix and gently press down.






Spread a layer of fine gravel over the top of the soil. This will help to keep the pond clean.







, Stop about 10cm (4"") from the top. Arrange the plants in the pond as wished.


Use large pebbles to keep plants in place (some might try to float otherwise).






The top growth of the plant should not be submerged; allow it to grow above the waterline.







, Adding paving stones is a good idea, along with some attractive plants.

, You could add fish, whose waste provides a natural fertiliser. If not, choose a suitable water fertiliser that will slowly release.

, If you have kids, the water pond provides a fascinating alternative gardening project that allows them to get their hands wet and get edible food. It's a good garden for kids who don't really like getting their hands dirty in the soil!

Add water treatments.Water treatments are chemical formulas designed to block or remove algae.,
Add calcium sulfate.,
Get an ultraviolet (UV) clarifier.UV clarifiers are special pumps that pull pond water into a chamber where the water is exposed to ultraviolet light.",How to Care for Your Pond2," They are typically safe for use with fish and invertebrates like snails, but will harm tadpoles. Specific directions for use vary with the particular product you choose to use in your pond. Always follow manufacturer directions when adding water treatments to your pond.


Water treatments will need to be re-applied from time to time, so just add more as necessary when you notice algae or green water.

, Calcium sulfate, also known as gypsum, is useful for breaking up pond sludge that accumulates at the bottom of the pond. Sprinkle the calcium sulfate evenly across the surface of the pond at a concentration of 525 pounds per acre-foot of water.Calcium sulfate is readily available at most gardening centers.

, The light kills suspended algae (but not string algae) in the water and allows you to easily remove any algae detritus.


UV clarifiers can be attached to either mechanical or biological filters.
UV light is harmful to human eyes, so the UV bulb will be situated within a case. Do not disassemble or remove the case from the UV clarifier.
A clarifier with 8-10 watts of UV light is appropriate for 1,000 gallons of water."

Decide when a deep cleaning is necessary.,
Pump water out of the pond.,
Remove your fish.After you’ve removed most of the water from the pond, transfer your fish to the holding container(s).,
Finish emptying the pond.,
Refill the pond.",How to Care for Your Pond3," If there are many dead leaves and a lot of sludge at the bottom of the pond that you can’t easily remove with a pond vacuum, you’ll need to empty the pond entirely.If you can easily remove debris at the bottom of the pond, a complete cleaning is not necessary.


You should empty and deeply clean your pond at least once a year. The best times to do this are in the spring (so you can remove debris that accumulated during winter) and in the fall (when you’re getting ready to winterize your pond)., You can buy or rent a water pump from most home improvement stores. Ensure the pump has a long extended hose or handle so the pump will reach to an appropriate depth in your pond. To avoid wasting the water, direct it to a garden at the back of your house or to the lawn.


Place some of the pond water in a large tub, inflatable swimming pool, or other large container if you have fish. This water will serve as your holding tank for your fish while the pond is empty., The water level should be high enough that the fish can still swim around, but low enough that you can walk easily in it. Water of about a half-meter in depth is a good level at which to remove the fish.


Remove your fish with a fish net. Scoop the fish out and place them in the container holding pond water you filled earlier.
You might need to place netting or mesh over the container holding the fish to ensure they don’t leap out.

, Once the pond is empty, begin removing the aquatic plants from the pond. If any of the plants need water to survive, put them in a holding tank. Scoop up and remove any dead plants or plant material.


Clean the pond while it is empty. Wash the grime from the bottom and sides of the pond with a pressurized water spray gun.Don’t use bleach or any toxic chemicals on your pond.

, Fill the pond up with clean water. Add a dechlorinating agent to the water.Dechlorinator is a solution designed to remove chlorine from water that comes out of your hose. This is important because chlorine in the water will kill fish. Replace your plants and fish in the pond.


Dechlorinators are readily available at most pet stores. The amount you need will depend on the size of your pond. Consult manufacturer directions for specific use.
To acclimate your fish to the new water, take one gallon of water out of the holding tank and add about one gallon of the new pond water to it every five minutes. After about 30 minutes, transfer the fish back into the pond.

Regularly clean all the debris which gets settled down at the bottom of the pond.

,
Use plenty of aquatic plants.,
Consider using UV clarifiers to help in pond green water treatment.,
Consider water dyes to help as they block direct UV rays coming from sun.

",How to Control Green Pond Water Problems," Your fish can affect the pond water quality. First of all the number fish should be according to the pond size because the organic waste will be more with more fish.;
, when these small algae cells come in contact with sunlight produce algae by photosynthesis.

, These are biological bacteria which are already present in the pond work by decomposing the organic waste quickly, so they help to reduce the nutrients for the algae.

, These are food sources for algae.

,, Aquatic plants in the pond have a huge impact on growing green algae cells as algae require sunlight for its survival so, when aquatic plants restrict the amount of sunlight, green algae causing cells are prohibited.

, It does not harm the pond and aquatic life in any way.

Put the koi back in the pond.",How to Clean a Koi Pond," Make sure you have access to a garden hose that runs properly with fresh, lukewarm water. You should put the spray attachment on the hose so it is easy to use when you rinse and wash out the koi pond., Skimmer nets can be found at your local pet store or online. Look for a skimmer net that has a square end, as it will make it easier to push the net off the sides of the pond to pick up any debris. You can also use the skimmer net on a regular basis to maintain your koi pond and make sure the water stays clean., If you decide to remove your koi from the pond before you clean it, you will need a container that is large enough for the koi to hang out in while you do the pond cleaning. The container should be wide enough for your fish and deep enough for at least one foot of pond water., Dechlorinator will be used to remove the chlorine from the replacement tap water in the pond once it is clean. It is important that you dechlorinate the water before you put the koi back in the pond so the water is healthy for them., The vacuum will make it easier to remove leaves and sludge from the bottom of the pond. Pond vacuums can be found at your local pet store or online. If you do not have access to a pond vacuum, you can also use a shop vacuum, though it may not work as well.Keep in mind a complete clean of the pond could interfere with algae growth in the pond. But if your koi pond is really dirty from the winter or from poor maintenance, you may want to use a vacuum for a more thorough clean.

, The best time to clean your koi pond is at the beginning of spring, when the pond has started to thaw from the winter. Try to plan for an annual pond clean at the beginning of spring when the weather starts to warm up, your koi become more active, and the water is not yet full of bacteria and algae.You can do a fall cleaning if you are not able to clean the pond during the spring. In the fall, your pond may become full of fallen leaves and debris as the trees change, so you may think about doing a clean. However, you should try to maintain the koi pond during the spring, summer, and fall so the once a year clean is easier to do., Get the pond ready for draining and washing by using the skimmer net to remove any debris on the pond’s surface. Try to scoop out all the leaves, branches, and twigs floating on the surface. This will make draining and cleaning the pond easier., You can use the pond pump to drain the water. Make sure you send the water into an area of your yard that has good drainage. Pumping out the water will make it easier to clean the sludge and debris at the bottom of the tank.As you pump out the water, make sure you leave about one foot of water at the bottom of the pond so your fish can swim around. You can then leave your koi in the pond as you wash the pond and clean out any debris. You may decide to leave the koi in the pond if your pond is large and you do not want to deal with taking out all the koi.
If you decide to remove your koi from the pond, you should pump out about one foot of water into the holding container meant for your fish. This way, you can transfer the fish into the container in water that they are used to swimming in to avoid shocking them.

, If you have a small koi pond and you want to give it a complete clean, you can remove your koi from the pond. This is a messy task, so you should wear old clothing and be prepared to get your hands dirty.Use the skimmer net to scoop the koi out and place them gently in the holding container of pond water. Once you have all the koi in the container, you should cover the container with netting or a breathable lid so the koi do not jump out.Place the container in a shaded area in your yard, away from sunlight. This will ensure the koi stay healthy and happy while you clean the pond.

, You should give the pond pump a rinse with the pond water and run the filter through the pond water until it is clean if the pump is not self cleaning. Do not use tap water to clean the filter, as this can destroy the good bacteria in the filter.You should also take out all water accessories in the pond, like water plants or water features. You can then place the plants in a shaded area of your yard and cover them with newspaper to protect them. You should place underwater plants in a container of clean water.
If you have any water features in your pond that are made of non-natural materials, such as plastic items, you can use a toothbrush to scrub and clean them so they are ready to go back into the pond once it is clean., Once you have emptied out the pond, you can take a one hour break and let the sun dry out any newly exposed algae in the pond. This will make it easier for you to get rid of debris and algae once you actually wash out the pond., Take out the water hose with the spray nozzle and blast away at the debris and sludge at the bottom of the pond. Make sure you keep the velvet type of algae lining the pond intact, as this is beneficial algae and should not be disturbed.Use the hose to wash any other attached features on the pond, such as a waterfall or rocks around the perimeter of the pond. Never use any chemicals to clean the pond, only water, as chemicals can introduce toxic substances into the pond environment.
You can then use the pond vacuum to remove any sludge at the bottom of the pond that is hard to get out with the hose. You may come across very smelly goo, decomposed plants, or even a dead frog or fish. Remove it all so the pond is free of any bad bacteria or debris.

, Once you have washed out the pond so it is free of debris and sludge, you should put the pond pump and the pond accessories back in the pond.If you have water plants, you may wait until you fill the pond with new water to place them back in the pond.

, Use the garden hose to refill the pond. Usually, koi ponds are not very deep, around two to three feet deep.Once the pond is filled with new water, add the dechlorinator to the water to remove the chlorine in the water. Turn on the pond pump and allow the water to circulate in the pond for five to ten minutes.To avoid shocking your fish, you should dump some of the water from the holding container and replace it with the new pond water. Do this several times to allow your koi to get used to the new water. The fresh water will be colder than the water your fish are used to and exposing them to water can shock them., Once your koi have been given enough time to get used to the new pond water in the holding container, use the skimmer net to gently place the koi back in the clean pond.If you did not remove your koi from the pond, you can skip this step.

Gently and slowly pull the tick upward.,
Place the tick into your prepared jar.,
Apply a warm compress, if necessary.,
Clean the bite wound.,
Remove the gloves and wash your hands.,
Sterilize your tweezers.,
Watch the bite wound for signs of infection.",How to Remove Ticks from Furry Pets," The rubbing alcohol will kill the tick and the jar can be used to preserve it until you are certain that your pet will not get sick from the bite. Throwing the tick in the garbage or flushing it down a toilet will not be enough to kill it.;
, The bacteria that many ticks carry can enter your bloodstream if it bites your skin or if you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth after handling it bare-handedly, and this bacteria can make you very ill. Disposable gloves are best, since you can throw the gloves away if they get contaminated. You may even wish to wear a double layer of gloves as an added precaution.

, This is especially important if you have a pet that resists being held or fussed over, but even well-behaved pets may try to run away in the middle of treatment. Ask help from someone who can gently hold your pet still without hurting or alarming it.

, If your pet has short hair, you may not have any trouble seeing the tick. If your pet has medium to long fur, however, you or your helper may need to part the fur around the tick to expose it so that you can clearly identify the head. If possible, continue to hold the part with one hand as you remove the tick with the other.

, Ideally, you should aim for the area where the tick enters the skin. Do not grab the body. Use just enough pressure to hold the tick with the tweezers, but do not squeeze it, since squeezing the tick may prompt it to release harmful bacteria into your pet's bloodstream.

, Do not twist the tick, since twisting it increases your chances of decapitating it and causing further problems. Pull with an upward, outward motion instead of going at it from an angle. Do this part slowly, since jerking it away too quickly may cause it to release harmful fluids into your pet's blood.

, Make sure that the tick falls into the rubbing alcohol and does not hang onto the side of the jar. Once it is secure, cap the jar and set it aside in a safe location where it will not be knocked over.

, A tick's mouth parts can occasionally be left behind in your pet's skin. If this happens, apply a warm compress to the area in an effort to expel the parts naturally. Do not attempt to dig them out with your tweezers.


If you cannot remove the mouth-parts with a warm compress, call your veterinarian.

, Sterilize it with rubbing alcohol and apply an antibiotic ointment. Make sure that the ointment you use is safe for pets.


You may need to take extra measures to prevent the animal from licking away the antibiotic or messing with the bite wound. A t-shirt or booties might be enough to prevent your pet from licking its underbelly or paws, respectively, but if not, you may need to use a pet cone.







, Throw the gloves away and do not reuse them, even if they did not come into direct contact with the tick. Similarly, you should wash your hands with antibacterial soap, even though they did not directly touch the tick.

, Dip them into rubbing alcohol, or scrub them clean with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball. You can also sterilize them by passing the tweezers over a flame.

, The area might be a little red after removal. If so, apply a pet-safe hydrocortisone spray to the location to soothe away some of the irritation. If the redness or swelling gets worse within a few hours, however, you should take your pet to the vet. You should also take your pet to the vet if the inflammation does not go away within the first day or two, or if the wound still appears red after a week passes. You should also bring your jarred tick to the vet so that he or she can analyze it and determine what bacteria your pet might be infected with.

Introduce the fish to your aquarium.",How to Set Up a Freshwater Aquarium," A little forethought can go a long way towards keeping your fish healthy and your aquarium fun to maintain. Do a little research on what kind of fish you want, (described in further detail later in this article) and then select a tank that will accommodate them. The tank you choose needs to be large enough to hold enough water for the type and number of fish you plan to have. Different fish need different amounts of room, and produce different amounts of waste. In general, the larger the fish are, the more waste they make and the more water is needed. Keep in mind that live plants and other decorations will also take up space.


There exist various calculators to help you decide what fish are safe to keep based on tank size, compatibility, and needs.The one-inch per gallon rule you may have heard is a rule of thumb that scales quite poorly to smaller or larger tanks. You would never keep two five-inch fish in a 10 gallon (37.9 L) aquarium!
A 55 gallon (208.2 L) tank is a standard size that will allow you to have a variety of fish. As a beginner, you probably don't want to go larger than this just yet.You could also go with a 20 or 25 gallon (75.7 or 94.6 L) tank for a starter tank and keep just a few hardy fish (Mollies, guppies, platys, tetra, small cory cats and no cichlids) to see if you like the hobby.
It is not recommended to start out with anything less than 10 gallons (37.9 L) - meaning no ""Desktop"" aquariums or the small, single Betta holders. As tempting as it is, it is actually harder to maintain good water quality in a small tank.;
, Aquariums that hold 20 gallons (75.7 L) or more will need a stand no matter what unless they are on a heavy, well-anchored counter Buy one that is designed for the dimensions and shape of your tank. Don't underestimate the weight of a full fish tank! Make sure the stand is either rated for the size of your tank or that it has been custom built to be very sturdy. It is vital to the integrity of the tank it will hold that it be sturdy enough to hold the tank's weight. In addition, it is not safe to have an edge of the tank sticking out over the side.


Furniture like dressers, TV stands, end tables/buffets, or flimsy wooden desks aren't strong enough.
Look for complete tank kits at those big box pet stores. Used setups from websites like Craigslist are often available for great prices, but be sure to check for leaks and clean very well before use.
If you don't buy a complete setup, make sure the equipment you choose is rated for the size of your tank.

, Choosing the right spot is important for the health of your fish. You'll want to put it in a place where the temperature remains pretty consistent and the amount of light doesn't get overpowering. Allow at least 5 inches (12.7 cm) between the wall and the aquarium to make room for the filter. Some things to keep in mind when choosing location for your tank:


Too much sunlight will cause excessive algae growth and a maintenance nightmare. An interior wall, away from bright light, is best.
Try to stay away from putting the tank under a vent - dust will blow out and drop into the fish tank. It will also be harder to maintain a consistent water temperature, something that is important for all fish but vital for some.
It is also important to consider the ability of the floor to support the weight of the fully loaded aquarium. Make sure that there is adequate structural support under the floor. If necessary find your home's blueprints and look for crossbeams.
Choose a location near an outlet, and keep in mind how far you will have to haul water for weekly tank maintenance! No cords should be straining to get to the outlet either. In fact, it's a good idea all around to get a surge protector power strip (which you'll love when the power snaps back on after an outage) and go from there.
Set up your tank stand ideally on wooden floor, not a rug or carpet.

, The most common and easiest are either undergravel filters or power filters (recommended for first time owners over undergravel filters) that hang on the back of the tank. Don't get caught up in technology. Penguin and Whisper power filters provide both mechanical and biological filtration and are easy to clean and use. Only use Top Fin if you know your way around filters (get a Whisper if you get the excellent Top Fin starter kit).


If you choose an undergravel filter, make sure that the air pump or powerhead you buy with it is strong enough for the size of the tank. In this case, bigger is better. Note that if you don't regularly vacuum the gravel it will eventually clog the undergravel filter and turn it into a killing zone. Keep in mind that you can't use an undergravel filter if you plan on having sand or other fine substrates.
If you decide to go with a power filter, select one that will circulate enough water for the size of your tank. (Ideally, it should filter your water 5 or more times per hour , depending on your tank capacity. For example: a 10 gal. tank would need a filter that circulates at least 50 gph.)

, The installation methods vary by filter. Figure out which one works with the equipment you have:


For undergravel filters, put the filter plate in, and make sure the lift tubes are fitted. (If you have a submersible powerhead, you only need one; with a traditional air pump, two are best for most tanks under 40 gals, one at each end.) Do not turn it on until the tank is filled completely with water. Attach your pump airlines or powerhead into the appropriate lift tube(s) now, if you've got an undergravel filter. Don't turn it on.
If you've chosen an external power filter, set it up on the back of the tank in a position where the outflow will evenly distribute the water. Some tank hoods come with pre-perforated cut-outs which make it easier to position your equipment. Do not turn it on until the tank is filled completely with water.

, Having about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of gravel on the bottom is essential to a healthy aquarium and helps fish keep their orientation in the water. Cheap gravel (lots of color choices) can be purchased from pet stores dealing in aquarium products.


Sand is optimal for fish and invertebrates that like to burrow but it needs to be stirred on a regular basis to prevent dead spots that can wreak havoc on your tank or ruin a filter. Beginners are better off using gravel.
If you are interested in a planted tank, make sure to get an appropriate substrate. Good ones include Amazonia and Azoo substrates.
Rinse the substrate in clean water before adding it to the aquarium.The less dust in the water, the faster it'll clear when the filter is started up. This step is especially crucial if you're using sand instead of gravel but remains important for all set ups.
Wash gravel through and through. Make sure to use no soap - it is very harmful to fish and will kill them.
Slope the substrate slightly upward toward the back of the aquarium.
If you have an undergravel filter, spread the rinsed gravel in an even layer across the surface of the filter. (Pour in a bit at a time - to allow it to settle the way you want but also because it will scratch the tank walls if you pour it in too fast).
Put a plate on top of the substrate so it doesn't disperse when you add water.

, Make sure you arrange them how you like at this point because once the water and fish are in the tank, you'll want to have as little stress as possible––and that means no hands in the tank.


Plants are functional decorations; it is difficult to make a mechanical filter control a plankton bloom, but live plants make it easy. For some fish, plants actually help them stay healthy. However, live plants get gobbled up quickly by some types of hobby fish such as goldfish. Aside from plants, you can add driftwood or other decorations specifically designed for freshwater aquariums. Don't put random objects in the tank.
Choose the plants you need according to what type of fish you're getting. Submerge the roots in the gravel, but not the stems or leaves.
Certain plants need to be fastened to something, so get some fishing line (will not hurt the plant or fish) and tie the plant to a decoration or an appropriately cleaned piece of driftwood or rock.

, Fill the tank with about two inches of water, then wait for a half an hour. If there are any leaks, it's better they show up now, rather than when you have filled the entire thing. If you don't see leaks, fill up the tank about 1/3 full.


Do this somewhere where you won't mind water if it does leak. Have sealant on hand so that you can dry the tank and start fixing it.

, Once you are sure that all the decorations are just the way you want, fill the tank up to just under the rim of the tank, leaving a gap of 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Fill the reservoir of the filter with water, and plug it in! Water should smoothly (and quietly) circulate after a couple of minutes. Plug in the powerhead/pump if you have an undergravel filter. Water should start moving vertically in the lift tube(s).


Wait for an hour or two, and check that the temperature is still in the safe range, that there are no leaks, and that the water is circulating properly.

, It will attach with suction cups. Try to position it near or at the mouth of the filter expelling water. This way the water will be evenly heated. Most of the thermostats on new heaters now come pre-set at an acceptable temperature range of 70-77 degrees Fahrenheit (21-25 degrees Celsius). Plug in the heater and install your thermometer. Do not turn it on until the tank is filled completely with water.


The fully-submersible heaters are the easiest to use. Look for one with an adjustable thermostat, since different fish prefer different temperatures. A good rule of thumb is 3-5 watts of heat per gallon of water. Most fish like it between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Basically, keep it between 78-82 degrees F. or 28-32 degrees C in a community tank.
Some lights (sometimes included in starter kits) put out so much heat that the water temperature will be drastically altered. When it is turned off, the temp. falls drastically as well. Not good for fish. If this happens, simply go to the hardware store and get the kind that don't give off such extreme heat.
Remember to turn on the heater only after water is added to the tank.
Give the heater time to adjust the temperature before cycling the tank.

, Tap water contains chlorine and other chemicals that will kill fish, so it's necessary to add a neutralizer unless you use distilled water off the bat. Add the dechlorinator according to the instructions on the bottle. This is also the time to add a starting dose of SafeStart or other bacterial catalyst which will speed up the growth of good bacteria.


Make sure to follow the instructions on the bottle closely. The activated carbon of your filter may need to be removed while the chemical circulates, otherwise the filter may remove it before it has a chance to detoxify the water.

, For instructions on the fishless cycle (the most humane way to grow the beneficial bacteria all tanks need) see Do a Fishless Cycle. The cycle must be completed before you add any fish to the tank, or they will die. During the cycle you need to monitor the water parameters (pH, High pH, Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate). When the numbers for Am., Nitrite, and then Nitrate spike and lower to 0, you have completed your initial Nitrogen Cycle and are in the clear to add fish. (To help move Ammonia and Nitrites along, you may have to use Ammonia Remover. The only way to reduce the Nitrates is to do water changes and physically remove the bad chemicals).


Remember to continue doing water tests, especially with a new tank. You may need to do daily 15% water changes to keep your fish tank clean, depending on the nitrate levels. Adding live plants will reduce the amount of nitrates as well.

, Discuss what type of freshwater, tropical fish you want to have with the sales person.They should give you tips on which types can and can't get along, and so forth. Look for a locally-owned fish store in the area, since they tend to provide the most accurate information and high-quality fish. Quality pet stores usually have compatibility charts for freshwater and saltwater fish.


Although you may see two types of fish you really like, they may not be compatible. The result of bringing them both home would be harassed colorless fish (they lose color when stressed), and eventually the fish that is not the alpha bully will simply die. Why spend the money, right?
Often, fish stores will have stickers that indicate whether the fish are ""community"" fish (highly recommended as they get along with other community fish), ""semi-aggressive"" or ""aggressive"". You may mix community fish together, but not community with semi-aggressive.
If this is your first tank, do not get fish that are only recommended for intermediate or experienced aquarium owners. Like owning a dog, there is a reason they are not for beginners.
Be aware of the size of the adult fish (not the baby you're getting) and do not get a fish you won't be able to handle down the line. The same goes for freshwater sharks, crabs (who, by the way, try to escape all the time), Cichlids, and animals that bury themselves. It's not fair to the fish.
Guppies, platies, swordtails, or mollies are good starter fish. But it all depends on your tank size. If your tank size is 5–10 gallons (18.9–37.9 L), you might get 3-4 African dwarf frogs, or a betta, or possibly a betta and some shrimp. Do lots of research before adding any fish to your tank.Do not only use the 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fish per gallon rule.

, Know all the fish you hope to eventually have in your fish tank and buy two of the smallest (this goes for all types except for schooling fish, which should be bought in groups of 4 (ideally 6+). You can introduce a new group of fish every 2 weeks. Add the largest fish last.

, The salesperson will have filled a plastic clear bag with water, then fish, then blow it up with oxygen. When you get to the car, rest the bag in a place where it won't roll around or have something fall on it. Go straight home. The fish can only survive on the water and oxygen they've been given for maybe 2 1/2 hours. For trips longer than that, different packing procedures should be taken.

, Let it sit there for about 20 or 30 minutes. Then open the bag and let some of the water from the tank in. Be sure to not let any water from the bag into the tank! Let it sit for another 20 or 30 minutes. Gently net the fish out and pour all the pet store's water in the sink. Or pour the fish into the net over a bucket and then release into tank. Discard store water.

The reason you do not want to add pet store water into your tank is because the store water may contain unwanted contaminants like parasites, fungus, or freshwater snails. Pet stores that cycle their fish rapidly often treat their water regularly for diseases, but in a home tank you will not have the same tools available and an infection or infestation can wreak havoc on your tank's ecosystem.

, Start with two or three fish the first ten days, then get two or three more, wait another ten days, etc. If you put too many fish at once into a new tank, the water will not be able to adequately cycle, and will quickly turn toxic. Patience is the key for the first six to eight weeks. That said, a big mistake people make is to buy schooling fish but only get 1 or 2 of them. This is stressful and cruel for the fish. A school means that a group of 5 is the minimum. A great book for stocking suggestions is ""The simple guide to freshwater aquariums by David E Boruchowitz"".

Plecos can be up to 15-24 inches long when they’re fully grown.Your tank should ratio should be 1 gallon of water for one inch of fish.
Pleco catfish live for 20-30 years, so it will take them awhile to reach their full grown size. You can always get a new tank when your pleco reaches its full size.
For many plecos, a 100 gallon tank is the best size tank. This will make sure your pleco has room to grow. Additionally, this size will allow you to add more plecos later.;
, You’ll want to make sure that you have a stand to support your large tank. This will make sure your tank is secured and won’t fall over.Iron and wood stands are the most common type of stands for aquariums. Wood stands are more expensive, but sturdier.
Pur your aquarium stand in a low traffic area to avoid it being knocked over. Keep it out of direct sunlight as well as away from heating or cooling ventilation.

, Use a clean wet cloth to clean the tank before rinsing it. You’ll want to make sure no visible dirt remains on the tank.When cleaning the tank, use a slow, light circular motion. You can damage the tank by cracking or breaking it by using too much pressure when cleaning it.
After cleaning the tank, let the tank dry for a few days. This will make sure nothing grows, including harmful bacteria.

Decide what kind of aquarium you want.,
Be prepared to set aside a reasonable amount of money to set up your aquarium.,
Depending on what kind of aquarium fish content you choose, you need to determine how big the tank will be.,
After you have decided what kind of tank you want, decide which (and how many) fish you want.,
Go to local pet stores or look online for fish that appeal to you and to ascertain their suitability.,
Decide if you want to plant your tank or not (if it's a freshwater aquarium).,
Plan the static contents of the tank.,
Locate the aquarium in a suitable place.,
Keep safety considerations at the forefront.,
Set aside a month or more for your tank to cycle before you get your fish.,
Find your fish.",How to Plan an Aquarium," Before you even get started on purchasing the aquarium and its supplies, you need to be certain of the type of fish and fish community that you'd like to keep. Some fish will require more work to maintain than others, so this might be one of your first considerations. There are various types of fish tank styles and communities that you can choose from, including a goldfish tank, a cichlid tank, a saltwater tank, aggressive fish, a mixed community, etc. The best choice for a beginner is a goldfish tank or a freshwater tropical community tank as these are the simplest to maintain. Or, you might like to consider a betta (Siamese fighting fish) bowl or tank but, as largely a ""fish"" tank rather than a ""fishes"" tank, it's rather limiting.


""Community"" fish are fish that get along with many other kinds of fish and do not require unusual water conditions. They do not need to be with fish of other species. Most don't need to be with other fish of their own, though some such as tetras, are happiest in schools. But it seems nice to keep at least two fish together so they can't get too bored and it also provides more interest for you.

Goldfish are tough, but they do best in cool water. Don't use a heater, and keep them away from a window. They have a fast metabolism and don't digest their food very efficiently, so they produce a lot of waste. A moderately-stocked tank with a good filter is much better than a bowl - and a requirement for a healthy,long life for the fish. The unusual-looking ""fancy"" varieties do not compete well with the normal-shaped common varieties, so choose one category or the other.
Bettas naturally live in swamps in which they can't see very far (and the males, the colorful ones normally sold, defend modest territories by attacking much of what they can see); they can't move very much (and so don't move, eat or excrete much), and often don't have enough oxygen (and so are fortunate to have a special ""labyrinth organ"" to process gulped air).They do best with clean water and swimming space, so a 2 1/2 gallon (9.46 liter) to 5 gallon tank with a filter is a good way to learn the basics of caring for fish. You can't keep more than one male in a tank (at least not without little in-tank compartments). Female bettas can be kept in groups of 4-6, but make sure one is not very aggressive. They tend to abuse other fish, due to aggression, or be abused, due to ornamental bettas' long, ineffective fins, but can get along with some community fish such as small catfish.;
, The greatest cost is when you buy the start-up gear, but there are the ongoing costs of fish food, replacement fish, dechlorinator, etc. Be prepared to spend US$50-$100 for a small tank and equipment (5-10 gallons (19 to 37 liters), freshwater). Saltwater tanks start at hundreds of dollars. However, you might be able to pick up a bargain during sales if you know what you're looking for.


If buying or receiving a used tank, check it thoroughly for cracks, hairlines, and any faulty parts. Fill it all the way up in a bathtub or outside to check for leaks. You are best off buying all the electrical equipment brand new even if you get the tank secondhand.

, If you chose a saltwater tank, you will need at least a 30 gallon (114 liters) aquarium, while the optimal would be a 50 gallon (190 liter) or more tank.The minimum size to try for a freshwater community aquarium would be 20 gallons (75.7 liters). If you decide on a betta, you will need at least a 5 gallon tank (19 liters). Small fancy goldfish should have no less than 20 gallons (75.7 liters) per fish. Large goldfish like comets will need at least a 100 gallon (378.5 liter) tank when full grown. Remember, bigger is always always better when it comes to aquariums.


Bear in mind that the surface area is more important than the shape of the aquarium because the surface area is where the gas exchange occurs., Say you chose a 10 gallon (37 liter) freshwater community aquarium. As a rule of thumb, provide at least one gallon (3.7 liters) of space per inch (2.5cm) of fish. So, in a 10 gallon (37 liter) tank, you could have ten one-inch fishes. For instance, three two-inch (5cm) platies and 4 one-inch neon tetras.


The amount of fish flesh, and its metabolism and waste production, increases very roughly with volume, the cube of length. So the inch-per-gallon rule is best with typical little two to four-inch fish. You could add two or three one-inch neon tetras per gallon, but a ten-inch (25.4cm) cichlid might need twenty gallons (75.7 liters) of water to himself and a powerful filter.
Make sure your fish can swim several times their body length before turning around. Two five-inch (14cm) fish would be uncomfortable in a little ten gallon tank, but ten of them could swim around merrily in a fifty gallon tank.
Sea or marine sourced fishes must be stocked at rate considerably lower than that of their freshwater cousins., Then do research on those fish and see if they will be compatible in your tank. Not all fish can be kept in the same tank, even if they are all freshwater community fish (there are different degrees of ""community"" tolerance), all saltwater fish, or all cichlids (cichlid home environments differ, and each aggressive species' type of aggression differs and should be researched carefully). A tiger barb and a guppy will probably not live together peacefully: tiger barbs will nip long fins.

, Plants can improve water quality and ambiance for fish if healthy, but require more maintenance and equipment such as upgraded lights like those for saltwater reefs (which can create an overheating problem) and some require carbon dioxide injection (good filtration tends to aerate out all the fish themselves produce).If you decide to plant your tank, be careful to choose only plants that will not get too big for your tank. Keep in mind plants are not appropriate for goldfish tanks.


If you want to have plants, choose algae eaters that won't eat the plants. Siamese algae eaters (""True algae"") are effective and compatible with many other fish.
Plastic plants create much of the human-pleasing appearance and most if not all of the fish-pleasing hiding spaces of real plants. You can take them out and wash them to remove excess algae. Soap and other cleaners are very bad for fish, so don't use any or rinse very thoroughly. However, some fish will be much happier with live plants.
Saltwater tanks more commonly have corals, most of which photosynthesize, and macroalgae than true plants. Saltwater fish aren't easy to care for, and corals are harder.

, Fish need cover. Will you provide it with caves or plants? Fake plants? Real plants? A pirate ship? It is a good idea to sketch your aquarium and lay out where decorations and plants will go. Try to include varied hiding spots and give consideration to the introduction of plants that would best mimic the plants the fish you're getting are used to.


Be aware that the decorations and plants suitable for a freshwater tank and for a saltwater tank are extremely different. For starters, you can't grow plants in a saltwater tank because freshwater plants won't grow in saltwater and the plants that will grow in saltwater (macroalgae) provide tasty treats for the fish and disappear in no time!And decorations suitable for a freshwater tank may not be suited to a saltwater tank; for saltwater, prefer plastic plants, ceramic or plastic ornaments. Do not use driftwood as it will leach tannin into a saltwater tank and acidify the water.What sort of gravel, sand, or other substrate will you have for the base of the tank? Even rocks, coral, and substrate must be chosen with care to avoid harming the saltwater balance, so always take these matters into account when selecting the design elements.

, There are several considerations here, including safety, temperature, and accessibility.


Ensure that the tank sits on a level, solid, and structurally sound surface. Put the tank in a place that isn't likely to get bumped but if it does, it will not topple over. If you live in an earthquake prone region, ask about how you can bolt the tank to the wall or another surface to ensure that it doesn't end up on the ground.
Also, check how much weight the floor can take; water can cause a lot of damage. A big tank needs not only to be kept from falling on the floor but supported evenly. With gravel and accessories, a tank weighs about ten pounds (4.5kg) per gallon (3.75 liters). For example, a 55 gallon tank (209 liters) weighs around 600 pounds (274kg) when full of water and the ground needs to be able to cope with the weight.A stand with solid sides rather than just legs is a good idea to help distribute the weight over the entire stand and not just down the four legs.Five gallons (19 liters) can be OK on a sturdy table; ten gallons (37 liters) should, and twenty (75.7 liters) or more essentially must have a purpose-built stand.
Ensure that the tank is not located near direct sunlight, drafts, doorways, and windows. You need to guard against temperature extremes and these are the locations likely to cause such variations. Be careful not to locate a tank under a heating or cooling vent either.Keep in mind where you will make water changes when locating the tank; close proximity of a water supply and basin is important.

, As well as ensuring that the tank is located in a safe and solid position, consider the importance of grounding the tank. Water conducts electricity, and saltwater conducts it very well. Install a ground-fault circuit interrupter outlet (GFCI/GFI) or plug all the equipment into a portable one, which looks like an extension cord with a bulky plug with buttons. Make a ""drip loop"" with each cord: it should dangle down and come up again before connecting to any socket so water running down it won't get in. Do not plug the aquarium into any outlet that isn't protected by a GFI or into a circuit that isn't protected by a GFI circuit breaker., While you're probably anxious to get your fish to move in, patience is key in this hobby. If you are not going to take the time to set up your tank properly, don't bother. If you put many fish in an ""uncycled"" tank–one not allowed to develop beneficial bacteria by feeding those depositing themselves from the environment or a bacterial supplement with the waste of a fish or two for a few weeks–you will cause numerous problems with diseases, rising ammonia and nitrate levels, and end up with lots of dead fish. Cycling the tank is about building up the nitrogen content and there is varied advice on how to go about doing this, depending on the tank type. If you ask at the pet store, they may be able to recommend a bacterial culture that you can use (follow the package instructions). Fish author Boruchowitz suggests that caution is your best ally in cycling the tank and for a marine tank, to begin with one to two fish fed sparingly over a few weeks, test the water and if it's within acceptable ammonia limits, to introduce one or two more and do the same for a few weeks more.Then, when it has all regulated after about six weeks, add the entire content of the tank. Another possibility is to use a bio-filter, transferring gravel, a bio-filter wheel, or from an established tank into the new tank.However, it is a good idea to read the suggestions specific to your fish species to find the best way to cycle the tank in your situation.


Use this time to learn about tank care and specific requirements. Saltwater tanks, for example, require quite a lot of additional maintenance and equipment, so it's important tor read up on what you should do and to make sure that you have all of the equipment in place, such as a hydrometer, thermometer, how to mix the salt solution, how to vacuum substrate, filtration, lighting, etc. If this list is already wearing you out, it's not a good idea to start with saltwater tanks as a beginner!

, When you have set up your tank, cycled it, and settled on what fish you want, you can head to the local fish store and pick out your new aquatic buddies. After that, you might like to read an article on wikiHow for caring for your fish, such as:

Be cautious about including plant life with your pleco.,
Purchase or make dechlorinated water.,
Buy rocks for your pleco’s tank.,
Fill the tank with dechlorinated water.,
Install your filter into the tank.,
Install lighting, heating, and a thermometer.,
Allow your tank to cycle.",How to Set Up a Fish Tank for Plecostomus Catfish2," Plecos are herbivores and are known to tear up plant life in their tank. It may also be a problem when including artificial plants.


Plecos may tear apart any planted plant life in their tank. This can create quite a mess and injure the pleco.Some species of plecos will do fine in a planted tank. Talk to the pet store and do research before choosing a planted tank for your pleco.

, Most tap water has chlorine in it, which can be harmful to your pleco. You can also make your own using a dechlorinator or purchase it at a pet store.Chlorine can cause chemical burns, stress, or excess ammonia for your fish and their tank. You can leave out tap water to get rid of chlorine in your water, but it will not get dissolve chloramine from your tap water.Purchasing a dechlorinator is the best option for making your water safe for your fish. You can add this chemical to tap water in order to get rid of chlorine, chloramine and other potentially harmful chemicals.

, Plecos do not need substrate, but they do prefer it. Once you find these rocks, place the rocks in the bottom of the tank.


Plecos are also fine if there is no substrate in the tank. However, it helps them move around the tank, since they use their sucker to find food throughout the tank.
Gravel can work well for plecos. Leave the same batch of gravel once it’s added, since it retains beneficial bacteria for your pleco.
Use about 1.5-2 pounds of gravel for every gallon of water. The gravel should be cleaned and rinsed before being added to the tank.

, The tank should be filled to about 2 inches from the top. After filling up the tank, you can put decorations in the tank.Don’t pour water on top of the gravel in the tank. It can disrupt the gravel. Use a clean dish to pour your tank water into to keep the gravel settled.
Room temperature water is the best to use. Cold water can cause condensation and make you think the tank is leaking.

, You’ll want to have a filter suitable for the tank size you have. Test it out to make sure it works once it’s installed with the water and gravel.


All aquariums need a filtration system. Your filter should be able to do mechanical (solid debris), chemical (pollutants), and biological filtration (bacteria).Observe your filter for a few days. Since there are no fish in the tank at this point, observe how well the filtration system works.

, Your pleco tank needs to be well lit and heated. It’s important to check the water’s temperature so your pleco is comfortable and safe.Lighting can bring our your pleco's colors and help plant growth. Limit your lighting to only 7-10 hours per day to avoid bacteria growth in your tank.
Heaters set the tank temperature at between 75-80 degrees for tropical fish. Your pleco is adaptable and can handle temperatures as low as the 60s.
Use a thermometer to make sure your heater is working and your water temperature has not changed. Plecos can be injured by water that is too cold or too warm.

, Cycling is when you set up a bacteria bed for your filter to work with the fish's natural bacteria, along with ammonia and nitrate. This will help to prevent new tank syndrome.You can cycle your tank with fish or without. If you use fish, get some durable fish that your local pet store can recommend.
You can cycle the tank without fish as well. You’ll just need to use ammonia and water to get the right chemical makeup for your new tank.
Check the ammonia and nitrate level regularly. You'll want it to be just right for your new pleco.

Ensure the plecostomus fish are not diseased.,
Buy your pleco and bring them to your tank.,
Follow the two female to one male ratio.",How to Set Up a Fish Tank for Plecostomus Catfish3," Verify their health before you bring them to their new home. Plecos can have a number of diseases, including ich, dropsy, fin rot, and fish fungus.Ich is also called white spot and consists of tiny white spots on the pleco's body. It can be treated using medication available at most pet stores.
Dropsy and fin rot are noticeable due to bloating and discoloration. In fin rot, the discoloration is primarily located around the pleco's fin.
Fish fungus is white or gray growths that look like cotton balls. It is usually an infection affiliated with another preexisting skin condition.

, They will be uncomfortable if put immediately in the water. Bob the fish bag in the tank until the water in the bag is the same temperature as the tank water.


Plecos need to adjust to the temperature of the tank. Allow the water they are in to get up to the tank temperature before releasing them.
Additionally, plecos can be quite aggressive and territorial when introduced to a new tank. Have them alone in their tank at first., Plecos can be aggressive towards other male plecos. It's a good idea to determine the gender of your pleco before purchasing them, especially if you plan to have more than one.Female plecos are generally larger than the males. If a pleco has not been treated well, a smaller size may indicate poor treatment.
Female plecos have a rounder body, while male plecos are generally skinnier. You can usually observe this when looking at the pleco from above the tank.

Enjoy watching your new fish in his brand new home!",How to Acclimate Your Fish to Your Aquarium   Floating Method," Many species of fish cannot coexist with each other within a small tank, and many species can grow to be quite large. Start by asking yourself the following three questions below. Once you have a general idea of the type of fish you want, you may also need to purchase additional hiding spaces or plants to make their adjustment as stress free as possible. Many fish will have a similar reaction to a new habitat, which includes hiding from anything and everything for upwards of a week. As with any animal, it is important to provide them with a place to feel safe and call their own as soon as they are introduced to their new home.


Do I want a fish of function? - Many fish aren't just pretty faces, they actually contribute to the well-being of the tank by cleaning up algae stuck to the walls, gravel or plants. Some even eat the poop of other fish, which sounds disgusting, and it is, but it's healthy for them and helps keep your tank sparkling!

How big will it grow? - While sharks are awesome, they tend to grow to a fairly large size, making them the less than ideal fish for the typical home aquarium enthusiast. Try to find a fish whose maximum size will not be more than 1/5 of the total length of the tank. This will allow them to grow to their maximum size comfortably, and allow them to stretch their fins every now and then.

Are my current fish compatible? - As previously stated, many fish are not suited for living within close proximity to other species of fish.;
, Many aquarium stores have a wide selection of fresh and salt water fish available for purchase; however, some of the more exotic species may require you to travel to a specialty fish outlet or breeder. You may even be required to order one from overseas. In many cases, the aquarium store will be able to place your special order for you, and will inform you when your new fish has arrived at the store., Many stores will present your new fish to you in a small plastic bag containing some water from their old habitat or tank. The old water contains familiar smells and pheromones that calm the fish and provide a friendly environment for transport. The bag is not a cheap alternative to traditional packaging; the fish is presented in a bag because the walls of the bag are thin enough to transfer heat and acclimate to the surrounding temperatures. This will be explained in further detail in the next step., Let it float there. Do not open the bag! The water the fish was living in at the store or previous location is most likely warmer or colder than that of your tank, and simply dumping the new fish into a water with a drastic difference in temperature can cause the fish to go into shock, preventing their gills from filtering the oxygen out of the water, effectively drowning them.

Introducing the warm/cold water within the bag to the warm/cold water of the tank allows it to slowly adjust to the same temperature of the outside water, without introducing them to the new smells and pheromones of the old fish.

, After that, the temperature of the water within the bag should be the same as that of the rest of the aquarium. It is still not safe to simply dump the fish into the tank.

Start by opening the bag and dumping half of the water in the bag into your aquarium. This lets your old fish know there's a new fish in the tank as the pheromones mix with the old water and dissipate. Fill the bag with some of the water from your tank and tie it back up. Now the new fish has a smell for the old fish in your tank. This works as kind of an introduction of fish before coming face to face. When the time comes, they will recognize the smell of one another, and no battles for dominance will ensue, provided you did your research and chose compatible fish in step 1.

, The water will be thoroughly mixed enough to introduce the new fish fully into its new environment. Your new fish will most likely sink to the bottom and remain motionless.

Don't panic! This is the fish's way of remaining undetected in an unfamiliar habitat. It may take some time for your new fish to find a location he's ready to call home, and he may butt heads with a few old tank mates, but eventually he will have a little space within your tank all to himself!

, It can be quite fun watching them meet and interact with the other fish for the first time. Fish can be just as quirky as cats or dogs!"

Exercise is necessary too, and it's a way of burning your calories instead of eating barely any at all. Dieting also takes self control which can be extremely challenging sometimes.;
, BMI is your body mass index, calculating your weight and the amount of fat you have. If yours is higher than average, you may be over weight or have big/strong muscles, because muscle weighs more than fat. If you're lower than average, than means you're usually underweight. However, your BMI isn't always accurate so don't freak out. If your body mass index is normal, you probably don't need to diet. But everybody who's in the normal range wants to get rid of that extra belly fat. That's okay, you just need to know when you're going to lose too much weight if you're dieting continuously.

Carbohydrates ~ There are many misconceptions about carbohydrates. Everybody tries to avoid carbohydrates but, in actuality, they are the main source of energy for your body. Without carbohydrates, you will be on the road to hydration and the breaking down of protein. Also your body cannot function properly and it's necessary for physical activity. Aim for around 100 grams of carbohydrates a day. It varies depending upon your age though. Great sources of carbohydrates are:






100% Whole Grains such as whole wheat bread, whole grain cereals like Kashi (you can also look for a white check mark on any cereal box) and Fiber One.
Medium-grain brown rice (Add some vegetables to your rice!)
Vegetables
Peanuts
Fruits and vegetables (You can eat fruits with cereal and oatmeal)
Oatmeal



Calcium ~ Calcium makes up 99% of your bones, including teeth. It's necessary for the growth, strength, and health of your bones. Great sources of calcium are:






Dairy products such as milk, yogurt and cheese.
Green vegetables like cabbage, broccoli, and black eyed peas.
Sardines
Tofu



Energy, known as calories to most. They maintain your normal bodily functions. Extra calories are often stored as fat, though. This is why if you're trying to lose weight you want to limit your intake of calories. The trick is to burn more calories than you consume, which is where exercise comes in. If you burn less calories during the day than you consume, that's when you start to gain weight. A huge lack of calories can result in your starvation or death. The required amount of calories is different for every person. To find out, you can try using a calorie calculator.







Fiber ~ Fiber is incredibly important in your diet. It can help reduce the possibility of getting cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Great sources of fiber are:






Oatmeal
Nuts (Especially almonds, walnuts and pecans!)
Vegetables
Popcorn (Popcorn is actually one of the healthiest snacks you can have when it is without any butter or other things added to it.)
Whole grains



Iodine ~ Iodine is important, and needed for the function in almost all parts of your body. This is because Iodine makes Thyroid hormones (if you would like, you can look up why those hormones are so important). Iodine helps us to be able to think, maintain our body weight, and also helps to give us energy! Foods that are high iodine are:






Iodized salt - This is the most basic way to gain the correct levels of iodine needed. However, too much salt is never a good thing.
Milk
Seafood
Eggs (Boiled eggs with salt are awesome.)



Iron ~ Iron is also incredibly important to the body, and people with iron deficiency are required to take iron. Iron brings oxygen throughout your body. Without enough iron, you can become anemic and your red blood cells wouldn't be able carry enough oxygen. Foods high in iron are:






Egg yolk
Dark green vegetables
Liver (Especially duck liver! This may seem kind of gross to some.)
Roasted pumpkin seeds



Protein ~ Protein is incredibly important and an excessive lack of protein can result in the break down of body tissues, weaken your heart, and stunt your growth. Protein builds up your muscles and your bones. Great sources of protein are:






Dairy
Eggs
Milk
Seafood
Beans
Walnuts



Potassium ~ Potassium maintains blood pressure and without potassium, your nervous system could not function properly and is important in transmitting your nerve impulses for muscle contractions. Foods high in potassium are:






Bananas
Potatoes
Milk
Haddock
Tomato juice
Soy beans



Sodium ~ Sodium is important in fluid distribution throughout your body, electrical activity and your blood pressure. Too much sodium and too little can have consequential results. Sodium is found in almost everything you eat, and even in water! Some best sources of sodium are:






Table salt
Baking soda and baking powder
Salami
Cheese
Crab (saltwater)



, Because when you're dieting, you have to keep in mind you still need these nutrients in your diet. Use some of these foods and figure out how to incorporate them into your diet. For example, put some iodized salt on a hard boiled egg, have a chicken salad with a glass of milk. For breakfast, you could have some oatmeal with fresh fruit on it, or a milk shake with ice, milk, protein powder, add some blueberries or strawberries. There are tons of ways to combine these nutrients into great tasting foods.

, Water makes up almost 70% of your body! Therefore water serves many functions. It helps your digestion, prevents dizziness and dehydration. Water decreases your appetite, and it's actually not possible to lose weight without drinking a lot of water.

, Dehydration can cause dizziness, fatigue, loss of concentration and with severe dehydration, it's possible to die. This isn't supposed to scare you, it's fact. To tell if you're dehydrated, your pee will be dark yellow. Also, when you stick out your tongue, it will have that pasty white stuff on it if you're dehydrated.

, Instead of sugary cereals, replace it with raisin bran. Instead of using sugar, use Splenda. Instead of eating white bread, eat whole wheat bread. Instead of drinking soda like Sprite (even Diet Sprite isn't too healthy), have a Sprite by Weight Watchers. You can search online and find tons of alternatives to the foods you love.

, Everybody has heard that! Never skip breakfast. It's a common misconception that skipping meals will help, which includes breakfast. In fact, a study has shown that skipping breakfast has negative outcomes, not positive. Kids are not as well focused in school and experience fatigue and lack of concentration. It helps maintain your weight, and helps you lose weight. There are tons of benefits from eating breakfast so make sure you don't skip, and eat something healthy. It keeps you going until lunch time. There's a saying, ""Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a peasant."" Breakfast should be your biggest meal, while all your other meals of the day should be on the small side. These are a couple breakfast possibilities:


Whole grain cereal that's high in fiber with some fruit. A cup of milk (if you like milk), or a cup of yogurt. (The mini packaged ones.)
Grapefruit with Splenda, some cheese (separately, of course), and bring a couple walnuts with you to school. At least one cup of water.
Oatmeal (Instant oatmeal is best if you don't have much time in the morning.) with fresh fruit on it (like blueberries, cut strawberries, and raspberries). You could have small smoothie too. (Like a strawberry smoothie.)
Yogurt with some granola and fruit. (Water, too, of course.)
Apples with peanut butter with a piece of toast.

, However it's usually not the healthiest food in the world (but not necessarily). The best solution is to bring your lunch to school. Prepare it the night before so you're not rushing to pack it in the morning.

, Are you really still hungry? Most people get seconds when they're full, but their body hasn't registered it yet. Have you drank any water? If not, have a cup or two of water and then reconsider getting more food. Many people mistake thirst for hunger. Yes, water fills you up just as much as food. Have you ever noticed, when you drink a lot of water, you're all of a sudden full and food would be the last thing on your mind? Probably. When people eat more food than they should, that's when they gain weight, so be weary of that!

, When you fill your whole plate with food, you're likely to eat all of it, even if you shouldn't. If you use smaller plates, you know you won't be over eating. If you were over eating before, you may seem to feel hungry more. Within a couple days, your body will adjust.

, The percentages beside each nutrient is based on a 2,000 calorie diet. There are many things to look for. Look for:


Serving sizes
Number of servings
Calorie count
Calories from fat
Total amount of fat
Amount of saturated fat
Fiber
Sugars
Protein

, It's almost always measured as grams and percentage of your daily value. It's always based off a 2000 calorie diet so never assume that's the exact amount you need. Different people need to eat different amounts of calories. There's a ""five finger rule"", where if there's 10% or more of positive nutrients like fiber, protein, vitamin C, Calcium, Vitamin A etc., you put one finger up and if there's more than five, it's good to eat. However, every time there's more than 10% of a bad nutrient, you put a finger down. If you still have one or two fingers up, than it's on the healthier side. You put a finger down if it has more than 200 calories per serving (but this varies depending on the food).

, Exercise is one of the most important parts of a diet and losing weight. Exercise burns calories, and calories are what you depend on to get you through the day. Because calories are often stored as fat, you need to burn more calories than you consume, therefore losing the stored fat. You can't just lose weight magically, it takes real effort. Some great ways to lose calories are:


Bike riding.
Start doing a sport like soccer, basketball, swimming, or lacrosse.
Jumping rope.
Walking your pet everyday.
Walk everywhere that's within walking distance.

, Keep in mind that in addition to eating healthily, you're going to be eating less, but not to the extent it's unhealthy; that's what dieting includes (in case you forgot).

, Recently, they changed the food pyramid to the food plate. The food plate shows about how much space on your plate each food group should take up. The five food groups are:


Vegetables
Grains
Fruits
Dairy
Protein foods

, Obviously you won't necessarily be able to eat the perfect amount of the food groups everyday, as not many people can. Especially because you're dieting; but you can fit at least a little of each food group into your day.

, You can overeat anything which is unhealthy. If it's a food that's good for you, eating too much is still a bad thing. For example, if you drink too much water, you will experience water intoxication. It lowers the amount of sodium in your system through osmosis and excessive amounts of water fills the cells and they could almost reach the point where they could burst.

Surround yourself with healthy people.",How to Have a Healthy Diet As a Teenager," Think about it like this, when a car needs gas you stop to fuel up. That way you can continue driving instead of breaking down in the middle of the road. Your body is just the same. Each morning you need to refill your body so it can make it through the day. Consider some simple options for a well rounded breakfast to start your day.Whole grain cereal with fruit. Sugary or chocolate covered cereals seem fun and tasty, but to really fuel your body you need a cereal high in fiber, not sugar. Top it with a banana or strawberries for a natural sweetener.
Peanut butter toast. You can make it in one minute and eat it on the go. The protein in the peanut butter will help keep you full all morning. Just make sure to eat whole wheat or a multigrain bread for added fiber.
Make a smoothie. If you’re not big on eating breakfast, consider drinking it. Blend ¾ cup plain yogurt, 1 cup of fruit, and 1 cup of milk.;
, It’s hard to admit it as a teenager, but your mom was right. Fruits and vegetables are full of vitamins and and minerals that your body needs to grow. School lunches turn you off to broccoli? Not a problem. There is a multitude of fruits and veggies available, with just as many ways to cook them.Mix fruit with yogurt or a smoothie for natural sugars.
Top a sandwich with apple or cucumber slices for an added crunch.
Roast veggies as chip alternatives.

, The right kinds of fat, like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, can help energize your body and absorb vitamins. Too much of the unhealthy, saturated, fat puts you at an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. Try including these foods in your diet to increase your healthy fat intake.Nuts. All nuts are comparable in terms of protein and calories, so eat whatever you like best! Take a handful to snack on, or finely chop some to add to salads. Just be sure to avoid nuts that have been roasted in oil and heavily salted.Eggs. There are many ways to cook eggs, and are good for more than just breakfast! Fry, scramble, or make an omelet to start your day, or hard boil them to eat as a snack or topped on a salad.
Avocados. Spread avocados on toast, add it to a sandwich, or mash it up for guacamole. Avocados can be a creamy substitute for alternative fats in other recipes as well!, Giving your body enough protein is what helps keep your heart and brain healthy, as well as helping your body build muscles. Protein is found in chicken, beef, cheese, fish, nuts, and soy products. Just try to avoid less healthy options, like cheeseburgers and fried chicken, and more lean protein, such as fish and grilled chicken.

, Many teenagers worry about eats carbs because they’ve heard they’re “bad,” when actually carbs are what gives your body the most energy. So while you don’t want to eliminate them from you diet, you do want to make smart choices.Choose bread that is high in fiber, 2-3g per slice.
Eat whole wheat over white bread. Whole wheat bread is less processed than white bread, and contains more of the grain’s natural vitamins and minerals for your body.Substitute quinoa for rice. Both grains make excellent side dishes, or stir-fry bases. However, while rice has little nutritional value, quinoa is high in protein and packed with nutrients., The word “diet” has become synonymous with an extremely restrictive meal plan.The Atkins diet, grapefruit diet, South Beach diet, they all require you to give up an important part of balanced eating. In order to have a healthy body, your daily “diet” should be a combination of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and dairy.

, Drink at least 6-8 8oz. of water a day, you will notice a big difference in how you feel and how you look. It can be hard to drink enough between classes, so check your school rules and carry around a water bottle with you if allowed. Challenge yourself to drink one bottle in the morning and another in the afternoon.

, Late nights studying and playing games make sodas and energy drinks a tempting choice when your alarm goes off at 6:30.


Sodas contain aspartame which is like drinking rocket fuel, and it takes 50 minutes running to burn the calories in a regular soda!Diet sodas contain artificial sweeteners. These confuse your body, making you store fat and potentially leading to weight gain.Energy drinks are filled with added stimulants that your body doesn’t need and is a contributing factor in insomnia and anxiety., If you’re playing a sport, or an active person, you may want to hydrate with something more than water. However it’s important to read labels, because many sports drinks are unnecessarily high in calories or sodium.There should be around 15g of sugar for an 8 ounce bottle.
No more than 170mg of sodium for an 8 ounce bottle.
If your workout is less than 60 minutes there is no additional benefits your body will get from the sports drink compared to water., Caffeine is a stimulant, which means it’s going to give you an energy kick-start if you drink it. While that may seem like a positive, there are many negative side effects of caffeine, especially for teenagers. It can increase anxiety, irritability, headaches, or insomnia.That doesn’t mean you have to stop hanging out in your local coffee shop or give up your favorite Frappuccino, just limit your intake or as for it in decaf!

, Because your body is still growing and changing, working out regularly can be beneficial in building strong bones and maintaining a healthy weight. A well rounded workout plan includes cardio, weights, and stretching. Ask a trainer at your school or a local gym to get a plan that’s right for your body.Join a sports team at school. If you’re motivated by group activities and need an extra push to workout than joining a school team could be a good way to exercise regularly.
Get a workout video. If you have a busy, changing schedule than workout videos could be a great option. You can complete them at any time and in the comfort of your own room.
Join a gym. Many gyms gives discounts for students, and offer a variety of classes and weight room.

, Whether it’s your best friend, sibling, or friend from math class, having someone you workout with can be a great motivator. It can create some healthy competition and have someone hold you accountable for regular workouts.

, Once you establish a workout routine that you like, start setting short and long term goals. If you can only do 3 pushups, set a goal to double that by the end of the month. Keep a journal to record your progress so you can look back and remind yourself how far you’ve come! Good luck!

, Just like you, your friend’s body is also constantly changing. But that doesn’t mean it will change in the same way or the same rate. Don’t worry if your friend wears a bra before you or if you’re the only one of your friends with facial hair. Maturity happens at different times for everyone and there’s nothing wrong with that! You’ll all get there eventually and worrying about it won’t speed up or slow down your body.

, Having a healthy self-image is part of having a healthy body, and it’s easy to get caught up on your physical image.


Make a list of what you like about yourself beyond your body. Do you ace math tests? Have an awesome slam dunk? Run the student newspaper? Write it down and tape the list to your mirror.Cut out pictures of positive body role models. Whether it’s a celebrity that promotes healthy eating or your aunt that competes in triathlons, surround yourself with reminders of healthy living looks like.

, Everyone has aspects of their body they want to change, but usually what we see as blaring issues others don’t even notice! Find at least one part of your body you like and work on accentuating it for a confidence boost.

, We tend to mimic the habits of the people we spend the most time with. So if all of your friends are constantly talking negatively about their bodies, it will be hard for you to stay positive. Your friends are your support group, so help each other lead healthy lives!Instead of spending time staring at models in magazines with your friends, go for a walk or learn to cook together!
When trying on clothes with friends, change the conversation from “Do I look fat?” to “What does this outfit do for me?”

Follow the dietary guidelines recommended by the US Department of Agriculture.Fruits and vegetables should constitute half of each meal
Choose skim or 1% milk after age two
Choose whole grain breads, cereals, etc.
Switch up your sources of protein regularly

, Newborns to six month olds rarely need additional iron supplements if they are breast feeding or taking iron-fortified formula.Speak with your pediatrician to find out if supplements are necessary for your child. As your child gets older, his dietary requirements will change, so remember to adjust his diet.Babies between the ages of seven and 12 months require 11 milligrams of iron per day.
Children between one and three years old require seven milligrams of iron per day.
Children between four and 13 years old require between eight and 10 milligrams per day.
Requirements rise as children enter the teenage years., Heme is the easiest type of iron to digest and it aids the body in absorbing non-heme iron. Cook lean cuts of meat for your child and use healthy cooking methods such as baking, grilling, or broiling. Avoid fatty meats. Good meat-sources of iron include lean cuts of beef, chicken, and turkey. Salmon and tuna are also good sources of iron.

, Though these are not as easily absorbed by the body, they contain iron and should be consumed for other reasons. Provide your child with plenty of beans and legumes, as well as fresh iron-rich vegetables and dried fruits. Cereals can be extremely iron-rich. Plant sources are an important part of a healthy diet and are easily added to any recipe.


Popular iron-rich beans include soybeans, lentils, kidney beans, black beans, pinto beans, and garbanzo beans.
Vegetables that are high in non-heme iron include yellow peppers, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, artichokes, tomatoes and leafy green vegetables, such as kale and spinach.
Most fruits are not high in iron; however, dried fruits, prunes, raisins, and figs are a good source of non-heme iron.

, Replace high-sugar cereals that have very little nutritional value with healthy, iron-fortified cereals. Check the labels on ready-to-eat cereals and choose one that provides a significant amount of your child’s recommend daily iron allowance. Oatmeal and cream-of-wheat are also very high in non-heme iron.

, There are many iron-rich foods that don’t come from plants or meat. Be sure to include these to create a balanced diet for your child. Examples of non-meat and plant iron-rich foods are eggs, hummus, molasses, tofu, and enriched grains.

, If you have a picky eater, getting her to consume enough vitamins and nutrients may be difficult. Find recipes for kid-friendly meals that pack a big health punch. Until your child is old enough to realize the value of nutritional foods, you may need to get creative.


Cut up vegetables in foods your child likes. Pizza and macaroni and cheese are easy foods to supplement with sources of iron. Finely chop vegetables so they are less recognizable.

, Good sources of vitamin C include orange juice, strawberries, kiwis, grapefruit, cantaloupe, and mangoes. Take a vitamin C supplement if your doctor advises you to boost your intake.

, This type of cookware contains minute amounts of iron that seeps into food. This is another way to ensure that your child is consuming adequate amounts of iron. Make sure to clean your cast iron cookware properly.

The caffeine content of coffee and tea can have other side effects on your children's health. It is best to avoid their intake of these beverages entirely.

, Explain the effect that food can have on his or her body. Discuss the negative effects of eating unhealthy foods, and the health benefits of eating nutritious foods. Frame these discussions as making healthy choices rather than taking away junk food. Explain that it is fine to treat yourself once in a while, but to make sure it does not become too frequent.

, Rid the house of unhealthy junk foods and replace them with healthy, iron-fortified snacks and meals. Empty calorie foods have little to no nutritional value and contribute to unhealthy weight gain. Keeping healthier foods around the house will have reciprocal effects on your own nutrient intake.

, Explain the ways in which each ingredient is good for the body. Emphasizing the importance of preparing fresh foods to your children from an early age will instill healthy food habits. They should develop basic cooking capabilities as they age so that they do not resort to preservative-heavy foods in your absence.

, Bring your child with you on grocery shopping trips. Show him healthy snack options. As you select different ingredients, explain to him how each of those ingredients will be incorporated into a healthy meal. Show your child the variety of nutrients available in the produce aisle rather than packaged foods high in preservatives.

, Turn shopping and cooking into an event, and make your child a part of it. Find ways to make the presentation of your meal fun, such as using unique food shapes to create a picture on her plate. Remember that children love to dip their food. Assemble some dipping equipment for snacks and other dipped items.

, Children enjoy novelty items such as themed plates, specialty dipping cups, and kid-friendly utensils. These dishes can be found inexpensively and may have an impact on your child’s enthusiasm for mealtime.

, Excessive iron gradually builds up in the organs and tissues throughout the body. Though it is unlikely that your child gets too much iron from food, supplements are a different story. Unless otherwise instructed by your pediatrician, make sure your child gets no more than 40mg of iron per day.

, It may be difficult to recognize the symptoms because many of them resemble the same symptoms for low iron. However, some common symptoms of iron overload include weakness, fatigue, irritability, and skin discoloration. Make sure your supplements are out of reach of your child if you notice these symptoms, and make an appointment with your pediatrician.

Sack out your horse (get him/her used to the idea of you jumping on him/her).,
After trying this about 5-9 times, move on as long as your horse seems alright.,
After 'sacking your horse out' you may try mounting if you're comfortable.

,Have somebody hold your horse while you practice, eventually you should be able to do this by yourself (that's the whole idea)

,
If you mount on the left side place your right foot back and your left foot near your horses left front leg by it's hoof.

,
Take a liberal amount of mane along with the reins (so you don't lose control and if your horse has a skimpy mane it'll give you more to hold onto).

,
Then place all your weight onto your right leg.

,
With your momentum swing your right leg and arm over your horses back and try to get on.

,
If you fight for more than 30 seconds trying to get on, relax, slide off and pet your horse for standing still and letting you maul him/her!,
If you succeeded, good for you!,
Again, have somebody hold your horse and then begin.,
Place all your weight on your left foot.

,
Take some mane and reins and (MOMENTUM) use your momentum to swing yourself up on his/her back.

,
If you succeed then pat your horse and stay up there for a couple seconds.

,
Gently dismount and pat him/her.,
If you don't succeed don't worry about it, it takes practice, the key is over shooting your horse and using every ounce of momentum to your advantage.,
This does not happen overnight to most people, but with practice and time, you will be able to do it!

",How to Mount Without a Saddle or Block," You can do this by placing your hands on his back, and rubbing him/her for a while, then jumping beside him/her, then, when your horse has calmed down, you should get somebody else to hold the lead rope !!(DO NOT WRAP AROUND YOUR HAND! LOOP IT)!!(IF YOUR HORSE BOLTS or BUCKS the SKIN on YOUR HAND WILL BE GONE)!! while you gently start applying pressure to your hands on his back. Give little hops and jumps (like if you place your hands on the table and jump with your hands taking all the weight, only on his/her back).;
,(no laid ears back, tail swishing, white around the eyes or exaggerated arched back) if any of this is happening your horse is either irritated or scared. (Scared is last two)

,,,,,,, your horse needs to know you are proud of him/her. And that this is not a punishment.

, now try on the right side, unless your horse is never mounted there. but it is still good practice and will help you in the long run.

, When mounting on the right side, it's just the opposite. you place your right foot in front beside your horses front hoof with your left leg back.

,,,, reward is extremely important.

, strength is not key.

Move your horse into position.,
Check your horse's girth.,
Adjust your stirrup length.,
Keep the horse still.,
Move your mounting block in place.",How to Mount a Horse1," Walk your horse out to a level area for mounting. Make sure they aren’t cramped, as horses can get claustrophobic easily, making mounting more difficult. Traditionally, mounting occurs on the left side of a horse, but a well trained horse and balanced rider will be able to mount from either side.


It is important to be able to mount from both the right and the left, should you be in a dangerous situation (such as on a trail ride along a cliff edge) which requires you to quickly mount from a side you’re not necessarily used to.;
, The girth should be tight, but you should be able to fit two fingers between the girth and the horse's side. Riding with a loose or tight girth is dangerous for you and your horse, and trying to mount a horse with a loose girth can land you and the saddle on the ground. It's very important to check your horse's girth before mounting.

, Although you can adjust the length of your stirrups from the horse’s back, it’s much easier to do so before mounting. To get a relatively accurate gauge of your stirrup length, pull out the leathers/stirrup towards your torso. Place your hand on the saddle, so your arm is perpendicular to your torso. Adjust the stirrups so that they reach they length of your arm, extending till just about your armpit.


This method gives you a good foundation length, which can then be adjusted by a friend or yourself when in the saddle.

, Make sure the horse is paying attention to you, and isn’t trying to walk off. Put the reins over his head so they'll be in the correct position when you mount, and hold on to them to keep him still while you mount. If you're a beginner, ask a friend to hold your horse for you while you mount.

, Although it is not required, a mounting block can make reaching the stirrups a bit easier. Repeatedly mounting without a block puts a lot of strain on one side of your horse's back, so using a mounting block can help reduce that strain and protect their back. If you have a mounting block, move it so that it is just under the stirrup you will use to mount up with."

, Complex carbohydrates provide energy that lasts. The help with energy and digestion. Nutritionists recommend that teens’ caloric intake consist of about 50 – 60% complex carbs. The best sources of complex carbs are:Fruits
Starchy vegetables (such as potatoes and corn)
Green vegetables
Whole grains
Beans
Legumes (such as peas, soy, and peanuts)

, Less than 30% of a teenager’s diet should be fats. Fats help absorb important vitamins, including A, D, E, and K.


The best fats are unsaturated. They are found in foods such as olives, nuts, nut butters, avocado, olive oil, salmon, and anchovies.
The jury is still out on saturated fats. Some experts say that they lead to increased rates of heart disease, while others say that they are okay when eaten in moderation. In general, experts agree that a limited amount of red meat and whole milk are okay when paired with vegetables, fiber, and healthy fat. Trans fats are the bad ones. They are found in most commercially sold baked goods, fried foods, and box mixes. You can spot trans fat by looking for “partially hydrogenated oils.""

, They increase bone health and encourage strong teeth, both of which are key for your growing teen. Keep low-fat milk, cheese (such as mozzarella, swiss, ricotta, and cottage cheese) and yogurt in the house.

Greek yogurt with nuts and berries (you can buy them with the mix-ins or add your own)
Oatmeal with strawberries, peaches, or blueberries
Grapes and string cheese

, Sometimes, in order to get a teenager to eat veggies or whole wheat, you need to spice it up a bit with a delicious dip. You can also “hide” nutritious foods in the dip ingredients. Healthy options include:Black bean dip with whole grain crackers
Celery sticks and peanut butter
Low-fat ranch dressing with carrots, celery, broccoli, or peppers
Hummus and whole wheat pita chips
Whole wheat pretzels in spicy mustard
Rice cakes with a smear of peanut butter

, Almost every teen loves a cheesy snack. Try:Low-fat cheese on whole wheat toast
Low-fat cheese spread with whole grain crackers
Melted cheese in a whole wheat pita pocket
Cheese pizza on a whole wheat crust
Popcorn with parmesan cheese (no butter)
Whole wheat mini-bagel with cream cheese

, A good portion of the battle of getting teens to eat healthy snacks is making them interesting. Seek out new options whenever you can. Some things to try are:Edamame
Roasted almonds and dried cranberries
Smoothies, especially made with soy milk and lots of fruit
Trail mix (such as toasted cereal, nuts, and dried fruit)
Vegetable omelets
Tomato soup
Whole grain cereal and skim milk
Ice pops, made in the blender with fruit and frozen

, Consider taking them to the grocery store with you and letting them choose between healthy snack options. On Sunday evenings, ask them to help you prepare snacks for the week.


Try creating a Healthy Snacks Pinterest board or bookmarks folder that the whole family can contribute to. Let your teen choose among the options on the board or in the folder when it’s time to shop for and prepare snacks.

, Sometimes, as a busy parent, it will be nearly impossible for you to make healthy snacks at home. If you must offer store-bought snacks, choose the healthiest options possible.


Chips, candy, and soft drinks are an easy option when your teenager is hungry. If they are in the house, a teenager will eat them! Though you likely can’t prevent your teen from choosing these options at school or at the movies with their friends, you can provide better options at home.

, These convenient, portable snacks are often packed with sugar and fat. Most have added some vitamins and nutrients, but the amount of artificial flavorings and chemicals they contain usually outweigh the benefits. , These are every bit as convenient as a power bar, but offer a good variety of whole grains, nuts, and fruit. You can also pick up individual trail mix packets with similar ingredients.

, Greek yogurt offers a lot of protein, but any low-fat yogurt is a good option for teens on the go. , You can get these salted or unsalted, in bulk or individually wrapped. Be careful about portion control though, as nuts are high in calories. , These are a great option for a teen who tends to grab chips and dip, but they offer much more nutritional value than potato chips. You can also rotate in healthy dip options, such as hummus. , These packs come in every variety, from sweet treats to nuts to crackers. Some offer less nutritional value than others, but they are all portable and very limited in calories.

, Convenience is key here. Bananas, apples, pears, and oranges are very portable and easy to eat. If you want your teen to grab celery and carrots and don’t have time to cut them up yourself, you may have to opt for the more expensive pre-cut veggies.

, If you made a gigantic batch of granola for your teenager in hopes that they will choose this healthy option, all of your good intentions will fly out the window if they eat the whole thing in one sitting. Package snacks in small ziplock bags or tupperware. Even if you purchased a bag of snacks instead of making it, you can portion it out when you get home.
Ask your teen to help you portion out snacks for the week. This is a great time to teach them about portion control.

, Mindless overeating often happens because of distractions. It’s very easy to lose track of portion sizes if you are watching television or flipping through pictures on Instagram. , It takes about twenty minutes for your brain get the memo that your stomach is full. , The benefit of pre-packaged snacks is that they tell you exactly how many calories they contain. Foods you make at home are often a little trickier. Download them on your own phone, or encourage your teen to get them. Try some of these apps to help you determine what the correct portions are:

Position yourself next to your horse in preparation for mounting.,
Hold the reins in your left hand.,
Put your left foot in the stirrup.,
Stand on your left foot and swing your right leg over.,
Slowly sink into the saddle.",How to Mount a Horse2," Whether you're standing on a mounting block or on the ground, you should stand next to your horse's left front leg. This allows you to reach the stirrup easily without sacrificing control of your horse.

, Keep them tight enough that you can control your horse if it moves away, but be careful not to pull too hard on your horse's mouth.

, This is much easier when using a mounting block, but doable from the ground as well.


If you're mounting from the ground, drop your left stirrup several holes to make it easier to reach. You can shorten your stirrup to the right length once you're sitting on your horse.

, Your left hand should still be holding the reins, but you can grab the pommel of the saddle if necessary. Use your right hand to grab the pommel, a handful of mane at the base of your horse's neck, or the front of the saddle on the right hand side. Avoid grabbing the back of the saddle, as it's less secure and pulling on it can cause the saddle to slip.

, Landing hard in the saddle can hurt your horse's back, so be careful to land gently in the saddle. Adjust your stirrups if necessary, position the reins properly in your hands, and you're ready to go!

Stand at your horse’s side.,
Adjust your reins.,
Put your foot in the stirrup.,
Grab the front of the saddle.,
Pull yourself up.,
Swing your leg over.,
Sink into the saddle.,
Adjust your seat.",How to Mount a Horse3," As aforementioned, most riders mount from the left side but either the left or the right side is appropriate for mounting. Turn to face the saddle.

, You should have a good grip of the reins at all time during the mounting process, so that the horse doesn’t walk off from under you. Shorten the inside rein so that should you add pressure to the bit, your horse would just circle in on you while you cue it to stop., Lift your forward foot (the one closest to the horse’s head) into the stirrup, so that your weight is resting on the ball of your foot. If the saddle is too high off the ground or if you don’t have enough stretch in your leg, lift your leg with your arm or have a friend do the same.


If you’re using a mounting ramp, step onto the ramp prior to putting your foot in the stirrup.

, If you’re riding in a western saddle, use your forward hand to grab the horn. In an english saddle use your forward hand to grab the pommel.

, Step into the stirrup as if you were walking upstairs while gently pulling yourself up with your hand on the front of the saddle. You may put your other hand on the cantle of the saddle to help keep balance.


If you have a friend with you, have them counter-balance your saddle to keep it from sliding off by pushing down into the opposite stirrup.

, When you have pulled yourself up so that your belly is level with the seat of the saddle, swing your back leg up and over the rear end of the horse. Be careful not to bump or kick them with your foot.

, Slowly lower yourself into the saddle, so that you don’t ‘plop’ down and cause pain or discomfort to the horse. This may be slow-going to start, but over time you’ll be able to do this quickly and gently.

, When you are stable on the back of the horse, make minor adjustments to your seat and posture. Put your other foot in the stirrup, and adjust the length if necessary.

Tighten the girth right before mounting.,
Gather your reins in your left hand.,
Put your foot in the stirrup.,
Stop immediately if your horse moves.,
Reward your horse when it stops.,
Begin mounting.,
Push the horse back (optional).,
Repeat as many times as it takes.,
Get comfortable.",How to Get Your Horse to Stand Still for Mounting1," Feeling the saddle shifting to the side while riding is frightening both for horse and rider! You want to do this right before mounting because many horses tend to hold their breath when you first put the girth on, so when before you mount they tend to let it out, which may loosen the girth.;
, After checking the equipment, prepare to mount. Gather your reins and hold them firmly, but with a little slack. Yanking the reins while you mount may cause the horse to rear or protest. Wait until the horse is completely still before you continue


If you are a beginner, at a show, or if you do not have the time to be patient, have someone else take the reins and keep him still. In general, you are better off teaching him to stand correctly as described below, as it will greatly assist you in the future.

, Put your weight on the stirrup, not on your arms. Your hand can use the pommel for balance, but do not grab it tightly or pull yourself up with it. If you need a mounting block or a boost from another equestrian, get it.

, When the horse begins to move away, immediately remove your foot and take up the slack in the reins. Keep the reins short so the horse is forced to walk in a small circle. Wait until the horse stops moving, then start again. Repeat as many times as it takes to train your horse.


Be patient. Some horses will keep walking for some time. Trying to mount while they are still moving will teach them that they do not have to stand still.

, If the horse stops in response to your correction, reward him immediately with a pat or a kind word. If necessary, lead him back to where he was and attempt to mount again.


If he moves, correct him in a stern voice, but never slap or yell at him.
If the horse is stubborn and will not stop, just keep putting your foot in the stirrup, without trying to mount. When the horse finally stays still, reward it with a treat. Repeat until it consistently stays still for this stage.

, When he is completely still, you can start to swing your right leg over. If he starts to move while you are doing so, dismount completely and make him stop again. The horse will likely hate this aborted mount, which will help it learn to cooperate for a faster result.


Many horses take two weeks to become used to mounting for the first time.

, If you need to move the horse back to the starting position, apply pressure on his chest to send him moving backward. You can also try this on an impatient horse, to teach him that he will not get anywhere without you.

, Make sure you reward the horse for standing still. When he does not, you may correct him sternly, but do not punish him or shout. Just make sure not to give him treats or praise when he wanders off.

, Once you are seated, take an extra few moments to adjust your stirrups or tighten your girth as necessary. When you do decide to move, it should be your decision, not the horse's. Reward your horse for the patience, and enjoy the ride!

Know when you’re physiologically hungry and when you’re not.,
Recognize your emotional triggers.,
Feel the emotion that you’re trying to suppress.,
Manage stress with exercise.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Make incremental changes.,
Eat mindfully.,
Get support.,
Rethink your environment.,
Consider therapy.",How to Manage Emotional Eating on the Volumetrics Diet," Hunger pangs in your stomach and feelings of low energy are true signs of hunger. Because Volumetrics is designed to help you eat larger quantities of more nutritious foods, you may actually find that you are less physiologically hungry on the diet.;
, A variety of major life events and daily hassles can lead you to overeat. Dr. Rolls recommends becoming more mindful when you eat, which will make you more aware of the specific events that draw you into emotional eating.


Ask yourself how you’re feeling before you eat. If you’re experiencing a difficult moment, it could be that you’re misinterpreting those feelings of struggle with hunger.
If you’ve just finished a binge, then ask yourself what may have triggered the event.
Write your feelings in your Volumetrics food journal in addition to writing down what you eat. When you go over your journal entries, you will begin to notice behavior patterns that you can then empower yourself to change.

, In your food journal, write down the feeling and the alternative coping strategy that you used in place of reaching for more food.

, Follow Dr. Rolls’s advice and increase the number of steps that you take each day by 150 until you are taking 10,000 steps per day. Additionally, try yoga or meditation to help manage the stress in your life.

, Sometimes, people snack for an energy boost.


Something many people don’t know is that you actually slow down your weight loss progress if you don’t get enough sleep, so this step is particularly important. Make sure to get plenty of sleep each night or to take a nap when you’re sleepy.
Eating more whole foods like those recommended on Volumetrics means a slower release of carbohydrates, which means that your energy levels will be less volatile.

, Instead of changing everything at once, focus on one change each week. If the Volumetrics focus for the week is on controlling portion size, then focus on that change rather than trying to change your entire approach to eating.

, Minimize distractions such as computer and television. When you eat more slowly and mindfully, you will do a better job of recognizing when you are full. Learning what satiety feels like and eating more filling foods is part of the Volumetrics philosophy.

, Join a support group, diet and exercise with a friend or group, or join an online Volumetrics forum to discuss weight loss challenges and exchange healthy recipes. The support of friends, family and even online acquaintances can help you to feel like you aren’t alone on your weight loss journey.

, This is actually the focus of Week 11 of the Volumetrics 12-week plan.


Remove tempting foods from your house.
Choose to have alcohol only when you are away from home.
Cook healthier meals for your family.

, Talking to a therapist, particularly one who has expertise in eating disorders and other food-related issues, can be especially helpful when you have exhausted your other alternatives.

Make sure the horse is still and calm.,
Hold the reins and mane in your left hand.,
Remove your right foot from the stirrup.,
Pivot your right foot over the horse's rear.,
Finish dismounting (one foot).,
Finish dismounting (both feet).,
Lead the horse.",How to Dismount a Horse1," Never dismount until the horse has stopped moving completely. If the horse is spooked or inexperienced, calm it before dismounting. Pat it gently and speak to it in a soft tone of voice until it becomes still. Shift your weight around slightly while you calm the horse, so it won't be surprised when you move to dismount.;
, Move both reins to your left hand. Keep holding them for the duration of the dismount, but take care to give them some slack and not to yank them suddenly. While holding the reins, grip the horse's mane. This will help stabilize you, and will not hurt the horse.


Most horses are trained for dismounts on the left side, and may spook if you try to dismount on the right.

, Stand up in the stirrups, gripping the saddle pommel with your right hand for balance if necessary. Tip your right toe down to remove your foot from the right stirrup. Continue immediately to the next step, turning it into one fluid motion.


If you are using an English saddle without a raised pommel, grip the front by curling your fingers under the front edge of the saddle instead. Also, you may be more familiar with the term ""iron"" in place of ""stirrup.""

, Learn your body forward over the front of the saddle, and bring your free right foot well up and over the rear of the horse, onto the left side. Be careful not to kick the horse's rear while you do so, as this can cause the horse to spook and start moving.


As you complete the motion with your right foot, you can move your right hand to grip the saddle's cantle (raised rear portion) for balance.
While you may use your foot in the left stirrup for balance, do not push outward while you pivot. This could pull the horse and start it moving.

, There are two common ways to complete the dismount, each described in this section. To dismount on one foot, simply lower your right foot to the ground, keeping your left foot in the stirrup and your hands on the pommel and cantle (front and rear) of the saddle. Flex your knee slightly as you land to absorb the impact, make sure the horse is not moving, then use your right hand to lift your left foot out of the stirrup.


You must be tall enough to reach the stirrup with your left foot from the ground. If you are not, you'll need to dismount onto a raised platform, or use the ""both feet"" method below.
If you feel the horse start to move as you dismount, you can ""bounce"" up from the ground as you land and back into the saddle, to avoid falling. If you are not strong or experienced enough to do this, this method can lead to a dangerous situation.

, Alternatively, complete the dismount by pushing your left foot gently out of the stirrup as well, then sliding along the horse's belly to the ground. Complete this motion fluidly, without pausing, and flex your knees as you land.


This dismount method can be performed from any height, and also carries no risk of getting your foot caught in the stirrup of a moving horse.
Do not flail or shake your leg to get it out of the stirrup, as this could spook the horse. Instead, gently push against it, or pull up with your arms, to raise yourself higher, and lift your foot out.

, Since you have held onto the reins this entire time, it is now easy to walk the horse from the ground. Before moving, put the stirrups up to prevent them knocking against the horse or getting caught on obstacles.

Consider reasons the horse may misbehave.,
Try mounting in a different location.,
Check the tack for suitability and fit.,
Analyse your mounting.,
Analyse your riding.,
Analyze the activities you do.,
Have your horse checked for soundness by a professional.",How to Get Your Horse to Stand Still for Mounting2," If the horse is young or spirited, it is most likely just bored by standing still. Similarly, a horse exposed to a new location, new people or animals, or even just a change in weather will often be less cooperative. The instructions below are only necessary for horses that persistently refuse to stand still, with no simple reason for their behavior.

, If the horse refuses to cooperate, try taking it to a different place. For example, mount in the arena if you normally mount in the stables. Sometimes, a horse may be distracted or agitated by something you do not even notice. If you can successfully train it in the new location, you may try again in other places. If possible, try to locate the issue, so you can either eliminate the problem or train for it.

, This includes the girth, saddle, martingale, breast collar, bridle and anything else you put on the horse. Fit means the right size, shape, and how and where you place them. If you're not sure how to check your tack, have an experienced rider help you.

, If your horse misbehaves when being mounted, he or she may dislike being mounted. Here are some factors to consider:


Do you get better results when you mount from a mounting block, or from the ground?
Does he cooperate better when other horses are around, or when he is alone?
Try to enter the saddle gently, if you currently slam down with force the horse may react strongly.

, A horse may resist being ridden if you are unbalanced, or if you keep yourself steady by pulling the reins. The best way to fix these issues is to enroll in a lesson with a good instructor.

, Some horses dislike certain types of riding. Give them something to enjoy instead:


If you never leave the school, try a ride outside it.
If you train only for one discipline, or spend all your time at one pace, switch it up a little. A horse that sweats and blows a lot is probably overworked, while a horse that strains may want to gallop.
If you spend all your time hacking alone, invite some friends alone.

, A persistent dislike of being mounted may suggest an unsound horse. Although a professional can be expensive, this may be your only option for a horse that hasn't improved after several weeks of training.

Give them choices.,
Make mealtime fun.,
Set regular meal times.,
Don’t rely on bargaining.,
Set a good example.",How to Stop Your Kids from Skipping Meals1," Usually, when toddlers and small children refuse to eat it is part of a “power play.” They want to be in control, and want to push the boundaries to see just how much control they have. If you provide an element of choice when mealtime arrives, you can give them a measure of independent control while making sure they eat something healthy.No matter how your parents (or their parents) did things, don’t plop down a big scoop of broccoli and tell the child that he can’t get up until the plate is empty. Try offering small amounts of several nutritious options — a little bit of broccoli, some corn, a few carrots — and let the child decide which one (or more) he wants to eat more of.
Ask for input on the daily menu, while subtly steering your children toward healthier alternatives — grilled chicken strips instead of fried chicken nuggets, for instance.;
, Mealtime is important, and eating needs to be the focus, but that doesn't mean it has to feel like a chore or even a punishment. If you can make preparing, presenting, and consuming nutritious foods more enjoyable, your kids might just become eager participants in mealtime.Let kids help prepare the meals. Most kids don't like cleaning dishes, but they sure love getting them messy. Let them help with the mixing, stirring, tossing, etc. Accept the mess that is sure to occur as part of the process.
Make creative or silly shapes out of the foods you serve. A simple cookie cutter can do wonders for a kid's sandwich. Make up silly names to go with the silly shapes. Search for healthy, quick, fun-shaped kids' recipes online.Play games during mealtime. Between courses, or after your child has eaten a certain portion of the food on his or her plate, have a quick game of ""I spy"" or ""What's missing?"" Or, have a sing-along or make up a silly story together.

, Some kids don’t seem to ever want to eat, while others will snack all day if you let them. Small children need to learn to identify and respond to their own hunger cues, and at the same time grow accustomed to the framework of regular meal times.It is important that kids not skip meals, but it isn’t the end of the world if a toddler or small child refuses to eat anything at the occasional meal time. Simply wait until the next regular snack or meal time and offer new options again. Don’t try to make up for a missed meal or snack by letting the child “graze” on whatever she wants in between normal times for eating.

, Every parent has at some point resorted to saying something like “If you eat the rest of your asparagus, you can have some ice cream.” It feels like a fair and worthwhile trade at the time, but it actually turns dessert into the more valuable food group and an expectation, rather than an occasional indulgence. Resist the temptation to make lopsided deals for the sake of harmony and an empty plate.Try never to make dessert dependent upon the rest of the meal. Have cake because it’s grandma’s birthday or because you got a promotion, not because your child finished a pork chop.
Although you should teach your child the importance of not wasting food, it is better to have some food wasted than to make sweet treats the regular trade-off for cleaning the plate. Rely on small portion sizes and frequent plate refills to limit wastage.

, If you are regularly too busy, too distracted, or simply lack the interest to stop and have a meal, a small child will interpret this as meaning meals are not all that important. Alternatively, if you prioritize having regular, nutritious meals, a child will interpret mealtime as being more important. “Do as I say, not as I do” doesn’t work when it comes to mealtime.You shouldn’t force a child to eat something, but you do control what foods are in the house in the first place. Shop healthy, and the meal options you provide will be better for everyone’s health.
It may be more challenging today to get everyone together for mealtimes, but do what you can to make eating meals a regular, shared, important experience.

Put your reins in your hands to hold them, make sure that they are not twisted, and put them inside your closed fists with your thumb folded over your reins, also, the reins should flow between your ring finger and pinky.",How to Mount and Dismount a Horse Properly1," It is important to use a mounting block so that you do not strain the horse's back muscles. Imagine if a person tried to climb up on top of you! If you do not have a mounting block, use the side of the arena, a block jump standard, or get someone to give you a leg up (see tips) or if you can reach the horses stirrup from the ground, use the ground.;
, This way, you do not have to jump across to get onto your horse.

, Gather the reins in the left hand and, if you need to, grip a bit of mane with the left hand.

,, Be sure not to kick your horse while doing so! This could cause him to move forward and unbalance you.

, Make sure the ball of your foot is centered in the stirrup and your heels are down and close to the horse's body.

, Place the excess or ""bite"" of your reins going to the right side.

Request assistance from sidesaddle.,
Hop down from bareback.,
Slide down from bareback instead.",How to Dismount a Horse2," If you are riding sidesaddle, with both legs on one side of the horse, ask someone to help lift you down. Jumping down on your own often causes your clothing to snag on the tack, and makes it difficult to keep hold of the reins.

, If riding bareback, one option is to bring your right foot over the horse's neck. Be careful not to hit your horse's neck as you do so, or it could easily spook. Once both feet are on the left side, hop down to the ground.


Do not attempt this from a saddle, as it is too easy to snare yourself in the tack.

, Another bareback dismounting method is very similar to the dismount for western or english saddles. Swing your right leg clear over the horse's rump, then slide down the belly onto the ground. Since you have no saddle to hold onto, you will need to perform this motion quickly and fluidly to avoid unbalancing yourself.

Provide healthy food options.,
Get your teen involved.,
Talk about the importance of regular, healthy eating.,
Encourage and demonstrate a positive body image.,
Watch for signs of an eating disorder.",How to Stop Your Kids from Skipping Meals2," Trying to get smaller kids and bigger kids to eat can present very different challenges, but some solutions are the same regardless of age. A fifteen-year-old wants to be in control just as much as a five-year-old, so provide multiple nutritious options that enable a teen to have a say in the mealtime experience.Ask for your teen’s input on grocery lists and mealtime menus. Try to accommodate his preferences while prioritizing healthy meal options.
Make reasonable compromises to get your teen to eat something at mealtime, but don’t give in to a desire for just junk food for the sake of getting him or her to eat. Occasional skipped meals because “there’s nothing good to eat” are less important than promoting good overall eating habits.

, A sixteen-year-old isn't going to be enthralled by getting to stir the cake batter or having a sandwich shaped like a turtle, but there are ways to add interest and involvement in mealtime for teens. Even if she probably won't admit to liking mealtime with the family, you may be able to coax a few smiles out of her.Give each child, including teens, regular roles to play during mealtime. It can be setting the table, clearing the dishes, and so on. It might not be considered fun, but it does stress the consistency of mealtime and the importance of each person's involvement.
Depending upon your teen's culinary instincts, you can let her prepare the meal, lend a hand, or just suggest the menu. If your teen is cooking, you can take over her usual mealtime task.
Let your teen invite a friend over for mealtime. It will make her happy, and it gives you a chance to get to know a bit more about who your teen is hanging out with.

, Most teens don’t want to be lectured about why eating nutritious meals is important, but they do want to be treated like grown-ups. Strive to engage your teen in a two-way conversation on the subject, giving him space to respond and listening to his questions, concerns, and opinions.Arm yourself with the information you need first. Read up on studies showing that skipping meals regularly causes blood sugar fluctuations (which negatively impact mood, health, and performance), nutritional deficiencies (that affect mental and physical health), and negative food behaviors (like binge eating, overeating, and poor food choices).Talk about how eating nutritious meals more consistently can help him achieve goals he already has, like making the varsity team or getting an “A” in biology.

, A child of any age benefits from seeing you make eating regular and healthy meals a priority. Some teens, though, may be skipping meals due to a misguided desire to lose or keep off weight. In such cases, any positive modeling and reinforcement you can provide in regards to body image and self-esteem can be particularly helpful.Never criticize any child’s weight or appearance, but also don’t criticize your own in front of her. Set healthy goals for improvement as warranted, but express comfort with your own body image. Emphasize health, not appearance.
Compliment your teen for making healthy choices, and encourage her efforts at self-improvement without being critical or negative.

, Most older kids who regularly skip meals do so because they feel like they don’t have enough time to eat, or because they are trying to assert their independence (by not “playing by your rules”). If you suspect that meals are being skipped due to an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia, though, do not hesitate to take action.Teens can change eating habits and preferences regularly, but watch for unexplained changes — skipping meals frequently, eating only small amounts, not liking former favorite foods, etc. — as possible signs of an eating disorder. Watch also for changes in mood and physical appearance.
Broaching the subject of a possible eating disorder can be very challenging. Be forthright with your concerns but compassionate in tone. Don’t hesitate to consult a doctor, therapist, or nutrition expert for advice. Get professional help for your teen as needed. Eating disorders can quickly become serious health issues.

Set aside time for breakfast.,
Have healthy on-the-go options available.,
Discuss the benefits of eating breakfast.,
Make pancake faces.",How to Stop Your Kids from Skipping Meals3," Sitting down at the table together for breakfast may seem like an antiquated notion out of a 1950s TV show; however, modern research continues to confirm just how important breakfast is to overall health, so make every possible effort to prioritize breakfast and carve out time for it each day.Set slightly earlier bedtimes to give enough time for breakfast. Rely on quick, nutritious breakfasts like cold cereal or yogurt with granola, a banana, multigrain toast, and orange juice. Keep it simple, so you don't have to turn into a short-order cook in the morning.
If it’s possible for you to eat breakfast together, do it — it makes it feel like the priority it should be.

, If the sit-down breakfast just isn’t going to happen in your household, don’t let your kids head out the door empty-handed — or with a toaster pastry full of sugar and saturated fat. Prepare nutritious options ahead of time that can be eaten on-the-go.Fresh fruit (like bananas, apple slices, or orange wedges), dried fruit and nuts, yogurt cups or squeeze tubes, smoothies, cereal or granola bars, or containers of dry breakfast cereal can all make good on-the-go options. Just keep an eye out for sugar content in prepackaged items.
Try to make these the emergency option and not the daily routine. A full, nutritious breakfast is the best alternative.

, Depending upon the age of the kids you’re dealing with, providing information on the importance of eating breakfast may prove helpful. Teens that are worried about school performance and/or physical appearance, for instance, might be convinced of the value of making time for breakfast.


Around 10% of younger kids and 25% of teens regularly skip breakfast, which tends to decrease school performance by reducing concentration and energy levels. It also tends to cause weight gain by encouraging overeating later in the day.For smaller kids, use positive peer pressure when possible. If they see or know of other kids like them (siblings, friends, etc.) who eat healthy breakfasts, they are more likely to decide to follow suit., A couple of strawberries and blueberries, and maybe a slice of bacon, can give an ordinary pancake quite a personality. No matter what is on the menu, look for ways to make breakfast fun enough to make your kids want to stop, sit, and eat for a bit in the morning.If your kid likes to point out animals and other shapes in the clouds, why not try the same thing with scrambled egg pieces? Try out fun little games and naming contests to make breakfast more fun.
Teens may be a bit trickier, but try at least to involve them in selecting (and perhaps preparing) the breakfast menu.

, Try to limit eating junk food, like French fries, hamburgers, and soda pop. Only eat when you're hungry. If you eat too much without noticing, you will not be as confident of yourself.

Take naps, if you feel the need.",How to Stay Fit in Middle School," Doctors advise that middle schoolers get at least an hour of physical activity every day: that’s 60 minutes of moderate aerobic activity like walking or intense activity like running. Regular exercise will give you stronger bones and better skin, help you keep a stable weight, and give you mental and mood boosts.Do things you enjoy! Exercise doesn’t have to be a chore. Do you like to rollerblade, play basketball, dance, or ride your bike? These are all great — and fun — physical activities.
Playing is a natural part of being an adolescent, too. Get some friends and play a game outdoors, for example, like Capture the Flag.
Limit your screen time. One of the biggest culprits behind inactivity is electronic devices: TV, computers, phones, tablets, and other touch screens. Try to make your screen time less than two hours a day.;
, Consider joining an organized sport, either on a team or a school-sponsored club. Most middle schools and high schools support these activities for the health and social benefits they give.Team sports are a great way to stay fit and exercise. They are also a great place to make new friends, learn cooperation and leadership skills, and meet role models. Try a team sport like field hockey, volleyball, or soccer.
Not into team sports? That’s OK, there are plenty of non-team sports like track and field, golf, or gymnastics.
There are also less competitive chances to play team sports. Try a rec league, for example, or find pickup basketball games at the park. Live up north? Play some shinny at a rink or pond.

, Working out at a gym is not something you need to do to be fit and healthy; however, you might want to. At the very least, it will help you fit regular exercise into your busy schedule.


Consider joining an aerobic exercise class at a nearby gym, like gymnastics, dance, or indoor cycling.
What about weights? Weight and resistance exercises are usually OK if done under supervision of an adult. Strength training promotes stronger muscles and bones, can improve your skill in other sports, and increases self-confidence.However, middle schoolers should keep it light and not put too much stress on their developing tissues. Some resistance training is OK, but the focus should not be about big muscles, i.e. serious weight-lifting or body building. Talk to an adult about working with a trainer to learn proper technique and to help you develop a safe, effective strength training program based on your age, size, and skills., While in middle school, you will enter your teens (or be in your ""tween"" years), and your body will change a lot during this time. This is normal: girls usually enter puberty between 10 – 11 years old, while boys start a bit later at 11 – 13. You’ll get taller, bigger, stronger, and will look physically different than before.Since you’re growing, your body needs more energy and you’ll probably eat more. It’s pretty common to gain some weight during puberty.
Getting bigger doesn’t mean that you are unhealthy, unfit, or overweight. Just remember: the important thing is to eat a healthy diet and keep active.
Everyone’s body is also different. Some people are naturally tall, some skinny, some short. Everyone has their own body type, and that’s OK.
We can’t control our natural body types. But we can control our physical fitness.

, You should be eating regular meals to give your body the energy and nutrients it needs, especially since you’re growing. Usually this means three meals (plus a snack or two) a day, including vegetables, fruit, lean meat, dairy, and whole grains.Always eat breakfast. As they say, it’s the most important meal. A good breakfast will give you energy throughout the day and get your energy and metabolism going. Aim for things like muesli and yoghurt, oatmeal, or scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast.Pick healthy school lunches. Cafeteria food isn’t all bad, but some of it isn’t the healthiest. Choose fruits and vegetables, eat less high-fat food like hotdogs, burgers, and fries, and avoid packaged snacks.Packing your own lunch will let you ensure it’s healthy. Just make sure to include your favorite healthy foods. You might pack a turkey and swiss cheese sandwich, whole wheat crackers, and skim milk, for example. Or, you might pack leftover pasta and a green salad.

, Fruits and veggies are packed with vitamins and are a key part of a balanced diet. Middle schoolers should be eating at least five portions a day, whether they are fresh, frozen, cooked, or dried.


What counts as a portion? Two or more small fruits like plums, a large fruit like an apple, or five pieces of dried fruit are one portion.For vegetables, about four large spoonfuls of fresh green or three spoonfuls of cooked veggies like spinach, carrots, or broccoli count.
You can count fruit or veggies cooked in a stew, pasta, or soup towards your daily “five.” Frozen, canned, or dried fruit like raisins, dates, and figs are also OK.Try to limit the amount of vegetables and fruit you eat in juice and smoothies. These drinks tend to be high in sugar and calories and are not so good for your teeth.

, Adolescents and teens need more of some nutrients than others. This is especially true for calcium for bone growth and, for girls that are menstruating, added iron.Middle school students and those nine to 18 years old need 1,300 mg of calcium per day.This equals about four 8 oz. glasses of milk or 8 oz. of yoghurt, 1 ½ oz. of hard cheese, or 2 cups of low-fat cottage cheese.
Teenage girls need more iron than boys, about 15 mg per day as opposed to 11 mg, to make up for iron lost during menstruation. Rich iron sources are chicken, beef, oysters, clams, and eggs, but also spinach, nuts, and asparagus.
The body more easily absorbs iron from animal protein. But you can help the absorption of plant-based iron by eating it with vitamin-C rich foods. For example, if you have rice and beans (which contain iron) have it topped with sautéed peppers for vitamin C. This way, you will get the most out of your iron source.

, Sweet, fatty, or salty snacks are delicious but not the best choice for your health. They tend to have fewer (or no) nutrients and more calories, which can lead to weight gain or vitamin deficiencies. You don’t have to give them up entirely, but make them an occasional treat.Avoid soda. Soda tastes good but has few nutrients. It’s also very bad for your teeth. Ideally, drink water. Low- or zero-calorie beverages like caffeine herbal tea can be healthy, too.Choose nutritious snacks. This usually means that chips, biscuits, fruit roll-ups, and other sweets are out. Try things like whole wheat toast and peanut butter, pita chips and hummus, or baked sweet potato chips, instead.Don’t feel you need to give up your favorite sweets or snacks entirely. Treating yourself once in a while isn’t a bad thing. It’s having a healthy diet overall that counts., Adolescents and teens need more sleep than adults because their bodies are developing. Too little can mean you won’t be at your best in school, on the sports field, or at play. This can be hard, though. Make an effort to get your share.


Middle schoolers between 10 and 13 years old should get between nine and 11 hours of sleep each night. 14 and older need eight to 10 hours.What is stopping you from getting sleep? Actually, a lot. Early school days, homework, sports, TV shows, games, and electronic devices can steal hours from you each day.
Try setting up a healthy sleep schedule with your parents. For example, you might decide to go to bed at 9:30 pm every school night and get up at 6:30 am. That’s 9 hours of rest every day.
You can indulge from time to time by staying up and sleeping in on weekends. The important thing is that you stick to a regular schedule as much as possible.

, Apart from a schedule, set up an environment and rhythm that will let you power down and get needed rest. You can do this naturally, by making changes to your daily routine.


Resist the urge to stay up late. Try to avoid getting sucked into television, texting, or phone conversations after 9 pm.
You might also get ready for bed by incorporating relaxing activities into your evening ritual, like taking a shower or reading a book.
Did you know that phones, tablets, and laptops can hurt the quality of your sleep, as well? The light stops your brain from making sleep-inducing chemicals. Try to power down at least 30 minutes before bed.Cut out caffeine, too. That cola you drank at 5 pm is still in your system at 10pm, and the caffeine might be keeping you up. Try to avoid caffeinated beverages like soda, tea, or coffee 6 hours before your bedtime., Napping is OK if you feel tired or run-down. Your body is telling you that you need a bit more rest. In fact, you might find a thirty-minute nap after school is a good pick-me-up.Nap, but don’t nap too much or too long. Limit your snoozes to less than one hour. Otherwise, you might end up disrupting your sleep pattern and end up staying up late.

Walk or ride your bike to school instead of driving, and take the stairs instead the elevator (unless you’re going up more than three flights).

For example, if your family eats a lot of deep-fried foods, you may want to switch to steaming, sautéing, and eating more fresh veggies. Fresh veggies may be a new thing for your family, so you should communicate your desire to have more of them on hand at home.
You may want to learn how to cook for yourself if your family does not cook the way that you know you should.

, If you choose to have sex, it is important to avoid STDs and pregnancy. Always use a condom. Do keep in mind that abstinence is the only 100% effective way to avoid these things.


Talk to your parents or a trusted adult if you have questions about sex. It’s okay to feel uncomfortable talking about sex, but you should do it anyways to ensure you’re getting reliable information. Initiate the conversation by texting or emailing your parents a link to some sexual information you read online and asking them if it is accurate. You might also talk to them about their own sexual histories by asking, “When did you start dating?” and leading to more private questions like, “When did you first have sex?”
If you are a girl, talk to your doctor about getting a long-acting reversible contraceptive or a birth control prescription.
Never have sex just because your boyfriend or girlfriend is pressuring you to. If you aren’t ready, be calm but firm in your refusal. Explain that you are not ready to have sex and insist that if they really love you, they will respect your decision.
Remember, having sex means that you run the risk of pregnancy. The safest sex is no sex at all. Sex includes the risk of pregnancy and infection with a sexually transmitted disease.

Limit your sugar intake.Foods like pie, candy, and chocolate taste great, but they have few of the nutrients your body needs to stay healthy.,
Avoid processed foods.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Drink lots of water.,
Eat healthy portions.",How to Stay Healthy As a Teen3," Instead, a high sugar content leads to an accumulation of fat.


Limiting your sugar intake doesn’t mean you can never eat cake or drink soda. It just means that these things should not be regular elements in your daily diet. Think of them as special treats.
Other high-sugar foods you should avoid include popsicles, candy, chocolate bars, ice cream, sweetened fruit juices, cookies, and sweetened cereals. Even some foods that might seem healthy like canned fruit and dried fruit have high sugar content.
Instead of eating high-sugar foods, try naturally sweet flavors like grapes, strawberries, peaches, pineapples, oranges, blackberries, blueberries, and mangos.
Try artificial sweeteners like Stevia instead of sugar in drinks.

, Processed foods are high in salt and fat, which can lead to hypertension, heart disease, and obesity. Avoid fast food, potato chips, and cheese snacks. It’s okay to have these foods once in awhile, like when you’re busy all day; however, you should limit the amount of processed foods that you eat because of their serious negative health impacts over the long-term.


If you’re unsure what foods are processed and which are unprocessed, look at the label. If there are lots of ingredients with long names that you can’t define (for instance, monosodium glutamate and butylated hydroxyanisole), you’re looking at a processed food. Alternately, avoid foods whose nutrition labels list fat content and sodium levels that are through the roof, especially when the serving size is relatively small.Processed foods that you should learn to avoid include potato chips, cheesy snacks, pre-packaged pastries, and gummy snacks.
Ask your parents not to buy these snacks so that you don’t have to deal with the temptation of wanting to eat them. Encourage them to instead buy whole grains, fruits, and veggies. Carrots with hummus, radish slices and guacamole, and apples with a sprinkle of cinnamon make great snacks.

, A healthy diet consists primarily of whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, with a small amount of lean protein and dairy products. You can get whole grains in whole grain bread, bagels, and pasta. Fresh vegetables like spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, and kale will keep you feeling energized. Fruit like apples, strawberries, and bananas will give you the nutrients you need to get through the day.


Try to eat a variety of healthy foods each day. Swap them out from time to time so you don’t get bored with eating the same thing.
If you aren’t used to eating a healthy diet, start small. For instance, instead of snacking on chips, try snacking on grapes or some crunchy carrots.Consider taking a daily multi-vitamin to ensure you get the nutrients you need.
Eat a healthy breakfast. Studies show that people who eat breakfast tend to feel fuller throughout the day and eat a smaller lunch and dinner.Try granola, a bowl of tasty fruit, or some toast with jam. Avoid sugary foods like toaster treats and sweetened cereals.

, Water keeps you hydrated, which is good for regulating body temperature, bodily functions, and mind. It also keeps your complexion healthy and helps you stay cool during the hotter months. For a hint of citrus flavor, squeeze a lemon into your water.Try to drink at least eight glasses of water each day. If you’re exercising a lot, drink a bit more to stay hydrated.

, Don’t starve yourself. The pressure on teens to look good is immense.Teens often try crash diets (diets that dramatically reduce daily caloric intake) in an effort to meet the expectations of their peers and society; however, these diets are not recommended and can even be dangerous. They can lead to imbalances in nutrition and leave you feeling sluggish.


Crash diets can actually have an effect opposite to the one you want, since they push your body into “starvation mode” and make it temporarily impossible for you to lose weight.
In addition to starvation diets, don’t engage in binging/purging (bulimia). If you suffer from an eating disorder or have body-image issues, talk to a licensed therapist or your school’s mental health counselor.

Avoid processed foods.,
Talk with a doctor before giving medication.,
Massage your child.,
Make toilet-training a positive experience.,
Keep your toddler active.,
Watch for signs of functional constipation.,
Consider what is an average bowel movement for a toddler.",How to Prevent Constipation in Toddlers," Offer your child at least 32 ounces of water or diluted juice every day. Try to make 75% of that water, since juice contains sugar that can cause diarrhea. This extra fluid in the stool will make it softer and easier to pass.To dilute juice, add 1 ounce of water for every ounce of juice. Avoid using juices that have sugar added. Consider diluting prune, pear, or apple juice.;
, If your child is between one and three years of age, she should get 19 grams of fiber a day. If she's between four and eight years of age, she should get 25 grams of fiber a day.Fiber is critical in helping bulk up stools. To increase the amount of fiber in your child's diet, offer:Fruits (leave the skins on since they contain fiber): pears, prunes, apples, figs and peaches.
Berries: blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries.
Unprocessed whole grains which contain the bran (the outer layer of the cereal grain): oat, wheat, corn and rice bran.
Beans: a variety can also offer minerals, but introduce these slowly because your toddler may get gassy.
Vegetables: leafy green vegetables (like mustard, collard, turnip greens, beet greens, spinach, kale, swiss chard), broccoli, Brussels sprouts, squash, cabbage, cauliflower, peas and carrots.
Nuts and seeds (including ground flax seeds): Only offer these to children over 5 years of age since they may be a choking hazard in younger children.

, Processed foods are usually high in sugars and low in fiber. This combination can cause diarrhea, add extra calories, lead to obesity, and contribute to childhood diabetes (all of which are on the rise). You should also avoid foods that have a binding effect which makes constipation worse.Avoid or cut down on these foods for a while:


Unripe or green bananas
Dairy products: milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream
Red meat
White rice

, Monitor your child's stools for at least five days once you've started hydrating and increasing fiber. If you don't notice an improvement, talk with your child's doctor about recommending an over-the-counter stool softener designed for children.Realize that using any sort of suppository, laxative or stool softener can make the problem worse in the long-term because your child can come to rely on these for bowel movements. However, short-term use of medications until dietary changes take effect can be safe and effective, especially if constipation is severe.


Suppositories and enemas can be a traumatic experience for your toddler, so you should try to avoid using these if possible.

, Stimulate your child's bowels by gently massaging his tummy. Use gentle, circular motions to apply pressure. Start at the lower right part of the belly and massage in the circular motions up and then across the belly. Keep doing this down to the lower left part of the belly. Be prepared in case the massage stimulates a normal bowel movement.


Never press hard. You may feel a mass, especially at the lower left part of the belly. This is normal. You are just feeling the stool. Avoid the temptation to push down hard on this mass.

, If you force toilet-training, your child may become stressed, causing her to actively resist bowel movements. Your child may see toilet training as a punishment and something to be avoided. Instead, make it a pleasant experience. Reward your child for using the toilet and spend the time that your child is on the potty reading to her or telling her a story. Stay with her the whole time, remaining happy and positive.Try getting your toddler in the habit of sitting on the potty shortly after eating, for about 10 minutes, each day.
Your toddler may be exploring the areas of her life that she can control, which includes pooping (to some extent). Work with her to toilet train. Don't simply force her.

, The act of walking or running actually keeps the contents of the bowels massaged making activity a natural remedy for constipation. Try to let your toddler run around and play for at least one hour a day.


Show your child how to slither on his stomach. This is a great way to put direct pressure on the bowels, helping to loosen stools., Your child is considered to be constipated if she's under four years old and is experiencing two of the following conditions:Two or fewer bowel movements per week
Loss of control over bowel movements (fecal incontinence) at least once a week after learning to use the toilet
A history of holding in her stool or resisting potty training
A history of painful or difficult bowel movements
The presence of a large stool in the rectum
A history of large stools that may block the toilet

Imagine your child touching her thumb and index finger together, making a circle. If your child's stools are larger than the diameter of that circle, she may be uncomfortable passing stools.



, There's a wide range of what's considered to be ""normal"" frequency of bowel movements, just like for adults. Most infants pass two to four stools a day. By the time they get a little older, toddlers consolidate their bowel movements and pass between one to two stools a day.


If your child tends to have fewer bowel movements but does not show any discomfort or difficulty, that is probably what's normal for your child."

Stay away from white bread., Stay away from foods high in fat, sugar, and sodium--this means avoiding any sort of junk food and fast food., It will also help you change your eating habits.

, This is called portion-controlling your food. When you get the urge to eat, distract yourself, chew on gum or drink water. When you do eat, only eat until you are full and then stop--don't stuff yourself! Studies show that your brain can't tell that you are full until about ten minutes after you really are. If you still feel hungry after a meal, wait ten minutes. If you are still hungry, don't starve yourself. Try having a healthy snack.

, Believe it or not; but by just doing that simple thing your body will process the food quicker making your metabolism faster. It also makes your stomach feel better if you are feeling bloated.

Do not remove your fish, decorations, or plants from the tank.;
, There are two tools aquarium hobbyists will use for cleaning their gravel.


Aquarium siphons usually have a thick, plastic tube or ""siphon"" with a thin, flexible, tube attached to one end. Some of these may have a priming ball attached to one end.
Plastic, flexible tubes can also be used to clean gravel. These are ideal for smaller tanks.

, The bucket must be beneath the water level. It will catch the old water.

, Slowly lower the entire siphon into the tank so that all of the air gets out of the tube. Cover the end of the tube with your thumb and take it out of the tank; keep the other, open, end submerged. Place the covered end in a bucket. If you release your thumb, the water will begin to flow; if you cover the end again with your thumb, the water will stop., Some aquarium vacuums come with a rubber ball attached to the end of the siphon. Stick the end of the siphon into the aquarium and lower the end of the tube into a bucket. Plug the end of the tube with your finger, and squeeze on the priming ball. Slowly let go of the ball, but keep the end of the tube plugged. Water will begin to fill the siphon, sort of like an eyedropper or turkey baster. When you unplug the end of the tube, water will start to flow into the bucket., These types of gravel vacuums are different from all others. They do not require a bucket. Instead, they need to be hooked up to a water faucet. Simply plug the end of the Python vacuum to your water faucet and place the entire vacuum into aquarium. When you turn the faucet on, the vacuum will begin to siphon., Simply stick it straight down, as far as it will go. Your thumb should still be blocking the end of the tube, and that the end of the tube is in the bucket. Once you let go of the tube, dirty water will start flowing out.


If you have very fine-grit gravel, such as sand, don't stick the vacuum all the way down. Instead, place the mouth just over the top of the sand., With the end of the tube still in the bucket, slowly pull your thumb away from the end of the tube. This will start creating the siphoning effect. Dirty water will flow out of the end of the tube and into the bucket. The gravel will shake and rattle inside the tube.


If you are using a Phython, or a similar type, simply turn the water on the begin siphoning.

, How long this takes will depend on how dirty your aquarium is to begin with. When you recover the tube, the gravel will settle once again.


If the gravel starts to go too far up the vacuum, just cover the end of the tube and let the gravel settle. Then, uncover the tube and let the water flow again.
If you are using a Phython, or a similar type, simply turn the water off the stop siphoning.

, Try to keep it as straight as possible, so that you don't dislodge the adjacent debris.

, Push the vacuum straight down into the gravel, and slowly release the end of the tube. When the water runs clear again, cover the tube back up and carefully lift the vacuum out.


If your tank has any caves, rocks, logs, and other nooks and crannies, be sure to give those special attention. These areas tend to get the most waste.If your tank has any live plants, leave a 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) radius around the stems. Plants love organic waste. If you remove this waste, the plants won't have anything to eat., Keep vacuuming until the water level is two-thirds of the way full. By now, you will have cleaned one-fourth to one-third of the gravel. This is perfectly fine. You do not want to clean more than that at one time. Aquarium gravel hosts a lot of good, helpful bacteria that is important for the health of your tank.You can continue cleaning the gravel the next time you do a partial water change.

, You have just removed a lot of dirty water, and you will need to replace it. Fish are very sensitive to water changes, so the new water will have to be the same temperature as the old.Most tanks should have a thermometer, but if yours doesn't, you'll need to stick a clean, glass thermometer into the water.

, Make sure that the bucket never came to contact with any chemicals or cleaners. Any residue left behind can be extremely deadly for your fish. Fill the bucket with water that is the same

, Most tap water is not aquarium safe. Use any necessary water conditioners to remove chlorine and other harmful chemicals. You can buy these from an aquarium store or in the aquatics department of a pet store.

, You will be reverse siphoning the water back into the tank. The bucket must be above the water level, or the water will not siphon back properly.


Simply pouring the water back in might seem easier, but this can cause debris to rise up and cloud the water.

, If you are using a gravel vacuum with a plastic siphon, see if you can pop the flexible tube off.

, Slowly let go of the tube. The water should start flowing back into the tank.

, This space is important. Fish need oxygen, and if you don't leave that space, the water won't get enough oxygen for your fish., Once your aquarium is all set up again, plug the heater back in, and restart the filter and pump. Take note of when you cleaned your tank, and make a note on your calendar for the next cleaning date.

, This is the only time you should be cleaning gravel. Once your gravel is in the tank, you should only vacuum it. Gravel hosts a lot of good, helpful bacteria that are beneficial for your aquarium. Rinsing your gravel will get rid of that bacteria.

, Store-bought gravel must be cleaned. It often contains dust and dirt that can be harmful for your fish. If you picked your gravel up from elsewhere, you will want to clean it as well., The smaller your gravel is, the tighter weave you will need. Make sure that you are not using this colander or strainer for any other purpose. Also, make sure that the colander/strainer never came into contact with soap or other detergents. If you are cleaning sand, consider using a piece of cotton instead.

, If you have a lot of gravel to clean, you may need to work in smaller batches. The gravel should enough room in the colander/strainer to move around without spilling over the edges.

, Use a warm or hot water setting. This will help kill any bacteria. Do 'not add any soap, detergent, or bleach. Doing so can kill your fish., Shake and jiggle the colander/strainer. Stick your hand into the gravel, and sift it about. Keep doing this until the water runs clear., Turn off the water and give the colander/strainer a final shake to get rid of any excess water. Spread the gravel along the bottom of your tank. If you still have more gravel to add, repeat the whole cleaning process for each batch.

Avoid overfeeding.",How to Do a Water Change in a Freshwater Aquarium," Get out a clean bucket and fill it with water directly from the faucet. Follow the instructions on your water conditioner bottle and pre-treat the water prior to cleaning. The conditioner will make the water safe for your fish by removing dangerous chemicals and metal residue.Go ahead and keep two plastic buckets, specifically for your aquarium use. You may even want to write “fish” on the side.Some people prefer to refill their tank using water directly from the tap. This may be more convenient; however, you do risk exposing your fish to hazardous chemicals in the water. To lessen this possibility, let the tap run for 5 minutes or so before filling the bucket.;
, Since you will be working with water around the exterior of the tank, it is best to minimize the presence of electricity. Go ahead and disconnect the tank lid and any attached lighting. Reach into the tank and unplug any exposed heating elements., Many filters don’t do well without full water coverage, so it is a good idea to disconnect your filter as you start the cleaning process. You do not need to clean or replace your filter cartridge, sponge, or other media every time that you clean the tank. Instead, look at it, see how it is holding up, and then run it through cold water or fully replace it, if needed.Replacing your filter too often can have disastrous consequences for your tank by removing the accumulated good bacteria. To counterbalance a filter change, you might want to invest in gravel, or sand, with pre-added bacterial cultures., It is also not necessary to clean your tank accessories as a part of every water change. Doing so can disrupt the good bacteria in your tank too. However, if the artificial items in your tank seem overly slimy or sludgy looking, then you’ll want to gently remove them to a bucket and allow them to soak in a plant cleaning solution.Never wash your plants and décor in soap. The chemical residue can be harmful to your fish, and it can also cause an outburst of algae in your tank.
You can also soak your plants and décor in a chlorine bleach and water mixture. Add 1-2 tablespoons of bleach per water in a bucket., Every time that you do a water change take a quick look at your tank and see if it needs a scrub. Look for green or brown film on the sides of the tank. While the tank is still full, use an algae sponge or scraper to rub the tank’s side and remove the residue., This is the most efficient, and often preferred, way of performing a partial water change, especially in larger tanks. Attach the device directly to your faucet and then insert one of the connected hoses and siphon attachments into your tank. The device will automatically suck out water for you, until you switch it off. Then, flip the switch again and insert the faucet hose to refill the tank.This method is especially useful for those people unable to haul multiple buckets of water around in order to perform regular cleanings. It also minimizes the potential to create a watery mess.
Just make sure that the new water that you are adding is close to the original temperature of the tank. Check this before starting the automatic suctioning process., If you don’t have an all-in-one system, then you will need to perform the water switch by hand. Start by placing the tube end of your siphon into a bucket. Then, place the siphon tip into the tank’s substrate, usually gravel or sand. Repeatedly insert the siphon deep into the sand at an angle, drawing out both debris and tank water.Don’t feel as if you have to perfectly clean all of the gravel during each change. In fact, it is better if you section off your tank and clean certain areas of the gravel each time. This lessens the impact of the change for your fish.

, As you move your siphon around, you will notice that your bucket begins to fill with dirty gravel and murky tank water, this is perfectly normal and what you want. However, don’t take it too far. Use your siphon to remove a maximum of 30% of the tank’s water. Going beyond this can irreparably alter your tank’s chemistry.For example, if you have a 10 gallon tank, it is a good idea to use a 3 gallon bucket for water changes. Then, when the bucket is full, you know that you’ve removed the right amount of water., Now that your tank is less full, spend a bit of time checking out the status of your tank from an inside view. If you don’t fully remove your decorations, then perhaps pick them up and look them over for any damage. Check to make sure that all of your heating and filtration systems seem okay in structure., If you have a tank-side thermometer, make a quick note of the temperature of the water post-drain. Otherwise, it is a good idea to dip a thermometer into the water to get a reading. Then, test the temperature of the clean, treated water that you will add to the tank in a bit. Make sure that the two temperatures match. If not, you may need to give it a some more time before completing the change.Water temperature fluctuations can make fish more susceptible to illness. Make sure to take the tank’s temperature again after you’ve added in the fresh water.

, At this point, you will want to move the pretreated water from the bucket into the tank. You can do this by pouring the water into a pitcher and then emptying the pitcher into the tank. Or, you can hold the bucket with both hands and empty it directly into the tank.Whichever method you choose, just make sure that the water doesn’t rush in super-fast and disturb the gravel and your decorations. Some people like to use their hand, or a plate, to lessen the direct flow of the water into the tank.

, If you’ve taken out any of your artificial decorations, you can add them back in either immediately before, or directly after, refilling the tank. You can use this as an opportunity to move items around, or to leave items out entirely for a new look.

, All of the functioning systems that you unplugged at the start of this process now need to be hooked up again. Make sure your hands are dry and carefully reinstall and restart all of these items. Some types of filers, such as the hang-on ones, will need 1-2 cups of water directly fed into the system before they will start working., Create a designated area where you keep all of your tank cleaning supplies. You will want to allow your buckets, scrubbers, and siphon to air dry before storing. Keeping up with regular storage procedures may keep you from having to buy replacements., It is a good idea to complete a weekly, or bi-weekly, water change on a consistent basis. Again, you will not remove all of the water each time, only 25-30%. If you see the need, you can also do a deep cleaning of your tank on a monthly basis.You must balance out a desire to keep your tank clean with the health of your fish. Too frequent, or too few, cleanings can adversely impact their health.

, Performing partial changes is also an excellent way to re-establish stability in your tank after an unusual event, such as a re-scaping or a chemical overdose. Don’t be afraid to do an unscheduled water change in these cases as the reward is worth it., If you run your aquarium lights all day and every day, you will likely see a quick, aggressive accumulation of algae and debris. This is because the light is helping the algae to feed off of your tank. Instead, try keeping your lights on for 10-14 hours for tanks with live plants or 6-10 hours otherwise., Much of the debris that you siphon out of the gravel will be leftover food. To avoid this issue, resist the desire to overfeed and instead stick with a once or twice daily schedule. And, adjust your feeding practices depending on how well your fish eat what is offered."
"
Shake it.,
Scrub it.,
Pick at it.,
Rub it with sandpaper.,
Kill off any bugs.",How to Clean Driftwood1," If you picked up your driftwood from a natural location, such as a lake, you might see particles of dirt sticking to the wood’s surface. Grab the piece by the end and give it a good shake. Perhaps tap it gently on the ground a few times to loosen any additional grains.


This also helps to remove any pests, like ants, from the wood.;
, If you are working with ‘outside’ wood then you may need to get more serious about removing the grime. Grab a sturdy brush and scrub the wood. Try to go over as much of the surface area as you can. You may want to repeat the scrubbing process after the soaking the wood as well.If you plan to use the driftwood for a craft or furniture project, you may want to carefully consider your choice of brush. A soft-bristle brush will not scratch the wood whereas a wire brush will clean more effectively but can also leave scrub marks behind. It is generally a good idea to scrub with the grain.
A wire brush is a good option if you need to remove bark., Driftwood often contains small nooks that are hard to fully clean. Use a screwdriver or knife to dig into these areas. Carefully apply pressure so that you don’t splinter the wood.If you want a gentler method, push into crevices using the edge of a slightly damp toothbrush. This is especially effective at removing sand.You can also use an air compressor to shoot concentrated bursts of air into deeper holes. This is less damaging then picking and often equally effective.

, Removing the outer layer of the wood is one way to get it clean. Use a garnet sandpaper with a light grit. This type of sandpaper works well with handcrafted projects and will not overly scratch the wood. If you want to dig deeper into the wood (perhaps in a rotten area), upgrade to a higher grit.


If you are unsure about what your driftwood project requires, go to your local home improvement store to feel your various sandpaper options firsthand.

, No one wants driftwood that is infested by insects. Shaking it off will remove some pests, but to get extra reassurance seal your driftwood in a plastic bag and leave it for a few days. Check back for evidence of dead bugs.


A more aggressive way to kill off insects is to spray an insecticide into the bag before sealing it. Be warned that the chemical residue from this method could prove potentially fatal to fish if the wood is intended for an aquarium. This is best used in crafting or woodworking situations."
"
Assemble the cleaning gear before you start.,
Remove any decorations or fake plants that are in the tank.,
Use hot water.,
Dump the hot cleaning water.

,
Use the fish-safe cleaner.,
Replace the filter sponge or entire filter or any components similar to these.,
Dry with disposable paper towels, if you do not have fish or water to put in.,
Carefully add the fish slowly to avoid shock or stressing them.",How to Sanitize a Fish Tank," Depending on what the need for sanitizing is, you want to get the proper materials ready. This includes very hot water, a fish-safe cleaning product, gloves if necessary, and something to scrub with. Be sure everything is ready so you do not have to waste time looking for something. Make sure if you have any fish that lived in the tank, they are moved to an acceptable holding place, if any, while carrying out the sanitizing.;
, You can sanitize those if they are very important, but it's best to throw them away and get new ones. Sanitizing is about completely cleaning and killing all bacteria. Since bacteria can live in sponges, fake plants and decorations, adding them back in will simply re-contaminate.

, Since very hot water kills bacteria and other contaminates, you can use this to your advantage. Start by filling the tank with very hot water. Scrub if you wish.


Only use hot water for acrylic or glass tanks and bowls. Do not use with plastic bowls or the plastic will melt and it may release chemical constituents, such as BPA.,, Look for cleaning products that say ""kills 99.9% of bacteria"", but make sure it says that it is animal/fish safe or non-toxic. Otherwise, it will kill the fish once you put them back in or cause serious illnesses. Use this cleaner and get all of the inside treated, and scrub if necessary. Once finished, rinse very well.


Wear gloves if you don't wish to get cleaner or contaminants on your hands.

, This whole procedure is basically completely starting over with the tank.

, If you do, add clean, new sand/rocks, plants, and decorations. Once finished, add water and any pH balancing chemicals or modify the environment depending on what your fish's needs are.

, You're finished!


Make sure to clean the tank regularly if fish are kept.

"
Wipe it off.,
Use a scraper.,
Try an aquarium magnet.,
Clean the outside.",How to Clean Aquarium Glass1," If you just have some mild algae buildup on the inside of your glass, it's pretty easy to wipe it off with a sponge. Be sure to use a clean sponge that will not introduce any chemicals or detergents into your aquarium. It's perfectly fine to do this while your fish are in the tank as long as you don't remove much of the water.You can use a sponge with an abrasive side if you need a little extra scrubbing power.
If you don't want to put your arm in the tank, you can find a scrubber with a long handle at your local aquarium store.;
, If you just need to remove some tougher algae from the inside of your aquarium glass, it's easy to do with a scraper. Aquarium stores sell a special tool with a a scraper on one end and a brush on the other that is designed specially for this task.Let the algae fall to the bottom of the tank as you are scraping and scrubbing. You can clean it up with an aquarium vacuum when you are finished.
If the scraper is not working well enough, you can use a razor blade to scrape off the algae. Hold it at a 45 degree angle against the glass and scrape very carefully so as not to cut yourself.
Do not empty the tank to do this. Removing more than 25% of the water from your aquarium can destroy the beneficial bacteria colonies that live there, which can cause your fish to die.

, If you don't want to stick your arm in the tank to clean the glass, there is another option. You can buy an aquarium magnet at your local pet or aquarium store, which will make this task much easier. The part of the magnet with the scrubbing pad goes on the inside of the glass, and the part with the handle goes on the outside. As you move the outside part around, the inside part will glide along the inside of your tank, cleaning the glass.Be very careful not to bring your magnet within two inches of the sand or gravel at the bottom of the tank. If you get any abrasive materials stuck under the pad, you run the risk of scratching your glass.
Be sure to rinse the cleaning pad after each use, and never leave the magnet in the tank when you are not using it. This will help prevent any sand from getting under the pad.
Consider placing a piece of felt under the exterior part of the magnet to protect the glass.
Aquarium magnets are available in a variety of sizes. The size of the magnet you choose will depend on the size of your tank. Although any size will work, it may be tedious to clean a very large tank with a very small magnet.
The magnets are also available in different strengths. Use a stronger magnet for glass than for acrylic. (Be very careful not to get your fingers caught between them if you choose a strong magnet!)
Some of these magnets float so you don't have to worry about fishing them out of the tank if they become dislodged. Some also have razor blade attachments for stubborn algae.

, It's just as important to keep the outside of your aquarium glass clean as the inside, and this task is considerably easier. Simply use a lint-free cloth or soft piece of paper (coffee filters and newspaper both work well) and gently scrub the outside of your tank with warm water.Using chemical cleaners is not advised because it is possible that small particles could become airborne and contaminate the inside of your tank.
If you must use a chemical cleaner, spray it onto your cloth well away from the aquarium, instead of spraying it onto the glass."
"
Power or pressure wash it.,
Submerge the wood in distilled water.,
Soak it in a bleach solution.,
Soak it in soda water.",How to Clean Driftwood2," Hold your wood underneath a steady stream of water until you feel as if it is clean. Monitor this process carefully as too strong of a water stream can start to strip away the wood. You can also break off finer wood details if you are not careful. Allow the wood to dry outside when finished.

, ‘Curing’ driftwood is the most popular cleansing method amongst aquarium users. Place the wood inside a large container. Slowly pour distilled water into the container until the wood is completely covered. Soak for one to two weeks. Remove the wood and allow it to dry in a cool location.You will notice the water darkening over time. This is normal. It is the result of tannins being released. Leaching all tannins from your wood will keep your aquarium water clear. For maximum effectiveness, replace the soaking water if it takes on a ‘tea-color.’
When the distilled water appears clear and is no longer noticeably discolored, it is time to remove the driftwood.This is also a good, chemical-free way of diminishing the buoyancy of your driftwood. Ideally, you want your wood to sit on the bottom of an aquarium without floating to the top., Get a large container, mix bleach and distilled water together, and place your driftwood under the water. Use 2 teaspoons of bleach per gallon of distilled water. Soaking in a bleach solution will help to kill off any spores or bacteria that are lingering on the wood. Keep the driftwood submerged for a minimum of 15 minutes.If you plan to use your driftwood in an aquarium, it is best if you follow-up a bleach soak with a straight-distilled water soak. For the safety of your fish, all traces of bleach need to be out of the wood.

, Woodworking artisans often prefer to use a soda bath to clean their driftwood. Buy a cleansing soda, such as Arm & Hammer Super Washing Soda. Get a large container and mix hot water and the soda together. Keep adding soda until it stops dissolving into the water easily. Then, lower your driftwood into the mixture. Soak for 48 hours minimum.If your driftwood keeps rising to the surface when soaking, you may need to place a rock or other heavy object on it to hold it down and keep it submerged.

"
"
Boil it.,
Bake the wood in the oven.,
Apply a sealant.",How to Clean Driftwood3," This is one of the quicker ways to sterilize driftwood found in nature. Place the driftwood in a pot filled with boiling water. Keep the driftwood boiling for 1-2 hours. You may need to refill the water as it boils away. When the time is up, drain the water out, replace it, and repeat the process.Many aquarists like this method as it is virtually guaranteed to kill any fungal spores found on the driftwood., Get out a cookie sheet and cover it with foil. Place your driftwood pieces on the foil, not overlapping. Bake the wood at 200 degrees for 2-4 hours. You will want to closely monitor this process to ensure that the wood does not start to singe or burn. When finished, set the wood aside and allow it to cool., If you don’t want to bother with extensive cleaning methods and if you plan to use your wood for a project, you might consider simply applying a varnish or coating to the wood as is. Any grains present on the wood will lead to an uneven finish, but the coating itself will sanitize the wood to some extent.

"
Introduce algae eating species.,
Try plants.,
Get an automatic cleaner.",How to Clean Aquarium Glass2," If you want to get rid of algae without having to do any of the hard work yourself, consider introducing species of fish, snails, and crustaceans that eat algae. The right species for you will depend on whether you have a freshwater or saltwater aquarium, the size of your tank, and the other species that you already have, so be sure to research them before you bring them home. You don't want to end up with a fish that is too large for your tank or is aggressive with your other fish. Popular algae-eaters include:Bristlenose plecostomus
Amano shrimp
Siamese algae eaters
Twig catfish
Otocinclus
Rosy barbs
Flag fish
Ramshorn snailsNerite snailsMalaysian trumpet snails, Having plants in your aquarium can help prevent algae build up because they consume the same light and nutrients that algae does. The less of these resources there are available for algae, the less algae you will have.Plants also add beauty to your aquarium and they give your fish a place to hide, so they are beneficial in many ways.When choosing plants for your aquarium, be sure to consider what conditions they thrive in. For example, some plants need more light than others and different plants flourish at different temperatures., If fish, snails, and plants just aren't doing a good enough job of eliminating algae for you, you can get an automatic aquarium glass cleaner to do the job for you. Just place the cleaner on the inside of your glass, turn it on, and walk away.This is a pricey option, at over $200. Automatic aquarium glass cleaners are available at aquarium stores and online.
The automatic cleaner comes with a rechargeable battery and a replaceable scrubbing pad.
The automatic cleaner cannot turn corners, so you will need to reposition it if you need it to clean more than one side of the tank.

"
"
Eliminate excess nutrients.,
Change the water.,
Get a self-cleaning tank.",How to Clean Aquarium Glass3," Algae flourishes when there is too much phosphate and nitrogen in your tank. There are many different sources of these nutrients, so always be very cautious about what you are adding to your tank.If you use tap water to replenish your tank, purify it with a reverse osmosis/deionizing unit to remove any unwanted nutrients. You can purchase units that attach directly to your faucet, providing purified water from your tap. If you choose to use a unit like this, be sure to change the filters as often as the manufacturer recommends.If you purchase a saltwater mix, make sure to read the packaging carefully and only choose products that are nitrogen- and phosphate-free.
Too much food can also be a source of nutrients for algae. To avoid this, make sure to only provide as much food as your fish can eat in a few minutes.Too many fish in your tank can also cause increased levels of phosphate and nitrogen. If this seems to be a problem for you, consider moving some of your fish to another tank.Algae also needs light to grow, so be careful not to leave the aquarium lights on more than necessary. About 10-12 hours per day is plenty., If you have persistent algae problems in your fish tank, and reducing the amount of nutrients has not yet solved the problem, you may need to change some of the water. It is usually a bad idea to get rid of all of the water in your tank and start over. By doing this, you will be killing off all of the beneficial bacteria that your fish need to survive. Instead, replace 10-30% of the old water.You can purchase an aquarium siphon to easily remove the old water from your tank.If you do this once a month, you will soon notice a significant difference in the amount of algae in your tank.
Vacuuming the substrate and cleaning off any decorations you have in your tank may also help. You can purchase special aquarium vacuums that are designed for this purpose.

, If you have a small freshwater tank and you want less maintenance, consider investing in a new tank that cleans itself. There are two different types of self-cleaning tanks available, and both will significantly reduce the amount of time you spend cleaning, so they may be worth the investment.Some self-cleaning tanks use a gentle pump to remove dirty water. All you need to do is turn the pump on and place a cup under the pump to catch the dirty water. Then add clean water to replenish your tank. The pump is not strong enough to bother the fish, so you can leave them in the tank.
Other self-cleaning tanks incorporate small gardens on top to naturally clean the tank. This is done automatically, so there's nothing you need to do.

"
Make sure you have a container or cup filled with some of the current aquarium water close to the aquarium.,
Have your aquarium fish net at hand.,
If the aquarium has a lid, take it off.

,
Stick the net in the water not too close to the fish if possible.

,
Follow the fish around with the net and try to corner it on the glass edge.,
Once the fish has been caught, carefully place it in the container.

,
Clean the aquarium, then put the fish back in the cleaned tank carefully.",How to Remove Fish from an Aquarium to Clean," You will put the fish that is caught inside this container. Make sure that you use the aquarium water or the fish may die from such sudden temperature changes as well as that there is room for the fish(es) to move.

Make sure the container is not cramming the fish or bending fins or body parts.



 

;
, You will be catching one fish at a time. Make sure that the net is not too small but not super big for the fish.

,,,

Don't threaten it too much or it could get stressed out. You can prevent some stress by slowly moving the net and not making super-sudden moves.







,, Try to avoid touching the fish itself with your hands.

,
Use an aquarium vacuum/siphon to suck out a maximum of 25% of the tank water.,
Rinse decorative items (plants, rocks, etc.),
Scrub the tank with a new sponge, towel, or other type of cleaning cloth (be sure that whatever you use is free of any soap or cleaning fluids (make sure no residuals by rubbing and rinsing thoroughly).",How to Clean a Five Gallon Fish Tank," Add dechlorinator according to the package instructions. You can buy dechlorinator at any pet store. Testing kits for other water in the tank, if at all possible. Used correctly, the aquarium siphon will not harm them. Do not remove the fish from the aquarium, it will stress them and they will die.;
, Some people leave this alone, as it is preferable to green water and provides food for many fish, but it's best to remove at least some of the algae. Removing plankton from green water requires an old or expensive filter.

, It houses all the good bacteria that is the heart of the aquarium, and removing it all will kill your fish. Only replace it when it is falling apart, and when you do so, keep the old cartridge in the tank until the new one has grown good bacteria. .

,, If possible, though, keep up with water changes and change only 15% of the water per week. This rate can climb as high as one third per day in persistent, threatening turbidity. Push the end of the vacuum down into the gravel and move it around. Aim for any visible debris. Generally, the vacuum will take up the debris and the gravel will fall back to the bottom.

Without massive, frequent water changes, the tank can destabilize and put your fish at risk. Thus, it is important to schedule time to do your fish tank water changes and cleaning.Every other week, perform deep cleanings in which you remove decorations and scrub the interior.


Observe your fish daily to see whether they look healthy and are behaving normally. Do they have good color, clean scales, unclamped fins? Or are they slimy and ragged? Remove any dead fish. If your fish look sluggish, stressed, or they are gulping for air, do a water change.It is not beneficial to perform deep cleanings too often, as you will remove essential bacteria.;
, Make a checklist to ensure that you have all the necessary supplies. Having your supplies on hand will speed up the process. Most supplies are available at pet or home goods stores. Use this list to help you.


2 fish nets
Temporary fish tank or container

, Place tarps or towels on the floor to catch any spilled water. Keep the tank in place. Do not move your tank or tip it into the sink. Juggling your fish puts them under stress and stirs debris in the tank. , Wear a short-sleeved shirt or tank top. You might consider wearing a bathing suit. Aprons also can protect your clothing. Wearing water-resistant shoes like water shoes or flip flops is also a good idea.

, If applicable, unplug the aquarium’s aerator, filter, and heater. Leave hood lights plugged in. Place the hood behind the tank to illuminate the tank., It is important to clean the glass before removing any water. Use an aquarium sponge or clean soap-free cloth to remove algae and grime. Some fish owners leave algae, as it is preferable to green water and provides food for many fish. Still, it is best to remove some algae., By using the current tank water, you will cause less environmental stress on the fish.Make sure your temporary container is clean and has no soapy residue. If you are unsure of its cleanliness status, clean it with an aquarium-safe glass cleaner or a vinegar-based solution.

, Be gentle and mindful. You may want to use two nets. Use one net to herd the fish into the other net. Put your fish in the temporary container with the original tank water. Never put them in tap water. Do not allow the fish to jump from the temporary tank. Put a cover on the tank., While you do not need to remove decorative items for every water change, remove them for cleanings. Put them on a towel, and rinse them with clean, room temperature water. You may use an algae pad or new toothbrush as well. Do not use detergent or soap to wash them. The fish will die from the toxicity of soap. If algae overwhelms your decorations, consider changing your feeding or maintenance routines., Place the bucket for catching the old water below the level of the fish tank. If possible, set the bucket on the floor or on a chair. Stability is important as is close proximity to the tank. It is best to buy a new bucket to use only for cleaning your fish tank. Residue from soaps or detergents can harm your fish.

, Remove fifty percent of the water at a time.An appropriate siphon is a small 3/8"" hose that is four to five feet long.Slowly lower the complete siphon into the aquarium. Ensure that all the air is out of the tube. Plug one end of the tube with your finger and lift that end from the tank. Keep the other end in the water. Lower the removed end towards the bucket while keeping your finger in place. When you remove your finger, the water should flow into the bucket.Slowly transfer the old water into the bucket.


You can purchase a plastic tank siphon at pet shops. You also can purchase a small hand pump to put on the siphon to assist with the water transfer.Your fish are used to their old water. Removing all of it can be a shock to their organs. When you mix new water with the old water, your fish will be healthier., While you siphon water into the bucket, vacuum the gravel with the water siphon to remove fish waste and leftover food. Aquarium gravel vacuums are rigid, plastic tubes, two inches in diameter that attach to the siphon.Gravel vacuums use the momentum of the water flowing through the siphon to loosen debris and remove solid waste from your tank.It is crucial for a small tank to have good beneficial bacteria. Using gravel helps bacteria grow., Wipe down the outside of the tank. Use a vinegar-based solution or buy an aquarium-safe cleaner. Dry the exterior with a clean towel. Consider using an unbleached organic paper towel.

, After you finish cleaning your tank, return the decorations. Add gravel if necessary. Also, add any new decorations at this time.

, Prior to filling your tank with new water, treat tap water with a water conditioner. Try to find a conditioner that neutralizes chlorine, chloramine, ammonia, and other chemicals.Dechlorinators are essential.Be sure to condition the water in a clean bucket before adding it to the tank., Use a thermometer to verify the temperature of the new water matches the temperature of the old water. Having a consistent temperature for your fish is important for their health.Use your siphon to put the new water into the tank. Place your bucket at a height higher than the tank and slowly introduce the new water. Do not fill the aquarium too high. There needs to be space between the water’s surface and the aquarium cover because your fish rely on oxygen exchange at the water’s surface to breathe., Place them in a cup. Float the cup within the tank before releasing them. This process ensures the fish can adjust to the tank’s water temperature and not go into shock when released. Release your fish into the tank.


An alternative is to place the fish into small plastic airtight bags half filled with old tank water upon removing them from the tank. When you are ready to reintroduce the fish, float the bags in the tank for fifteen to twenty minutes. This will ensure that the water temperature is the same in both the bag and the tank. After this time, open the bags.

Remove the plants and decorations.,
Siphon out a portion of the water.,
Prepare replacement water.",How to Clean a Fish Tank With Sand1," Not all sands are the same. If you are using standard play sand then you can rake and siphon it without too many worries regarding tank pollution. If, however, you have a specialty planting sand you’ll need to be very careful when raking as it can release ammonia when disturbed. Read the instructions and warnings carefully on the package to find out if any special handling is necessary.You can also visit your local aquarium store and talk with an expert who will advise you regarding your sand options. Some options, such as coral sand, are quite beautiful but can be dangerous to particular species of fish.;
, If they come with a switch, turn it to the off position or simply unplug all of these devices. Your fish will be fine in the short period it will take you to complete a water change and for safety reasons it is important to not have electricity running into the tank as you handle the water.You can also take this as an opportunity to rinse out your filter pad or cartridge with cold water. You will want to do this once every two to four weeks., Dip your hand into the tank water and gently remove all decorations that you would like to clean. Wash these items in warm water scrubbing gently with your hands or a soft brush to remove all algae and debris. Place the clean decorations on a lint-free rag or into a clean bucket.There is no need to remove live plants for cleaning. It can possibly damage their roots.Cleaning decorations is a bit controversial and some argue that it is better to leave everything in the tank to preserve healthy bacteria., Place your siphon into the water and begin to drain the water directly into your sink or a bucket. You need to remove between 10-25% of the water depending on the dirtiness of the tank.You will want to complete this partial water change and cleaning process every one to two weeks.This dirty water does not need to be preserved and you can dispose of it immediately.

, Fill a clean bucket with tap water. Add drops of a water conditioner a wait a few minutes for it take full effect. The water conditioner will remove impurities and neutralize the chlorine in tap water making it safe for fish.Carefully read the instructions on your water conditioner bottle. The number of drops used varies as does the amount of time the water needs to sit."

Also, Make sure that if your fish are pretty picky eaters, you put some water cleaner in with siphoning the water. Siphon half the tank one week, then do the other tank 2-3 weeks later. This will help your fish adjust to a cleaner climate.;
, Run it along the glass, scrubbing a little as necessary, to remove algae that is sticking to the aquarium. If you come across a particularly difficult patch of residue, use a razor blade or plastic blade to scrape it off the glass.


You might want to wear rubber gloves to complete this job. Make sure they haven't been treated with any chemicals.
Do not just use the sponge or scrubber from your kitchen sink or anything that could have the residue of detergent or cleaning chemicals. A clean, tank-only algae pad will prevent harsh chemicals and detergents from getting into your tank.
This step can also be done after you take out 10-20% of the water.

, If you clean your tank on a regular schedule and if your fish are healthy, changing 10-20% of the water once a week should be plenty. If you have a sick fish, you'll want to change more of the water - at least 25% to 50%.

, Start the siphon and direct the old water into a pail, preferably a five-gallon bucket (or larger if necessary). It's best to buy a new bucket and use it only for cleaning your fish tank; residue from soaps or detergents can be harmful to your fish. This means no repurposing the laundry room bucket or the bucket that used to hold your dishwashing cleaning agents.


Aquarium siphons can be purchased that hook up to a sink. If you have one of these, read over the instructions on how they work. This type of siphon also prevents water spilling from the bucket. You can also choose the suction of the water and the temperature when filling the tank using the taps.

, Push the gravel vacuum through the gravel. Fish waste, excess food, and other debris will be sucked into the the vacuum. If you have very small, weak, or delicate fish, you can put a never-worn stocking over the end of the syphon (but be sure the mesh is large enough to get the debris).


If you have sand substrate, do not use the vacuum like a shovel. Use just the hose part of the siphon, not the plastic tube, holding it under an inch from the surface to suck up waste without disturbing your sand. You can use your fingers to run through the sand (provided there are no buried animals to disturb)to help gunk float up that might have gotten trapped under shifting sand.

, Tank decorations need cleaning, too! Excess algae is caused by excess nutrients in the water. You can wipe the decorations off with an algae pad or a never-used soft-bristled toothbrush in the tank water you siphoned out. Avoid the use of soap; it could harm your fishy friend!


If you're having difficulty cleaning the decorations, remove them from the tank and soak the items in a 10% bleach solution for 15 minutes. Then pour boiling water over them and let them air dry before replacing them in the tank. Be very careful to remove all bleach, as to not kill your fish.
If your decorations are covered in algae, you may want to feed your fish less or change the water more frequently.
Having a pleco in larger tanks can prevent algae from growing excessively.

, Replace the water you took out with fresh, treated water at the temperature of the aquarium. A thermometer is the way to verify the temperature. Staying inside the dictated temperature parameters is crucial for the health of your fish.Remember, lukewarm is too hot for most fish.


If you use tap or faucet water, conditioning the water to remove heavy metals and other toxins that your fish can't process is a must. The easiest thing to do is plan ahead; an old milk container works great. Fill it up the day before and leave it uncovered; one day will allow the chlorine to evaporate and the water to become room temperature, the same as your tank. If you are impulsive, a drop of Decleor will do the trick. Just make sure the temperature is the same. A significant change in temperature will kill your fish.
If the nitrates are astronomically high, you can do a special water change of 50% to 75% with distilled water (not normally recommended because the water is so purified, there are no trace nutritional elements for the fish to soak up). You can also use bottled spring water for water changes (with no conditioner) because this water has none of the bad and all of the good elements.

, Many fish (including Mollies, guppies and platies) live longer and healthier lives. Fresh water aquarium salt also helps to prevent diseases such as ich (Ichthyophthirius multifiliis).

, Wait a few hours for any cloudiness that remains to dissipate, leaving the water sparkling clear. Although there are water clearing agents on the market, try not to use them. If the water remains cloudy, it's because of an underlying problem and the agent will only mask (not solve) the issue. Don't forget that your fish need some space between the water and the top of the tank, so that they have enough oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange to breathe and so that they can extend their top fin comfortably.

, Wipe down the outside, including glass, hood, light and tank top. The ammonia fumes from standard cleaners can hurt your fish, so only use solutions that are designated as aquarium-safe. If you'd prefer to make your own cleaner, you can use a vinegar-based solution.

, The carbon inside of the filter cartridge can become detrimental to your fishes' health if left unchanged. Not much beneficial bacteria lives inside the filter, most is in the gravel, so changing it will not affect the biological filtration in any way. The cartridge can be rinsed off weekly when water changes are performed if it appears to be excessively dirty, but you don't want to lose whatever bacteria does happen to set in in the filter. Rinsing the filter cartridge does not substitute changing it, so it still has to be changed monthly.

Wipe the bowl with vinegar and a cloth.,
Rinse and dry the bowl thoroughly.,
Put everything back into the bowl and top it off with bottled water.",How to Clean a Fish Bowl," In order to determine how much clean water you’ll need to prepare, you first need to gently pour the bowl's current water and the fish into a clean, soap-free bucket or container. Then, mark the water level on the outside of the bucket., When you clean your fish bowl, you’ll need to replace 40-50% of the total volume of water that it holds. After you’ve marked the initial water level, use a clean cup to start putting the water back into your bowl. Once you’ve removed about half of the water, mark the new water level on the outside of the bucket and transfer the fish back into the bowl with a net.

, Once your fish is safely back in its bowl, rinse out the container you were just using. Don’t use soap to clean out the container, because this will be harmful to your fish. Fill the container back up to the halfway mark you made with fresh water., At this point, read and follow the directions on the label of your water treatment kit. Add the appropriate number of drops to the water that’s in the container. You can find water treatment for fish bowl water at any major pet store. The treatment will eliminate chlorine, chloramines and other substances that are toxic to fish.


This is a necessary step in ensuring that the water will have the proper balance of chemicals to keep your fish healthy., Cover the container with a lid to prevent airborne contaminants from making their way into the water. Let the container sit overnight so that the water can ""age"" and reach room temperature., Use a net to carefully remove your fish and any live plants from the fish bowl. One by one, transport your fish and plants to the container of treated water. Pour about half of the old water into the container of treated water with the fish and plants., Remove any rocks or decorations from the fishbowl, put them in a colander, and take them to a sink. Hold the colander directly under the faucet and shake it lightly from side to side as the running water filters out dirt and waste. Do this until the water underneath the colander runs clear., Add a half teaspoon (2.5 ml) of hydrogen peroxide to a quart of water (0.95 liters). Soak the rocks and decorations in this solution during the time you spend cleaning the fish bowl. Afterwards, rinse the items well with clean water.


Hydrogen peroxide is safe for your fish to be exposed to in small amounts because after 24 hours, it decomposes into hydrogen and oxygen., While your fish is in the container and the rocks and decorations are soaking in hydrogen peroxide, clean out the bowl. Use a wet/dry shop vac to suck up any remaining dirt, waste, and moisture that didn’t fall out naturally when you emptied the bowl.


Cover the nozzle with three layers of panty hose and secure it with a rubber band if you ever need to clean the bowl quickly and you don’t have time to remove the rocks, decorations, and water first., Dip a clean cloth or paper towel in vinegar and scrub the fish bowl clean. Then, dip another clean cloth or paper towel in water and wipe all surfaces of the bowl again., Place the bowl under the sink faucet and rinse the inside and outside well. With a cloth that’s clean and dry, wipe the bowl dry to remove spots and ensure your fish’s safety., After the bowl is clean, place the rocks and decorations back in and carefully pour the container of treated water back into the bowl. Stop about halfway through and use a net to transport the fish and live plants. Fill the fish bowl with bottled water until it reaches about 2 inches (5.08 cm) from the top."

So find a suitably sized bowl, container or bucket that will serve as a temporary holding tank.Use a bowl or container that has not been washed with soap, as the residue from many soaps can be harmful to fish.;
, You will need to age the water you will use in your holding tank to equalize the temperature and PH balance. Let the water sit overnight after filling the temporary holding container to achieve the proper temperature and to allow the levels of chlorine in the water to neutralize.If you don’t want to wait for water to age overnight, then it is wise to treat this water with a dechlorinator. These products neutralize the chlorine levels found in most city and municipal water sources.Make sure the water in this temporary holding tank is the same temperature as the water in the permanent tank. You may also wish to cover this tank with a lid to prevent the fish from jumping out.

, Don’t place the temporary holding tank in a window or under a bright light, as the heat from these sources can raise the water temperature, potentially harming your fish. Also, be sure to place your temporary holding tank in a place where children and other household pets can't bother the fish., Take your fishnet and scoop your fish out of the fish bowl and put them into the temporary holding tank of fresh water. Use a large bowl for this holding tank so that your fish have plenty of room to swim.When using a fishnet to transfer fish from one container to another, make sure the containers are close together. This will reduce the amount of time the fish is out of the water, thus reducing its stress levels.Alternatively, you can use a small, clean bowl to transfer your fish. Make sure the bowl does not have soap or soap residue on it and select a rounded bowl with smooth edges. When using this method, simply dunk the small bowl into the fish tank and allow the fish to swim into it. Be patient and don’t chase the fish around its bowl. This could stress the fish out., While you undertake the cleaning process, make sure to keep a watchful eye on your fish in their temporary tank. Look for changes in their behavior, color and activity levels. The following signs should be an indicator that the water in the temporary tank is too warm.Hyperactivity
Changes in the fish’s color
“Yawning” at the surface of the water (although some fish, like labyrinth fish, breathe this way)
If the water is too cold, your fish may exhibit the following signs:
Inactivity
Sitting on the bottom
Changes in color

, Dump out the old water from your fish bowl. Use a net, sieve or filter to keep the solid contents from falling out of the bowl and down your drain. You may also wish to dump the dirty water into a garden or potted plant. , Scrub the gravel and other decorations in your bowl with warm water and a little bit of salt. For the best results, place the gravel and decorations on a mesh sieve and scour with hot water from your sink. Once you have done this, set them aside and allow them to cool., Scrub the fish bowl with warm water and salt. Avoid soaps and cleansers that may leave chemical residue inside the tank. Then, rinse the bowl thoroughly with warm water.If there is a noticeable buildup of lime on your fish bowl, clean it with vinegar then rinse the vinegar out with warm water. , After washing and rinsing the fish bowl, allow it to sit for 20 to 30 minutes. This will give the glass of the bowl time to cool down from its exposure to the warm water used to wash and rinse it out. Allowing the bowl time to return to room temperature will help to ensure the bowl is the ideal temperature when the fish are returned. , Place the gravel and any decorations back into your clean fish bowl before putting clean water in the bowl. Make sure everything is arranged the way it was before so as not to upset the fish by changing their environment., Fill the fish bowl with room temperature water that has been treated or left out overnight to reach room temperature. If you choose to use dechlorinator, be careful not to spill it, as it could leave a chemical smell on your carpet or furniture.Again, you may wish to use a dechlorinator rather than waiting overnight for chlorine levels to neutralize. If this is the case, make sure allow the water temperature to equalize before placing the fish back in the tank.Be sure to cover the water or put it out of reach if you have pets or children. This will help you ensure the water is not contaminated while it is aging.

, Scoop your fish from the temporary holding tank using your fishnet or small bowl. Try to move the fish as quickly as possible to avoid stressing the fish. Also, take care not to drop the fish or let them fall, as they can be badly injured if this occurs. , Place your fish back into the fish bowl that has been filled with clean water. Gently lower the fish into the water using a net or a bowl. Do not just dump the fish into the bowl., Fish are most likely to experience stress and environmental or temperature related maladies during and immediately after cleaning their tank. So, keep a close eye on your fish after putting them back in their bowl to ensure they are adjusting well to their cleaned environment. "

Scrape off algae.,
Rake your fingers through the sand.,
Remove surface debris with a gravel siphon.,
Replace all decor.,
Pour fresh water into the tank.,
Re-activate your heater, filter, and lighting.",How to Clean a Fish Tank With Sand2," Use a specialty algae scrubber or a lint-free cloth to gently rub the inside of your tank. Apply consistent and light pressure while making small circles on the surface. It is okay if pieces of algae fall to the sand as they will be siphoned up shortly.Resist pushing too hard on your tank as it can cause damage or make the tank possibly tip over., Place your fingers into the sand at the bottom of your tank. Gently push the sand from the bottom to the top. Repeat throughout the tank floor until all sand has been upturned. You will see that debris and deposits have settled on the surface of the sand.It is sometimes helpful to go over the sand surface one time with the siphon prior to raking.

, Lower your siphon until it is about ½ inch above the sand’s surface. Move the siphon in a back-and-forth pattern, holding the depth level, as you pick up debris and dirt. Target any particularly large particles.You can expect for the siphon to pick up some sand particles with this method. You can then re-rinse those particles and re-introduce them to the tank or you can throw them out. It is often a good idea to add in new sand every few weeks anyway., Take your time picking up the clean decorations and putting them back into the tank. You can follow the same pattern as before or you can mix it up with a new design. Make sure each piece is anchored and move around the freshly cleaned sand as needed.

, Replace the water that you removed by adding in the treated water to your tank. You can pour directly from the bucket, although that may disturb your tank and fish. A better option might be to use a jug to add the new water in slowly.You can also deflect the water with a plate as it is added in which will lower the chance of damage even more.

, As soon as you’ve completed the water change you can plug all of your tank appliance back in. Watch to make sure that they are operating properly before leaving the tank alone.


You may want to leave your tank light off for a few hours following a water change. This can help your fish to relax following what may have been a stressful event.
Check the temperature of the replacement water with a thermometer before adding it to your tank. Both water temps should be roughly the same or you risk shocking your fish.

Keeping stirring and churning until dirt particles rise to the top. Pour this dirty water out and repeat the process. Keep going until the water is clear and your sand is ready for the tank.Use cold water to rinse your sand, but allow it to reach room temperature before adding it to your tank., Keep a small net near to your tank. Whenever you see any debris or dirt particles floating in the tank simply catch them in the net and dispose of them. This is especially important to do in the hour or so after feeding time., As you make alterations to your tank décor keep in mind that items can get trapped under the sand and release toxins into the water as they decay. When you remove live plants make sure to take the roots out as well. Gently dig them out of the sand., It is possible to replace entire sections of your sand substrate over the course of a few months. To do this you would use a gravel cleaner to pick up the dirty sand, replacing it with new, freshly-cleaned sand.Be aware that this method may keep your tank clean but it can also stress out your fish and diminish the production of good bacteria.

, Snails can help to minimize the growth of algae in your tank, leading to cleaner sand as well. They also dig into the sand and prevent stagnation. Go to your local aquarium store and learn about the different types of snails that could suit your particular tank."

Get your cleaning supplies ready.,
Clean off the algae.,
Siphon out the water.,
Clean the gravel.,
Clean the decorations.,
Check for salt creep.,
Mix a saltwater solution and add it to the tank.,
Check the temperatures every day.",How to Clean a Fish Tank2," Saltwater aquariums have special needs in addition to the basic supplies you'd use for a freshwater aquarium. Gather the following supplies:


Properly prepared water in the quantity you'll need to replace.
An algae pad for cleaning the glass inside the tank.
A large bucket (5 gallons or 10 litres, or bigger) dedicated for this purpose.
A simple siphon-type gravel vacuum (NOT a battery-operated gadget).
Filter media (cartridges, sponges, carbon packets, and so on) if you're changing the filter this time.
Aquarium-safe glass cleaner or a vinegar-based solution.
Salt mix.
pH strips.
A refractometer, hygrometer, or salinity probe.
A thermometer.
10% bleach solution in a separate container (optional)

, Use the algae pad to remove algae residue from the inside of the tank. Use a razor blade or plastic blade to scrape off built-up residue that's difficult to remove.

, For a saltwater aquarium, change 10% of the water every 2 weeks. This should be sufficient to eliminate nitrates from the water. Turn on the siphon and let the water run into a large bucket., Push the gravel vacuum through the gravel. Fish waste, excess food, and other debris will be sucked into the the vacuum. If you have very small, weak, or delicate fish, you can put a never-worn stocking over the end of the siphon (but be sure the mesh is large enough to get the debris). For sand substrate, use just the hose part of the siphon, not the plastic tube, holding it under an inch from the surface to suck up waste without disturbing your sand.

, Wipe the decorations off with an algae pad or a never-used soft-bristled toothbrush in the tank water you siphoned out. You can also remove the decorations from the tank and soak the items in a 10% bleach solution for 15 minutes. Then pour boiling water over them and let them air dry before replacing them in the tank.

, When the salt water evaporates at the top of the aquarium, it will leave behind a crusty residue known as salt creep. Clean it off with an algae sponge and add back the lost water.

, Adding water to a saltwater aquarium is a little more involved than the process for a freshwater aquarium. You need to ensure that the temperature, salinity and pH of the water are all within an acceptable range for your fish. Start this process the night before you clean your tank.


Buy distilled or reverse osmosis water. You can purchase these at the grocery store. Place the water in a clean plastic bucket, preferably used only for this purpose.
Heat the water with a specialized heater, purchased at a pet store.
Add the salt mix. One-step salt mixes are available at pet stores. Follow the instructions on how much to add based on how much water you are using. The rule of thumb is 1/2 cup of mix for every gallon of water.
Let the water aerate overnight. In the morning, check the salinity with a refractometer, hygrometer, or salinity probe. The ideal reading is between 1.021 and 1.025. Also, check the temperature with a thermometer. For saltwater fish, it should be between 73 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit (23 and 28 degrees Celsius).

, Saltwater fish live in a relatively narrow temperature range. To make sure they're healthy, you'll want to check the temperature of the aquarium on a daily basis.

Test the water again after an hour to make sure it has the right chemical balance.

,
Finished.

",How to Change the Water in a Fish Aquarium3," Use a bucket that is only for the aquarium so that you don’t get other chemicals and contaminants in the water. If the tap water is not the right temperature, you can leave it out for a few hours at room temperature.

, Always add a water conditioner (with Stress Zyme if you need some slime coat protection) to get rid of the chloramines/chlorine. Not doing so will result in damage to fish gills and a slow death!, If you are using straight tap water, you will need to put some neutralizer in it and let it set for a minute. Test it again before putting it into the tank.

, This is better than pouring it in because it won’t upset the fish or the decorations.

Walk to school on your own or with a friend.",How to Walk to School Safely1," Find one of your parents and ask them if they can walk you to school. They can help you find a good walking route. This way you can spend some time with them before you go to school and they go to work.


If you are between four and six years of age, walk to school with one of your parents or a guardian.If you are between seven and nine years of age, you may feel more independent but you should still walk to school with a guardian.If you are ten years or older, you may be able to walk to school on your own. Start by walking the route with your parents or a guardian and then ask them if you can walk the route on your own.You might ask your parents: “Can you walk me to school tomorrow morning? I want to learn the route to school so I can eventually walk to school on my own. Maybe we can walk together tomorrow?”;
, Ask your parents if you can walk to school with a neighborhood friend and their parents.If your parents are busy in the morning, it might be best to walk to school with one of your neighborhood friends and their parents. Make sure you have permission from your parents to walk to school with them.

, A walking school bus is a group of friends, neighbors and guardians walking to school together. You will be walking to school with a small or large group of people, so you can talk to your friends or neighbors while walking to school. Ask your parents if there is a walking school bus in your neighborhood that you can join.You might tell your parents: “I heard about a walking school bus that leaves at eight o'clock in the morning from the church. Can I join the walking school bus?”

, If you are ten years or older and are very familiar with your route to school, your parents might let you walk to school on your own or with a friend.Ask your parents if you can walk to school on your own.


You might say, “I have been walking the same route to school for three years. I know the route very well now. The crossing guard knows me and I always look both ways before crossing the street. Can I walk to school on my own now?”

Consider therapy if you chronically fear that someone is in your house.",How to Tell if Someone Is in Your House," If your door is ajar and you left it locked, you can be sure someone is inside. Alternately, you might notice a window which is open or smashed in, or a door handle which has been dented as if by a hammer or other heavy object. These signs indicate that someone is in your house who shouldn’t be there.If there is snow on the ground, you might be able to see strange footprints leading to or from the back or side of your home.Consider this evidence that someone is in your home.
You could also look for a strange vehicle parked in your driveway or at the edge of your yard. A vehicle parked in close proximity to your home might be a getaway vehicle.;
, There are many visual clues in your home that might indicate someone is inside. You might also see lights on inside that you didn’t leave on when you left. These visual clues constitute evidence that someone is in your house. You might also see a person or persons moving around when you look through the windows.


In some cases, a home invader gets a little too comfortable in your home and ends up passed out or asleep. Check the couch and beds to discover if someone is in your house.When you walk inside your house, look at the floor. If you see muddy footprints across your floor with a tread that does not belong to you or anyone living in your house, a stranger is in your house.Similarly, a burglar who walked in from the rain might leave wet footprints in their wake.If you see any evidence that someone is in your house, exit immediately and call the police.

, A regular pattern of movement could be the sound of footsteps padding up or down the stairs. You might also hear an irregular pattern of movement, like the creak of a door being opened or closed, or the sudden knocking or breaking sound of someone bumping into something in the dark.


Some sounds which indicate someone is in your house are more dramatic and obvious than others. For instance, the crash of a window being broken is an easy way to identify if someone might be in your house.If someone is trying to enter your house, you might hear a doorknob being turned, or a door rattling as a criminal tries to force it open.
If you hear these or similarly suspicious sounds, call the police immediately and follow their directions.
Listen carefully if you hear a strange sound. It might just be the wind, or another housemate moving about.

, If you have a home alarm system installed, you should be able to hear the sound of it playing loudly in the form of regular beeps or a siren-like sound when you approach your house. If your system includes a digital camera setup, you might be able to check the video feed online with your phone or laptop, even if you are not at home. Do so to discover whether someone is in your home.


If possible, spring for a wireless alarm system. About one quarter of all burglars reported cutting telephone or alarm system wires before entering their target home. Wireless technology will make this impossible.Many alarm systems will automatically contact the authorities for you. Some contact you instead. If your alarm system goes off, or you come home and find it has been triggered, exit the house and contact the police immediately.

, If you are outside your house and see signs of forced entry, call the authorities immediately.Police are trained to deal with home invasions and will assume the risk of checking the house for you. If you’re inside the house and within sight of an exit, go outside and remain there until the police come. If you can go to a neighbor’s house in the interim, or call a friend to wait with you in your car outside, do so.


If you’re inside the house and cannot easily leave, close and lock the door of the room you’re in and quietly call the police.
Ensure you know how to speed-dial the police before you need to do so. In the heat of the moment, it can be hard to dial even a simple number like 911.
Be sure to obtain a copy of the police report after they’ve finished conducting their walk-through; you will need this later to file an insurance claim if anything has been damaged or stolen.

, If you think you hear someone you know, like a friend or family member, call their name. If nobody replies, ask again in a more general way to let the intruder know that you know they are there. Ask in a loud, curious tone, “Is someone there? If someone is there, come out now.” This will alert the person in your house that their cover is blown. Hopefully, they will flee and avoid confrontation.


Another way to panic the intruder and get them to flee is to hit the alarm on your car. If you have your keys handy, set the car alarm off with the panic button on your key fob. This will also alert your neighbors to the fact that you’re in trouble.

, Staying quiet can help avoid a confrontation. Move quickly but quietly to a closet or hide under the bed. Rooms which are unlikely to be of interest to the thief like the bathroom are good places to hide as well. Slow your breathing and stay out of view. Whatever hiding place you choose, don't move from there until the police arrive.

, Do not antagonize them or tell them you've called the police. Do not try to stall them by telling them incorrect locations of valuables or money, as this will only anger them.

, Hopefully, the police will arrive in a timely manner, or the intruder will be scared off by your verbalizing. But if the intruder attacks you, be ready to act. In cases of home invasion, you will be overcome by a wave of adrenaline and feel suddenly “pumped up” and ready to act.


Defending yourself is not the same as preemptively attacking the individual who should not be in your house. Do not engage in combat with the home invader unless absolutely necessary.
Do not use guns, knives, or other weapons unless you are properly trained.You might accidentally hurt yourself or someone you care about., Do a walk-through of the home after the police have checked it for invaders. Check your valuables and jewelry and high-end appliances like your TVs, computers, fridge, and washer and dryer. If you have receipts and pictures of the objects which were stolen, you should include them in your insurance claim to verify its accuracy.


Check local pawn shops after the break-in if anything was missing. Thieves may try to peddle the goods they stole on local market websites like Craigslist, so check the web, too.

, If there are little things that are always left in a certain position or condition, use these things as benchmarks to measure if your house is as you left it. For instance, perhaps you always leave the lights off in certain rooms of your house. If you come home and see the lights have been turned on and nobody else lives in your house, then it is safe to conclude that someone is in your house.

, Talk to your family or housemates about a meetup spot where everyone can assemble in the event of a break-in or other emergency. For instance, you might decide to gather your family in the meadow across the street from your house. If you have children or others who are unable to ambulate easily on their own, designate someone in the house as responsible for them.Your plan should include a specific escape route out of each room. Will you exit via a door, window, or fire escape? Put these details in the plan.

, It’s an easy thing to do, but many people forget to lock their doors or consider it unnecessary. Locking your door when you go out and before you go to bed is the easiest way to deter robbers. Keep yourself and your family safe by locking your doors.If you’re worried about home security or live in a high-crime area, consider getting a security door installed with double-cylinder deadbolts. A security door is an extra layer of protection in the form of a barred steel gate that only opens with a key on both sides.

, Your essentials are those things you never leave your home without: wallet, keys, and phone. If you’re the victim of a home invasion and need to leave in a hurry or call the police, you’ll be glad you have all your things together and ready to go. Keep the essentials handy in an easy-to-reach location like a backpack or on your person.


Keep your cell phone charged at all times. At night, place your phone and your other essentials on a nightstand or on the floor beside the bed.

, Burglars rarely enter a home when someone is home for the obvious reason that they do not want to be caught. Only 28% of burglaries occurred when someone is home. A mere seven percent of burglaries ended in violence against the resident(s) of the home.Less than one in ten violent crimes are committed by strangers in the victim’s house.Statistically, therefore, you are unlikely to have a stranger in your house.

, Think about other occasions when you thought someone was in your house and, upon inspection, nobody was.This time is probably no different. Don’t let your mind run wild with the false belief that someone is in your house.


Conjure calming imagery.For instance, imagine yourself sitting serenely beside a beautiful lake or river.
Practice observing your thoughts. Stay conscious of the process by which you become fearful at the possibility of someone entering your house. When you experience these thoughts, push them away and don’t blindly give yourself over to the fear which they entail.Imagine these fearful thoughts are red balloons. In your mind’s eye, picture them floating away, one by one, into the air. Picture yourself holding only blue balloons which represent your peaceful, relaxed mind.
Listen to some relaxing music. Slow jazz or classical are great for putting the mind at ease.

, If you have pets and hear a sudden clatter or find a broken object somewhere in your house, it might well have been caused by your pet’s rambunctious behavior. Sometimes stairs creak due to the home settling. Furnaces and refrigerators turn on and off periodically. These things are normal. Consider other possibilities beyond someone being in your home when you hear a strange sound.

, Cognitive behavioral therapy is a technique in which you will, with the assistance of a trained therapist, identify anxiety-based thoughts like the notion that someone is in your house and then identify if they are logical and accurate.Your therapist will help you work through the paranoid thoughts and chronic fears you have to improve your mental health.


Your therapist might also prescribe medication to tackle underlying conditions such as anxiety, depression, and paranoia.

Listen to your instincts, and learn how to spot a dangerous man.,
Push a man away if his physical actions or verbal communications tell you he is dangerous to you.,
Act proactively when you are out at night.,
Change your dating patterns.",How to Spot a Dangerous Man1," Dangerous men look just as normal as men who are not threatening to you or others. His danger to you does not have to include physical danger -- he can be a threat financially, spiritually, emotionally, or sexually.


Control is a danger sign. If he wants control over you, mentally, economically or emotionally, this is a warning sign. Also, beware of lies being used to gain dominance.;
, Even though society has taught you to be polite and accommodating, when a man is dangerous and you are picking up on this, you can be rude as you rebuff his advances.

, If you are walking through a parking garage or down a dark street, have your keys interlaced between your fingers in a tight grip should you encounter a man you don't know. If a man is following you, look for an open business so you can seek help. If you carry mace, make sure to have the kind that does not freeze in cold climates.


Wasp Spray is recommended. It is a much better deterrent as it has a much longer and more accurate spray pattern. It can also be extremely damaging to the recipient.

, If you have been involved in past, unhealthy relationships with men who caused some form of harm to you, start learning what attracts you to these men and makes you normalize dangerous relationship patterns.

Find a safe walking route.A safe walking route has sidewalks all the way to the school.,
Learn your route.,
Find safe spots on the way to school.,
Find a walking route that is free of unsafe spaces.,
Take a water bottle with you.,
Wear appropriate clothing and shoes.",How to Walk to School Safely2," The route should also have great visibility at intersections. This means that you can easily see cars coming at the intersection. Your walking route should also be free of hazards such as major construction projects. Preferably, the route also has crossing guards at important intersections.


Choose roads with less traffic and lower speed limits.
Crossing guards help you get across the street safely.If there are no sidewalks, you should find roads with large shoulders and walk against oncoming traffic on the shoulder of the road.
If your regular route has a construction project, you should find an alternate route.

, Walk your route with a parent or guardian and ask them for tips on how to cross intersections. Once you have walked your route many times, you will be more comfortable with walking to school.

, Safe spots are restaurants, stores, libraries, police stations, and your parents’ friends’ houses.If you get scared of something or someone, you can go to one of these safe spots for help.

, You should have a walking route that avoids isolated places like empty parking lots or deserted houses., You never know when you are going to get thirsty, so remember to bring your water bottle.


Choose a water bottle that does not leak.Choose a water bottle that is free of BPA and other chemicals.Choose an insulated water bottle to keep your water at a nice temperature., Remember to wear comfortable walking shoes and colored clothing. Colorful clothing will help make you visible to oncoming traffic.


In the fall and winter, remember to wear warm clothing. You want to make sure you are warm while walking to school."

Choose a safe place to cross an intersection.,
Look both ways to check for oncoming traffic.,
Maintain awareness of the traffic around you.,
Avoid interacting with suspicious strangers.A stranger is someone you don’t know.,
Find a police officer, firefighter or a teacher.",How to Walk to School Safely3," A safe crossing has fewer cars and a clear view of traffic. Ideally, a safe crossing also has a crossing guard.Look to see if there is a crossing guard. If there is a crossing guard, they will tell you when to cross the street.

, Before you cross the street, look in both directions to make sure there are no cars coming. Once you have determined that there are no cars coming, you can cross the intersection.


If there is a crossing guard, follow their instructions on when to cross the street., While you are walking to school, you should keep your head up and know where the traffic is at all times., Strangers are neither good nor bad but they are people you do not know. You should be careful around strangers who look suspicious or dangerous and try to avoid them by walking on the other side of the street.


If a stranger approaches you and makes you feel uncomfortable, you should say “no,” and then run away from them. You should also yell loudly as you are running away. Then, find an adult and tell them what happened right away. This is called “No, Go, Yell, Tell.”If you are far from home, phone your parents right away.

, If you get lost on the way to school, find a teacher, firefighter or a police officer. Police officers and firefighters have distinctive uniforms. You should be able to recognize a teacher from your school. Make sure you know where the fire and police stations are located on your walk to school, so you can go for help.


Ask your parents to give you a cell phone with the police phone number programmed into the phone, so you can call for help if necessary.

Learn the signs of the dangerous man before you get involved with one.,
Study these specific types of men: emotional predator, parent seeker, hidden life, emotional unavailability, violent man, mentally ill, has issues with addictions, and the permanent clinger.",How to Spot a Dangerous Man2," Briefly, these hints of peril include fast-paced relationships, the man's history, multiple relationships, how he selects his girlfriends, and patterns of behavior.


Resist his pressure to move your relationship too quickly. Dangerous and pathological men usually start a new relationship with an agenda in mind. They want ""instant intimacy"" so they can begin victimizing you.
Investigate his past. Find out if he has a criminal history, mental health issues, or a history of domestic/dating violence.
Ask your boyfriend about past relationships. If he chooses to tell you about his past girlfriends, listen closely. The man who does not like being by himself develops a history of multiple relationships so he can be with someone -- anyone!
Look for consistent and enduring patterns of behavior. Dangerous men with pathological disorders behave the same way with each new woman they begin dating
Seek information about your boyfriend's former partners. If he has been with women who are also emotionally unhealthy, listen to your gut and back away.

, These types of men have a mental pathology or, if they have not been diagnosed, a therapist should examine and evaluate them.


Watch this man very closely, especially if he is quickly able to discern and meet your needs. The emotional predator rapidly divines your needs and vulnerabilities.
Listen to your radar if you begin to suspect you have met a man who wants you to take care of all his needs. He wants a parent and is willing to use you for your care-giving skills.
Check into his history. Make note of problems such as criminal behavior, undisclosed children or diseases, women you didn't know about, and dangerous habits, addictions or hobbies.
Follow your instincts if you have met a man who is committed but promises he is ""just about"" to leave a prior relationship. These men seek out women with poor boundaries.
Pay close attention if you have met the ""Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde"" type of man. His negative side comes out when he needs to get back on top in the relationship. He will hit, shame, inflict physical harm, blame, and damage property if it forces you to return to him.
Listen to your instincts if you realize you have met a man who has an addiction of some kind. His addiction does not have to be to drugs or alcohol -- instead, it can be to pornography, thrill seeking, sex, or simply being in a relationship.
Pay attention to your feelings. For example, if you are in a relationship and feel as if you are giving everything and have nothing left to give, you might be involved with a permanent clinger.

Avoid communicating with the stalker.,
Take all threats seriously.,
Make changes to your technology.",How to React if You Think Someone is Stalking You1," A stalker’s behavior makes them feel they have power over you. If you provide them with any reaction, even telling them to leave you alone, they have successfully manipulated you into getting you to respond to them. Never respond or react to them.Do not respond to any of their texts, emails, or website comments. Instead, save all of these communications for evidence.
If you see the stalker, try not to show any reaction. The stalker wants to see you react to know they have control. Do your best to present a stone-faced and calm exterior, but don’t beat yourself up if you can’t. Their behavior is not your fault.;
, If the stalker has directly or indirectly threatened to harm you, believe them. Contact law enforcement immediately and make plans to be safe.Make sure you record and report all details of the threat once you are in a safe place.
A stalker may also threaten suicide in order to manipulate you, particularly if you were previously in a relationship with them. If this happens, contact law enforcement. Do not allow yourself to be manipulated.

, If your stalker had access to your phone or computer, get new ones. The old ones may be infected with spyware or GPS tracking devices. Get a new email address and phone number.Send out an email from your new email address to your close contacts. You could say, “I’ve had to change my email address because I’m currently being harassed and stalked by my ex-husband. I ask that you please not share this address with others unless you have my permission.”
Change your passwords for all online accounts, including banking, shopping, and entertainment websites.
You may wish to keep your old email and phone/phone number active in order to collect evidence against the stalker, but have that information forwarded along to law enforcement.

Quickly walk away if a stranger approaches you.",How to Protect Yourself from a Stranger (for Kids)1," Good strangers are people you don't know but they are there to help you, such as a police officer or a doctor. However, bad strangers are people whom you don't know, who want to hurt you, do something that will make you feel uncomfortable or might take you away from your mom and dad. Bad strangers are the ones you need to stay away from.

, If they start following you, then something isn't right and you must tell a trusted adult about this.

Find a nearby pull station.,
Pull the lever on the pull station.

,
If the pull station is dual action, depending on the pull station, you have to either lift or push in a panel or smash a piece of glass, then pull the lever.

,
If there is a cover on the pull station, lift the cover and then pull the lever on the pull station.,
Some older systems have break glass stations.,
Sometimes (not very often), old systems will have coded pull stations.,
If you are in Europe, the UK, Australia, Japan, or on a majority of large seagoing vessels (cruise ships, ferries, charter boats, riverboat casinos, etc.),
If there are no pull stations in the building or you don't know where they are, go to a desk or office to report the fire, or tell a nearby employee.

",How to Pull a Fire Alarm," A pull station is the device found on the wall with instructions such as ""pull down"".;
,,, The pull station cover might sound a local alarm, but it doesn't set off the building's fire alarm system. To set off the building's fire alarm system, you have to pull the lever.

, These have a striker plate with spikes which breaks a glass sheet, releasing a button within the station. To activate one of these, simply:


Find the nearest station.






Using the side of your clenched fist, forcefully strike the plate that rests in front of the glass sheet.






Sometimes the glass gets so old it thickens and might not break from the impact of your fist, and you obviously don't have time to locate a bodybuilder. Therefore you might have to hit it several more times, kick the station, or use something with more heft (bookbag, baseball bat, etc).






If that still does not work, you'll have to find another pull station in a safe location quickly.







, These are much larger than normal pull stations and have a gear mechanism that is wound up when pulled. This mechanism pulses a code (ex.:1-4-2) to the horns/bells that building security would use to determine where the fire is.


Find the nearest pull station






The lever in these pull stations will go back up, so don't go crazy pulling it over and over, it works just fine. However, these pull stations only transmit four rounds of code before resetting themselves, so you might need to pull it more than once if security doesn't come right away, and preferably tell somebody about the fire after pulling a second time.







, they will more likely have what are called call points. These look like pull stations but instead use a thin piece of glass to hold the button in. Simply:


Locate the nearest call point.






Press your thumb on the center dot (usually with an ""X"" or ""O"" in it), breaking the glass and releasing the button.

Circle objects instead of pointing.,
Use the laser pointer sparingly.,
Be aware that the beam doesn’t end.,
Hold the laser pointer over your head.",How to Use Laser Pointers Safely2," Oftentimes, aircraft can look like stars from far away. Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft is not only illegal, it can be extremely dangerous to the pilot of the plane. Even if you are certain that you are pointing at a star, it is best to circle the object with the laser instead of pointing at it., The laser pointer is simply a tool in your toolbox to view the sky. Other people around you may be trying to watch the stars as well and you don’t want to ruin their experience. Once the people you are with know what star to look at, turn the beam off.Use the laser just long enough to identify what you are looking at.

, Although it may seem that the beam of your laser pointer only goes a few hundred feet, it actually does not end. The beam continues to travel even if you can’t see it. High powered beams can cause a distraction for up to 22 miles.When using the laser pointer, always act as though the beam continues to infinity and be aware that it can get close to aircraft and cause problems.

, To avoid accidentally pointing the beam at someone’s eyes, hold the laser pointer over your head with an outstretched arm. Only activate the button for the beam when you are certain that no one is in the line of sight of the beam. Release the button to deactivate the beam before you lower your arm.Remember, never point the beam directly at another person or animal.

Never aim a laser pointer at planes, trains, boats, or automobiles.,
Do not bring laser pointers to concerts or sporting events.,
Never point the laser pointer at animals.,
Avoid skin contact for prolonged periods of time.",How to Use Laser Pointers Safely3," The bright light from the beam can temporarily blind or distract the operator of the vehicle. This is extremely dangerous to all of the passengers on board. A laser beam in an airplane cockpit is not just a continuous beam, but appears as a flash that is very distracting.It is actually illegal to aim laser pointers at planes and you can be arrested for it.

, At these types of events there are large crowds of people and you can’t be sure that your beam will not end up in someone’s eyes. Aiming the beam at the stage or at a player on the field is annoying both for other viewers and for the players themselves.If you have no specific need for the laser pointer, leave it at home.

, Just as you shouldn’t point the laser beam at a person, you should never point it at an animal either. Animals have very similar eyes to ours and they can be harmed by the beam. In addition, you can frighten or confuse the animal by accidentally flash blinding them with the bright light.If you see someone aiming a laser pointer at an animal, gently let them know that this is unsafe.

, Most laser pointers are not powerful enough (5 mW) to actually damage your skin, but it’s best if you don’t shine the laser on your skin. Stronger lasers (500 mW) can actually burn your skin if you shine them for too long. It is safe to test that the pointer is working by briefly shining it into your hand.

Get comfortable with the vehicle.,
Adjust your seat, seatbelt, and mirrors.,
Pretend you're driving.,
Remove distractions.,
Remember that driving should be fun, once you get the hang of it.",How to Overcome the Fear of Driving for the First Time," Sit in the driver's seat and learn about that particular vehicle. Find all the basic controls, such as the windshield wiper function, the lights, seatbelts, blinker, and pedals.;
, First, slide the seat forward or backward so you can reach all the pedals with the correct feet. Then buckle yourself in, and if the seatbelt is adjustable, make sure it is not too high on your neck. The mirrors should be adjusted every time you enter the vehicle, beginning with the rear-view mirror. Tilt the mirror so you can see clearly out the back windshield, and make sure your night-vision function is off. Both side mirrors should be turned so you can see your car on the inside the mirror, and anything behind or beside you should be on the outside the mirror.

, If you were driving, what would you do? Go over stopping procedure, turning procedure, and shifting if you are in a manual-transmission vehicle. Make sure you're familiar with all the basic controls/levers/switches and their locations.

, Make sure you are driving with a person you can trust and rely on, and kick everyone else out of the car. You do not need to have an audience when you are learning. Leave the radio off - or play classical music quietly. Make sure you're well hydrated and that you've used the restroom before you get into the car.

, Don't treat the vehicle like an enemy - it will get you wherever you want to go, if you know how.

You'll get all the vitamins and minerals you need if you eat a varied diet. If the options in your home or at school are always the same, start working on getting some variety.Get plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits. Eat them raw and cooked.
Juice lacks fiber and can't provide all the benefits of whole produce, so don't replace your eating with drinking.
Get protein every day. If you're a vegan or a vegetarian, make sure you get adequate amounts of protein-rich foods like rice and beans, hummus, tofu, and nuts.
Eat whole-grain carbohydrates for energy and minerals.Yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese, and milk are delicious and provide essential calcium.;
, Homemade food is almost always lower in calories than frozen or prepared food. Tell your parents you want to pack your own lunches. If your parents buy a lot of take-out, ask them if you can all start taking turns making dinner several nights a week.


Your parents are going to worry if they think you're starving yourself. They're less likely to worry if they can see that you are eating well and getting interested in food preparation.

, Skipping meals will make you gain weight. Make sure you eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with some healthy snacks in between.You will overeat if you get too hungry. Try keeping a few snack bars, nuts, apples, and other filling snacks in your locker or backpack so that you can eat when you're hungry.


Make sure you get breakfast! Skipping breakfast will make you hungry and low-energy. It may even lead to weight gain., Don't consume these things every day, but don't eliminate things you like completely. Treat sugary drinks and snacks as treats. Consume them as a special occasion. If you get out of the habit of eating sugar all the time, you won't crave it as much.


Alcohol is very high in sugar, and it's best to avoid it if you're trying to lose weight., If you eat when you are stressed or distracted, you might eat too much or eat the wrong things. Try paying attention when you eat. Eat slowly so that you notice yourself filling up. Start eating when you're hungry, and stop eating when you're full.


Try tasting every bite you take.
Eat with your family. Eating with people you like can help you eat the right way.
Most restaurants will serve you more than you need to feel full., Dieting can actually make you gain weight. Most diets will cause you to lose weight at first, then gain it all back. The best way to have a healthy weight is to eat a healthy diet, get ordinary amounts of physical activity, and feel fine about your body and your habits.Avoid any crash diets that claim you can lose a lot of weight at once.
Never take laxatives, skip meals, vomit, or take weight loss pills to lose weight., It's hard to calculate your own correct weight, because everyone's healthy weight is different. You can calculate your BMI, which is how you find out if your weight is correct for your height, but the BMI fails to factor in things like your genes and your growth.You can talk to your doctor during an ordinary doctor's appointment.


Talk to your pediatrician, who has a record of your weight over your whole childhood, and ask if you are an ordinary weight for your age.
You might also ask: ""I'd like to lose weight. How can I do this safely?""
Your doctor might refer you to a nutritionist who can give you advice.

, When you stress about food, you make worse eating choices.If you worry too much about your weight, your calorie intake, and eating the ""right"" foods, you may make worse and worse eating choices, and even develop an eating disorder.


To strike a positive balance, try eating healthily but having the occasional treat.
If you overeat, don't beat yourself up. Let it go.

, Get into a regular exercise routine so that you get fit and stay fit. Aim for an hour of physical exercise a day.Consider trying out for a team sport, like swim team or volleyball.


If you're not competitive or don't like teams, try solo exercise like biking, jogging, skateboarding, or walking.
Get an exercise buddy. If you have a friend who enjoys exercise, ask if they'll go on hikes with you, or join a dance class and learn ballroom dancing or contradance.
You can lift weights, but wait till you're fully grown. You can't build muscle if you haven't gone through puberty.

, If you lose a ton of weight all at once, your parents will notice and you'll damage your health. If you lose a few pounds a month, you'll be losing weight safely, it will be easier to keep it off, and nobody will worry. It's safe to lose 1-2 pounds a week—any more than that is hard to keep off, and may damage your health.If you lose a lot of weight very quickly, you might actually damage your body's metabolism. This will make it hard for you to control your weight later on.Avoid compulsive exercise. This is when you feel like you can't control your own urge to exercise—you must exercise, or you can't relax. This is a warning sign that you may be developing an eating disorder.

, Getting a healthy amount of sleep every night will help you regulate your weight.If you're a teenager, aim for 9-11 hours of sleep a night.Naps can't make up for lost sleep, so try to go to bed at a reasonable time every night.


If you sleep fewer than 9 hours a night, try adding hours on. You'll lose weight for every hour you add (up to 11—after that, you'll just confuse your body).
To get enough sleep, get into a good sleep routine. Go to bed at the same time every night if you can, and do relaxing things before sleep, such as reading, chatting with family, or watching a comedy.

, Being on your device can cause you to zone out and lose track of time. Try replacing your online time with sleep, reading (offline), and activities that involve movement (walking, cooking, making art, exercising)., Remember that your brain and body are developing. If you restrict too many meals, you can damage your future health and intelligence. You can also lower your current concentration and self esteem. Too much focus on weight loss can lead you to be unhappy and ill.If you have trouble feeling comfortable with your current weight, consider talking to your friends about it. You don't have to ask questions or beg for reassurance—just let them know that you're having negative feelings about your body.

, You'll scare your parents if you start eating less or exercising too much, and you'll scare them if you aren't honest with them about your diet and your worries. If you are trying to lose weight without your parents knowing, ask yourself why. If you're really doing something harmless, why is it a secret?


If the issue is that your parents are controlling, speak to a trusted adult.
If the issue is that you have an eating disorder, you can speak to your school nurse or your doctor.
Diets work better with family support.

, If you're trying to lose weight without your parents knowing, you might have an eating disorder. Ask yourself: do I think about food all the time? Do I eat when I'm full? Do I avoid eating? Do I try to get rid of the calories I consume, either through vomiting, laxatives, or exercise?


If any of these are the case, talk to your doctor as soon as possible.If you think of your eating or your body as a problem, talk to a doctor.

Wear a helmet.,
Find a qualified supervisor.,
Know the symptoms of concussion.,
Strengthen your neck muscles.Athletes with strong neck muscles may be able minimize the high-speed impact of, for instance, a tackle on the football field.,
Inspect the playing field.,
Practice good sportsmanship.Good sportsmanship means playing with honor, decency, and a respect for your teammates, yourself, and your opponents.,
Don’t engage in full-contact play until you’re of late adolescent age.Children under the age of twelve should not be allowed to engage in full-contact sports such as football, hockey, rugby, boxing, and martial arts.,
Use proper technique.",How to Prevent a Concussion1," In many contact and non-contact sports that carry a potential risk of head injury, helmets are encouraged or required. For instance, when riding a bike or playing football, helmets are used to protect the head, and can prevent concussions.Choose a helmet that fits. Depending on your age and the size of your head, your helmet will fit differently than your friend’s helmet. All helmets should fit snugly — but not tightly — with no spaces between the soft foam of the helmet and your head.Ensure the helmet you’re wearing is certified for use and worn appropriately. For instance, don’t wear a bike helmet when riding a motorcycle; instead, wear a motorcycle helmet. Similarly, wear your helmet with all straps and fasteners connected securely.Wear your helmet every time you engage in an activity that would require a helmet. Make it a part of your activity gear. For instance, when getting ready to play baseball, pack your bag, glove, baseball, and batting helmet.;
, Ensure someone is present to monitor you and your team when playing a contact sport.Your supervisor could be a coach, physical fitness instructor, doctor or another person. Whoever you have supervising your play, they should be properly trained and qualified to identify situations in which a concussion could occur. If the monitor sees that someone in the game is at risk for a concussion, they must take the necessary steps to prevent it.

, Ask your coach to educate you and your teammates about concussions and their symptoms.For example, they might tell you to watch for nausea, vomiting, slurred speech, confusion, and dizziness following a serious head injury.Concussions can also produce a variety of delayed symptoms such as disrupted sleep patterns, headache, memory problems, difficulty concentrating, and disorders in taste and smell.


Speak up if you have concussion symptoms. Accept the decision of your coach if they believe you are at risk for a concussion.
Help your friends and parents understand concussions as well. A culture in which everyone is alert to the dangers of concussions will help prevent them from occurring.

, Exercises like moving the head up and down, with the chin touching the chest, can strengthen the neck. Moving your head from side to side so that you can look behind you and over your shoulder may also improve neck strength.

, Examine the playing field for holes or uneven terrain.No matter what sport you’re playing, you’re more likely to suffer a concussion if the terrain cannot be easily traversed. Check the field before playing to ensure it is free of holes and patchy areas. Insist that any holes are filled in before beginning play.


Ensure end posts and equipment are padded.End posts on a football field, or the sides of soccer goals, should be padded to ensure that players do not strike their heads against them accidentally. Sports padding is available from major sporting goods stores and manufacturers of sports equipment.

, If players are less aggressive on the playing field, they will be less likely to both inflict and suffer concussions.


Helping others up when they fall (even when they are not your teammates), apologizing and admitting to foul play, and shaking hands at the end of a game are all examples of how you can demonstrate good sportsmanship.
Do not play with others who will not play by the rules and demonstrate respect for others both on and off the field.

, Instead, focus on developing general fitness, agility, and hand-eye coordination in non-contact sports such as baseball, basketball, and golf.

, In a contact sport like football, using the proper technique to tackle is important in minimizing injuries. Coaches and parents should focus on teaching good technique. For instance, it is not acceptable to ""spear,"" or lead with the head, when tackling. The head should never make contact first — shoulders should be used to hit, not helmets.Head-first contact can be observed in sports other than football. It is imperative you emphasize that this is not a safe technique and can lead not only to concussions but also serious neck and cervical-spine injuries."

Consult with a medical professional.,
Determine if you actually need to lose weight, and if so, how much.,
Make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons.,
Be realistic about losing weight fast.,
Make your health your priority.",How to Lose Weight Fast (Teens)1," It is advisable for anyone embarking on a diet to talk with a doctor or registered dietitian first, because making sudden lifestyle changes, even good ones, can harm an unprepared body.


Teens especially should consult with a professional, because their growing bodies have particular nutritional needs, and because teens often have unrealistic views of what constitutes a healthy weight.
To repeat, weight loss should never be undertaken alone, without any guidance, especially for teens. A sensible plan, tailored to your specific needs, in combination with the right support network, will increase the odds of weight loss success and reduce the possibility of negative health impacts.;
, Due to the types of peer pressure common in high school settings, as well as unrealistic, “airbrushed” body image ideals promoted in popular culture, many teens who are sure they need to shed pounds are actually already at a healthy weight.


Sadly, in a culture where millions of teens would benefit from losing weight, many who don’t need to lose weight end up endangering their health and well-being by attempting to do so.
This, again, is why it is important to consult with a healthcare professional first. You need to establish whether you need to lose weight, and if so, set up realistic, healthy goals for your weight loss regimen. It is unwise and possibly harmful to try to do this on your own.Determining your Body Mass Index (BMI) is one way to gauge your goal for weight loss (or weight gain, for that matter). BMI calculators are available online, specifically calibrated for teen girls, for instance.. A BMI calculation is not a substitute for medical advice from a professional, however, which will factor in details like your overall health and medical and family histories.

, Teens should only undertake a weight loss regimen in order to improve their health, and, in combination with this, their mental/emotional well-being.Being overweight can cause undue stress, negative self-image, and possibly problems like depression or even a desire to harm oneself. Under the proper guidance, and with the right emotional support network — perhaps including professional assistance — a healthy weight loss plan can help resolve such issues.
Don’t try to lose weight to make your boyfriend happy, or to look like that model in the magazine ad. Do it for you — for your health, and your happiness.

, Yes, this article promises help in losing weight “fast,” but “fast” in this case needs to be a relative, and realistic, term.


Generally speaking, unless you are under the specific guidance of a physician, any regimen that averages more than two pounds lost per week is not considered safe or healthy.“Quick fix” plans and fad diets can be bad for your health in and of themselves, and are unlikely to address the root causes of why you are overweight. Thus, they make it more likely that your weight will rebound back up after a short-term loss, which can have negative physical and psychological effects.Think of it in terms of the old story of the tortoise and the hare. We all want to shed the excess pounds quickly, but “slow and steady” tends to win the battle against obesity.

, It cannot be stated often enough, especially for teens. Lose weight only to improve your health, and don’t endanger your health by losing weight.


Skip the diet pills that can have unknown and damaging side effects, and the starvation diets (anything under 1600 calories for the average teen) that can lead to ongoing health problems.Losing weight is about changing your life for the better, not risking long-term damage for some temporary satisfaction. Teens can have trouble thinking in the long term, which is why the right support network, including family, friends, and experts, is of such importance.

Limit the amount of TV you watch.",How to Lose Weight During the School Year (Girls)," Start off by weighing yourself so you can track your progress. How many pounds do you want to lose? Keep in mind that an average person in middle, high school loses 2 pounds per week maximum. Once you've figured out your target weight and how many pounds you'd like to lose, figure out how long you have to lose the pounds, and start thinking about specific goals.


Your goals need to be (1) specific; (2) attainable (doable); and (3) forgiving (less than perfect).In other words, ""lose weight"" is not a good goal because it's not specific. ""lose 30 lbs in 10 days"" is not a good goal because it's not attainable. ""Exercise for 3 hours every day"" is not a good goal because it's not forgiving. You want your goals to be something like, ""Exercise 5 days a week, with the goal of losing 2 lbs a week."" That leaves a little wiggle room to keep you on track.;
, The fact of the matter is that going low-calorie is not effective for everyone. That and it's hard. Do it for a week and you may end up breaking down, binging on everything in sight. Would low-carb be easier? How about just cutting out desserts? Picking up a vegetarian diet?


Science is starting to suggest that eating right and exercise isn't everything. It's also about how your body is made up. Put two people on the same diet and they're going to have different results.So don't stress about trying to fit someone else's box of what a diet really is – concentrate on what you think will work for you.

, Once you figure out what you need to lose, the second step is to figure out how to lose it. Will you be focused on your diet? What kind of diet? And what about exercise? Create a basic plan detailing your exercise schedule and your diet regimen.


An example of an exercise schedule could be ""Monday: 30 min. cardio, 10 min. stretching/yoga, 20 min. strength/toning exercises; Tuesday: 20 min. light cardio and walking; Wednesday: rest; Thursday: 20 min. light cardio and walking, 20 min. strength training; Friday: 20 min stretching/yoga, 30 min. cardio. And don't forget that activities like swimming and dancing count, too.

, Everything is easier with a friend. Not only do they keep your spirits up, but they hold you accountable. When your friend is sitting there, eating a salad and some fruit and about to go for a walk, you'll be less likely to chow down on half a pizza and then take a nap. What's more, you'll have someone to bond with over the woes of weight loss.


Practically everyone is ""dieting"" in some form or another nowadays. Just ask your friends who'd like to lose a few pounds with you and watch their arms shoot up. You are not alone in your battle, that's for sure.

, Technology is great for tracking your weight loss; you can use an app on your phone or other mobile device like ""MyNetDiary"" to keep you going. When you see how far you've come, you'll be motivated to keep going.


Try to weigh yourself once or twice a week, but not obsessively. You will aggravate yourself too much and risk giving up in frustration.

, Water, water, water: it should be your personal motto. Always drink at least 6-7 glasses of water a day. This will flush out your body and keep your skin crystal clear. What's more, it can curb hunger, too, keeping your stomach full.


Always stay hydrated (and less hungry!) with water and take 5-10 minute breaks in between each routine to keep from exhausting yourself early and to prevent possible vomiting if you push yourself too hard.
Stay away from sugary drinks that just spike your insulin and are full of empty calories. This includes juices and fancy coffee drinks – not just sodas. And while diet soda is technically better for you, you may see that you lose more weight when that diet soda gets replaced with water.

, Schools are all about providing large groups of people with, cheap, decent food. They're not about helping you lose weight. To avoid someone else determining your diet for you, pack your own lunch. Here's what it should include:


Plenty of vegetables
Few carbs and a slice of whole wheat bread or two should be it
A fruit, like strawberries or grapes
A protein source, like chicken, eggs, fish, peanut butter, or tofu

, In order to see consistent weight loss that keeps you motivated and feeling successful, you'll need to ditch the junk food. Anything that comes in a bag shouldn't be part of your dieting plan. Raw and fresh is the way to go to lose weight – processed foods have had their nutrients zapped out of them and are just full of sugars and salts that your body doesn't need. In fact, most processed goods have something in them that technically your body doesn't even recognize.It's all foreign junk that isn't good for you.


To replace that urge to munch on chips or cookies, instead go for a handful of nuts or berries you can munch on. Sometimes it's just the urge to chew that needs to sated, not eating itself.

, If you think that skipping meals will make you fit in those skinny jeans, think again. Your body will go into starvation mode and will start eating away nutrients in your fat. Then when you eat again, you will gain more weight because your body latches onto what you did give it and refuses to let go. This will just leave you with more fat than before. Breakfast in the morning keeps your metabolism going throughout the day, and gives you energy for school, work, and better food AND exercise choices.


Hard to believe? This is part of the reason why yo-yo dieting doesn't work. Once you've starved your body, it learns to adapt. Then when you feed it again, it can essentially stay in starvation mode, fearing the worst will happen again.By cutting back too far, you're just sabotaging your future self.

, In order to make sure you're not eating like you're living in an all-you-can-eat buffet, be sure to monitor how much of what you eat, too. Here are a few tips to make eating less easier:


Try to use smaller plates to make your food look bigger. Science says blue plates are better for less hunger, too.Eat slowly and savor your food. For every bite, try to chew for 5 seconds, then swallow, wait 3 seconds and drink a sip of water. Confusing? It's not. It's the 5-3-D.
Try to eat protein at every meal. Chicken, steak, and beef should be about the size of a deck of cards. Eating more protein keeps you fuller for longer, resisting that urge to snack on something you shouldn't be snacking on.

, For those days when your diet is getting to you, munch on something to make you feel better. Some dark chocolate, a sugary fruit, a few pretzels, or even a glass of red wine. Putting everything you love off limits is a recipe for disaster. You have to have something to keep you going.


Many people believe in calorie cycling. That's the idea where some days you eat a lot and some days you eat a little to keep your body guessing. Others choose one day a week where they eat whatever they want and the other six days they follow a stringent plan and ultimately this keeps them on track longer. So it's not all ""cheating."" Some of it is actually a good idea.

, 5 meals, instead of 3? Almost sounds too good to be true. But research says that eating often stabilizes your metabolism and keeps you from bingeing later on. That's right. So have breakfast, a morning snack, lunch, an afternoon snack, and dinner. All small, of course.


It's about eating more often, not about eating more in general. If you do want to implement the ""eat more often"" idea of dieting, make sure your meals are actually getting smaller, otherwise you'll just feel like you're dieting when you're really not.

, Whether it's your school, work, or social schedule that is taking up all your time, you need to always make time to exercise. And if you say you don't ""have time,"" you're likely not making cutbacks where you can. It's a matter of making exercise a priority above the other things you have to do. Even if it's just 15 minutes, it counts.


Not only should you be making time to exercise, but you should be making time to eat right, too. What's this mean? It means set time aside to go grocery shopping, to pack your own lunches, and to cook at home. Restaurants are some of the biggest culprits when it comes to foiling a strong diet plan. And besides, cooking is easier on your budget, too.

, When you're in school, it's hard to realize that there will be no other time in your life when being active is as easy. When you're a full-fledged adult in the work force, no one is putting up flyers and posting tryouts for a practically infinite number of activities. So take advantage of it! Sign up for something, even if you're not great at it, it will be an awesome (mandatory) workout (that you can't really get out of).


Alright, so not everyone can handle a school sport. A decent alternative? Marching band. You laugh now, but it's not easy holding up an instrument and walking around in the summer sun for hours at a time. And as for your lung capacity? Won't be a problem. So if you're more musically inclined, this could be the route to go.

, In high school and college, physical education is largely becoming optional. Don't cave to the temptation! When else are you going to be able to take time out of the middle of your day just to mess around with peers and throw around a few balls? Likely never. And you're getting credit for it? That's a win win.


Did we mention it's easier on your brain, too? You can only handle so many legit courses at a time, so consider gym class your break. Between school, a job, and your extracurriculars, you've earned it.

, Try to go to bed on a routine every day, even on weekends, to keep your body energized and ready to make good choices all day. Sleep restores our hormones to normal, stabilizing our hunger.What's more, it keeps your skin glowing and healthy. As often as possible, aim for at least 8 hours a night.


Oh, and while you're sleeping, you're still burning calories. You're also not eating, so where can you go wrong?

, Why? Well, for starters it gets you sitting on your butt and not doing anything. But what's worse is that watching TV makes us want to mindlessly eat even when we're not hungry. If you don't watch TV, the urge to eat may not even present itself. Eating while you're distracted is one of the biggest reasons teens are overweight.If you are hungry and your favorite program is on, get a snack and portion-control it. Put however much of the snack you should eat in one bowl, and eat that. No going back for refills. When your show is over, get up and go for a walk or do something active to get your mind off your hunger.

Talking to a doctor or registered dietitian before embarking on a program is the best way to set the proper goals and methods for your healthy weight loss.

Peer pressure and body image issues can make school-age young people particularly susceptible to the mistaken belief that they need to lose weight. If you are healthy just the way you are, focus only on maintaining that health and increasing your self-esteem and confidence.
If you do need to lose weight, don’t focus on a set number, or trying to look just like some famous person or popular schoolmate. Instead, establish with a professional what your healthy weight range should be and how best to reach it.;
, You may want to believe that there is some miracle fix that will let you shed five pounds in the week before school starts; however, any fad diet that promises such results is either a lie or detrimental to your health.Also, even if they do work temporarily, quick-fix diets don’t produce lasting results.
Aiming to lose 1, and possibly at most 2 pounds per week is considered healthy for most people. Consult your doctor or dietitian.

, If you really want to lose weight before the new school year starts, your best option is to begin the process as soon as the prior school year ends. The tortoise and the hare weren’t concerned with shedding pounds, but “slow and steady” is definitely the way to win this race.


If you want to lose weight and keep it off then you need to make lasting changes to your lifestyle, including how you eat, how you think about food, and how active you are in your daily life. This takes time, as it requires you to recondition your brain and body., Weight loss works best when it is not a solo endeavor. Everyone needs a boost, an encouraging word, or a kick in the pants from time to time in order to succeed. Getting family, friends, and trusted advisors involved is your best option.It can be tough to stick with a salad with canned tuna on top when your brothers are inhaling a pizza from your favorite shop. Ask for some understanding as you try to change your habits, or better yet, see if you can get the rest of your family on board.
It always helps to have someone you trust as a sounding board for those times when your cravings are getting the better of you or your confidence is low. If an organized weight loss program provides the support you need, by all means utilize one.
You can be part of your own support network by keeping a food diary. Keeping track of what you eat, how much you eat, and why you eat, along with your lifestyle changes, exercise activities, and overall feelings, can help keep you self-motivated.

, How much of your eating do you do because you are actually hungry? Often, people eat when they’re bored, stressed, or feel pressured or obligated to do so. Reducing calorie intake is critical to weight loss, and eating only when your body needs sustenance is a good step in that direction.Look for other outlets to alleviate your stress or boredom. When weight loss is your goal, exercise is great option — jogging, for instance, can clear your head and keep you away from the junk food cupboard.
When you do eat, focus on your food and eat slowly. Turn off the TV and eat only at a table, not standing or sitting on the couch. Think about what you are eating. Savor each bite. Stop when you are full.
Giving yourself challenges can also make eating more interactive and limit mindless consumption. For instance, try eating with chopsticks if you aren’t already handy with them.

, Few people can succeed by going “cold turkey,” switching from an unhealthy to a healthy diet overnight. For most, an incremental transition is the best means to long-term weight-loss success.Remember, you need time to re-train your mind, body, habits, and taste buds. Be patient.
Start with small changes. For instance, start by getting the smaller version of your favorite fast-food meal, and get small soda instead. Your ultimate goal will be to largely eliminate these items, but incremental reductions in portion size and calorie intake can help you onto that path., Water is good for everyone, but it can be the dieter’s best friend. It is nourishing, refreshing, and can even be filling, without adding a single calorie to your intake.


Unless you have a specific need for the nutrients in sports drinks (if you are very physically active for a long period of time, for instance), sticking to water is the simplest and lowest calorie (as in zero calorie) way to hydrate effectively.Always drink a glass of water before you eat something. Often, when people think they are hungry, they are actually just thirsty. Water, and perhaps just a small, healthy snack, can be enough to see you through to your next meal. Water can also limit the amount you actually eat at that meal.

, Generally speaking, if you’re looking to lose weight before school starts, that means it’s summertime. Thankfully, summer is the ideal season to seek out fresh fruits and vegetables, which need to be at the heart of your healthy diet.Don’t think of summer as a time to indulge in junk, but rather as the time to take advantage of nature’s bounty.
Depending on your climate, you can go from emphasizing fresh berries and peas, to peaches and tomatoes, to apples and corn, all the while helping your local farmers and the environment (by cutting out long-haul shipping).
Whether you can source them locally or not, also add more whole grains, lean proteins (summer is a good time for fishing, for instance), and more fiber-rich foods.

, With their growing bodies, teens in particular can have the urge to eat almost constantly. Choosing the right snacks to carry you through to the next meal can make a huge difference in the success of your weight-loss plan.Make snacks like chips and candy a rare treat. Focus instead on healthy, easy-to-prepare/carry/eat fruits, vegetables, and foods with whole grains, lean protein, and fiber.
For instance, consider pre-packaging any of the following in small sandwich bags: apple slices with peanut butter and raisins; grapes and string cheese; trail mix; edamame; or hummus spread inside a whole-wheat pita. The options are nearly endless, and by packaging them yourself, you'll reduce your inclination to head for the vending machine or candy drawer when hungry between meals.

, Diets that feel like punishment are doomed to fail. The goal is to retrain yourself to see treat foods (double-fudge brownies or double cheeseburgers, for example) as just that — occasional treats and not signs of failure.


Don’t make any of your favorite foods completely “off-limits.” You’ll only obsess about them more and feel even worse if you do slip up. Focus on practicing portion and frequency control with unhealthy food options.When you do choose to indulge, savor every bite of that pecan turtle sundae. Eat slowly and deliberately, making every bite count. Make it last so you won’t need to repeat the process again too soon., If you’re on summer break, it’s easy to think of it as a temporary liberation from schedules; however, planning and regimentation are the allies of practically every successful weight-loss plan.


Set a summertime goal for yourself, ideally one that supports your weight-loss goals. For instance, pledge that you’re going to learn to rollerblade or be able to swim more laps than your sister.Keep your meals, snacks, and exercise time on a fairly consistent schedule. This makes it easier to track your progress and more difficult to make excuses for skipping out.
Get regular and sufficient sleep, but not excessive. Sleeping away your summer is not a good weight-loss plan.Ages six to 13 should get between nine and 11 hours of sleep; ages 14 to 17 should get eight to 10 hours of sleep; and those 18 to 25 need seven to nine hours., Unfortunately, tanning poolside does not meet this goal. You should strive to be physically active for at least 60 minutes every day.


If you are sweating at least a bit and breathing hard enough that it would be a challenge to sing, but you can still make conversation, then you are probably exercising at a beneficial level.
The 60 minutes of exercise does not have to happen all at once. Three 20-minute sessions seem to be just as beneficial as one 60-minute session.
Organized sports like soccer, swimming, and tennis fit the exercise bill. So to do activities like dance and aerobics classes. Though usually less of a calorie-burner, yoga also can benefit both body and mind as part of a weight-loss regimen., Especially if it gets oppressively hot where you live, it can be dangerous to engage in otherwise beneficial exercise during mid-day. If it’s too hot to go for your regular jog, adapt your schedule or find a different (but healthy) activity.Staying hydrated by drinking water is good for your weight-loss plan, and it is also especially important during hot stretches. Hydrate before, during, and after exercising. Plain old water is generally more than sufficient, and comes without all the calories, sugars, and additives of sports drinks.
In especially hot weather, either plan your exercise for early in the morning or later in the evening, or move your exercise indoors. Try DVDs, YouTube videos, or even games like Wii Fit that serve as an aerobic or strength training class you can do indoors.

, If you’re lucky, you probably have a bit more free time during your break from school than you will once classes start back up. You can take advantage of being in less of a hurry.Don’t drive when you can walk (or ride a bike). Sure, it’s less than a five-minute drive to your friend’s house, but making it a brisk 20-minute walk (40 round-trip) will fulfill much of your minimum activity goal for the day.
Take the stairs. Make the elevator your last resort.
Turn your pre-back-to-school activity time into some extra cash. Mow your neighbors’ lawns. Walk (or jog) some local dogs. Join a house painting crew, or help clean up the local park. Enjoy the great outdoors, look a bit trimmer, and fatten your wallet all at the same time.

Keep stairways safe.,
Keep your home well-lit.If your home is well-lit you will be more likely to see objects in front of you that could cause you to fall.,
Use appropriate safety equipment when working on your house.For instance, if you’re working on your roof, you should wear a helmet and slip-resistant boots.,
Clean up spills.If the floor is wet or greasy, someone could step in the spill and slip, leading to a concussion.,
Play on soft ground.If you have a home playground set in your backyard, install woodchips or sand below it.",How to Prevent a Concussion2," Your stairways should be clear of debris.If you have young children, they might be in the bad habit of leaving their toys strewn about. This is especially dangerous near staircases, where the possibility that you trip or slip on a toy could lead to a tumble down the stairs and end up with a concussion or broken bones.


Use stair gates.If you have little kids running about the house, they might not negotiate stairs as carefully as they should (or at all). Stair gates are low (about one meter high) gates that can extend up to two meters to corral an area off in order to keep pets and young children away. If you want to keep your kids or pets away from the stairs, place a stair gate in front of them in order to deprive them access to the stairs.
Adding carpet to the stairs to prevent slips.
Ensure handrails are present to steady yourself when using stairs.

, Immediately replace any bulbs that blow, and ensure the lighting illuminates the floors all over the house.


Don’t get in the bad habit of walking about your home at night with the lights off when you wake to check on your child or go to the bathroom.

, Always have a spotter hold the ladder steady when you’re climbing it. If you’re changing an overhead light, have a spotter and only stand on a step ladder or chair that doesn’t have wheels to minimize potential movement.

, Avoid this by immediately cleaning up spills with paper towels or damp rags. This is especially common around the kitchen where drinks are most likely to be spilled.


Prevent spills by drinking out of water bottles and giving children spill-proof cups. Keep cups away from the edge of the table. Move cups and other dishes to the sink when not in use.

, Dirt and grass may seem soft when compared to, say, concrete, but a fall on either can still produce a concussion. The impact of a fall on woodchips or sand, however, is distributed far better than a similar fall on dirt or grass.


In addition to installing woodchips or sand beneath your own home playset, take your children only to playgrounds where the equipment is installed above soft terrain.
If your child attends a school where the playground is on dirt or grass, talk with the principal about having some woodchips or sand installed.

Exercise regularly.,
Get checked out for dizziness.,
Manage anxiety disorders.,
Wear a seatbelt when traveling by car.",How to Prevent a Concussion3," As you age, your ability to balance declines. Vertigo, unsteadiness, and light-headedness can cause you to feel less confident when walking and may lead to concussive falls.Tai Chi, yoga, and dance are all forms of light exercise that can improve your sense of balance and smooth your movements.Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise five days a week.

, Feeling dizzy or lightheaded could cause you to fall, which might result in a concussion. If you are experiencing dizziness, you need to see a doctor for evaluation. There are many potential causes of this that need to be worked up, for instance, heart arrhythmia, anemia, electrolyte imbalance, medication side effects, stroke, and many more.


Sit or lie down if you feel dizzy.The easiest way to prevent a fall and subsequent concussion is to keep yourself out of situations that could lead to one. Don’t try to power through a vertigo episode or feeling of unsteadiness. This could lead to a head injury.
Additionally, don’t look at bright lights and TV for a while. Lie down and close your eyes when you feel yourself becoming lightheaded.

, Some anxiety disorders, especially those that may cause panic attacks, may cause you to feel woozy or lightheaded.Seek the help of a mental health professional to treat your anxiety.


Some ways to manage anxiety include deep breathing exercises, yoga, and meditation.
Taking care of yourself by eating healthy, exercising, and getting enough sleep can help you cope with anxiety., If you are in an automobile accident, you might injure your head. To prevent a head injury and ensure the appropriate application of airbags, wear your seatbelt.In addition, always wear a motorcycle helmet when riding a motorcycle or scooter and a bicycle helmet when cycling."

Limit restaurant meals.While it's possible to stick to your diet at a restaurant, you really have no idea what's going into your food back in the kitchen.,
Monitor your portion sizes.,
Get plenty of exercise.While changing your diet is essential to effective weight loss, regular exercise will enable you to burn off excess calories without sacrificing the nutritional value of the food you consume.,
Drink a lot of water.,
Stop drinking your calories.,
Avoid fad diets.When you want to lose weight fast, it's tempting to try any of the number of diets that promise immediate results.",How to Lose Weight Fast (Teens)2," You might think the fish is a great, low-calorie option without realizing that the first and last thing that went into the dish was butter.


There's nothing more frustrating than seeing weight gain or slowed loss when you think you're sticking to the plan. Preparing your own meals at home lets you control what you're putting in your body and keeps you on track.
Sometimes, you want to grab some food with your friends on the weekend. That's okay — you don't want to miss out on your social life for your diet.
When you do eat out, make sure to ask the waiter about how the dishes you're interested in are cooked to prevent any surprises that might frustrate your diet.
Don't be afraid to ask them to ask the kitchen if they don't know the answers.
Consider the portion sizes of restaurant foods. Ask if they have smaller portion options (order the 1/2 rack of ribs instead of the full rack), or before you even start eating, put a portion of the meal into a ""to go"" bag.

, If you live in the United States, you may have a concept of meal size that differs from most of the rest of the world. While the serving sizes on our nutrition labels are accurate, the portion sizes we serve ourselves in restaurants and at home are enormous!


Always start with less food than you think you'll need.Eat slowly to give your body time to process how full your stomach is getting — the brain needs about 20 minutes before it can tell the stomach is full.If you're still hungry after that, eat a little more until you're satisfied.
Use your hand to measure your portion sizes.For example, the recommended 3 oz. of meat in a serving fits in the palm of your hand. A cup of any food is about the size of a fist, while ½ a cup fits into a cupped palm (handful).

,


In other words, if you reduce calories strictly by eating less, you risk missing out on nutrients; reducing calories in part through exercise avoids this problem.
The best way to get fast results that keep you motivated is to combine your diet change with an active lifestyle. Plus, staying active during your teen years raises your chances of staying active into adulthood, ensuring healthy weight down the road.
Talk to your doctor, a trainer, or a professional at the gym to help you plan a safe and effective exercise program.
Try to get at least one hour of moderate exercise every day.
Try to make it fun — you don't have to grind it out at the gym by yourself! Enlist your friends to keep you company and make it a social activity, as long as you can stay focused.
Joining a sports team is a great way to spend time with your friends while getting a lot of structured exercise.
Even walking has health and weight-loss benefits and is a good way to start.

, No matter what kind of diet plan you're on, drinking lots of water will help you lose weight and keep it off. A recent study showed that drinking 17 oz. of water increased both men and women's metabolisms — the rate at which the body burns calories — by 30%!On top of that, drinking enough water can keep your body from confusing thirst for hunger, reducing your need to snack between meals. Drink a glass of water before meals, then drink another glass while you’re eating. Taking sips between bites slows you down as you eat and keeps your from eating past the point of fullness.
Make sure to drink at least 8 cups of water every day, but don't be afraid to drink more!
Drinking water also keeps your skin hydrated and can help keep acne in check.

, All those sodas and energy drinks are flooding you with calories that didn't satisfy your hunger. Water is the perfect, calorie-free drink that goes with every meal and keeps your body healthy to boot.If you need a morning pick-me-up, replace your Frappuccino with a black coffee.

, However, these ""fad diets"" often result in only temporary weight loss — usually from water weight.


Furthermore, they can pose real health risks if taken too far because they drastically limit what you can eat and cause nutritional imbalance.
For instance, eating nothing but grapefruit for two weeks will certainly help you lose weight, but you'll feel terrible. The weight will come back as soon as you return to a regular diet. Be wary of any diet that:

Promises quick weight loss
Helps a company sell a product (a supplement or detox drink, for example)
Lacks credible scientific research to support its claims
Seriously restricts your food options (eating cabbage soup for a week)



"
"
Don’t undertake a calorie reduction plan without proper guidance.,
Learn how calorie counting works.There's a big difference between calorie counting and just ""eating less."",
Determine your activity level.Calorie counting works by making sure you spend more calories through activity than you take in through food.,
Figure out how many calories you burn, then how many you should consume for healthy weight loss.,
Do not over-restrict your calorie intake.This is always worth repeating when it comes to teens and weight loss.,
Count your calories carefully.,
Look up the caloric content of non-packaged foods.,
Swap high-calorie for low-calorie foods.",How to Lose Weight Fast (Teens)3," Some experts even advise against calorie counting plans for teens, because growing bodies have particular and changing nutritional needs that may not be met with such diets.Any calorie counting plan, or calorie reduction plan in general, needs to emphasize the nutritional value of the calories consumed first and foremost. The advice of a health professional in setting up your plan is the best way to ensure this necessity., Calorie counting is a thoughtful approach that makes sure you stay within healthy energy and nutrition levels.


Without this thoughtful approach, you may end up with malnutrition.When we eat more calories than we need to get through the day, the body stores that energy away for later. Unfortunately, it stores it as fat.
By limiting our calorie intake, we encourage the body to burn off our excess fat for energy.

, Thus, you can’t set your new calorie limit until you figure out how many calories you burn on an average day. Decide where you fit among the following three options:


Sedentary Lifestyle: you spend most of your day sitting, whether at a desk at school or on the couch at home. Exercise isn’t part of your regular routine.
Moderate Activity: You’re active throughout the day, stay on your feet, and do heavier chores around the house like lawn mowing or vacuuming. You make room in your schedule for exercise several times a week, whether on your own or with a team at school, and you work yourself hard during these sessions.
Very Active: You exercise every single day and push yourself as hard as you can.

, For teenagers of high school age (14 – 18), each activity level burns approximately the following amount of calories per day:Sedentary: 1,800 in girls and 2,000 – 2,400 in boys
Moderately Active: 2,000 in girls and 2,400-2,800 in boys
Very active: 2,400 in girls and 2,800-3,200 in boys
One pound of fat is equal to 3,500 calories, so to lose one pound per week, you need to consume on average 500 fewer calories per day (3,500 per week) than you burn.Therefore, if you are a moderately active girl who wants to lose one pound per week, you need to eat 500 calories less per day than the 2,000 you burn; that is, 1,500 calories.
Please note, however, that teens who consume less than 1,600 calories per day risk malnutrition, so only undertake such a diet under the supervision of a medical professional.,


The most important thing about counting calories is making sure you still give your body enough fuel to get through the day. Pushing the limit will put a lot of strain on your vital organs and, over time, could result in serious health risks.
It is also bad for weight loss, as your body gets tricked into thinking it's starving. When this happens, it lowers its metabolism and hangs onto energy (in the form of fat) as long as it can, slowing down weight loss.
Under no circumstances should you eat fewer than 1,200 calories per day.

, The FDA requires all food labels to give accurate information about nutritional content, including calorie count. Use the information on those labels to keep track of how many calories you're eating throughout the day. Make sure to stay as close to your daily limit as possible.


There are many websites and phone apps you can use to track your calorie intake throughout the day. Some phone apps even have barcode scanners that let you input calorie data just by pointing your phone camera at the label.
Make sure to measure out your servings. That a bag of chips from the gas station might have 2.5, not 1 serving in it. Input your calorie information accurately.

, Ideally, you should be eating a lot of healthy fresh fruits and vegetables that don't come with nutrition labels on them. This can make it hard to tell how many calories you're consuming. Luckily, you can just look up the caloric count of these items online.Measure out your serving sizes to make sure you're getting your real calorie count. Measuring cups and food scales are the best way to ensure accuracy.

, Although you can lose weight through pure calorie restriction alone, regardless of how healthy the food is, it's better to eat nutritious options.Those foods, coincidentally, are usually lower in calories to begin with.


Look for foods that are low in calories, but dense in nutrition. Examples include raisins, leafy greens like spinach and kale, fresh vegetables and fruits like strawberries and carrots, and lean proteins like chicken and fish."
"
Educate yourself on carbs and low-carb plans.,
Consider the other benefits and possible risks of low-carb dieting.Cutting carbs is a quick way to lose weight, but studies show that it can have other health benefits as well.,
Fill your meals with nutritious, low-carb foods.,
Avoid carbohydrate-rich foods.,
Track your carbohydrate intake.",How to Lose Weight Fast (Teens)4," Carbohydrates are sugars and starches that the body converts to glucose, a type of sugar the body can use for energy.There are simple carbs (such as in fruits and vegetables) as well as complex carbs (bread, cereal, rice, potatoes, etc.), and some low-carb diets focus particularly on cutting out the latter. The biggest problem, however, is probably the consumption of ""empty carbs,"" or carb-rich foods with limited nutritional value (think potato chips, for instance).
There’s no single way to reduce carbohydrate intake. Some plans allow a limited amount of complex carbs, while others cut them out of the diet completely. If you stick to the diet, cutting carbs has been shown to quickly reduce weight, though it can return when you resume a normal diet.A good baseline for a low-carb diet is 60 – 130 grams of carbohydrates per day. Compare that to the 225 – 325 recommended for a regular, but still healthy diet.
Once again, your safest bet is to consult with a healthcare professional about low-carb diet options. Don’t blindly trust what you hear on commercials or see online.

, That said, it is not without risk.


Low-carb diets do seem to have an advantage over other diets in short-term weight loss; the evidence regarding long-term weight loss is less clear, although low-carb diets seem to be at least as effective in this realm as other diets.Low-carb diets may decrease your chances of heart disease by improving your HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It may also lower your blood sugar, decreasing your risk of developing diabetes. These benefits are associated with any weight-loss regimen, though, not just low-carb diets.
When you begin a low-carb plan, you may experience headaches, fatigue, constipation, and other symptoms as your body attempts to adjust. If your carb intake is too low, you risk nutritional deficiencies and disorders like ketosis, which occurs when you don’t have enough glucose stored for energy and your body responds with several unpleasant effects.

, Because so many of our calories usually come from carbohydrates, many people don't bother counting calories when they're on a low-carb diet. The foods you eat on a low-carb diet will fill you up and provide nutrition without bombing your body with calories. Typical foods on a low-carb diet include:Any type of fish or shellfish (excluding mussels and oysters)
Any type of poultry (chicken, turkey, etc.)
Any type of meat, assuming carbs haven't been added through processing. The most common culprits are bacons and hams that are cured in sugar.
Dark, leafy greens like spinach, arugula, and kale
All vegetables except for starchy ones like potatoes and parsnips.
Small amounts of cheese (about 1 gram per day)
Healthy fats and oils (butter, cold-pressed vegetable oils, olive oil, mayonnaise with no added sugar)

, The best thing you can do for yourself is stop eating processed foods. Though they're cheap and often delicious, they fill your body with empty calories without providing any significant nutrition. Foods to avoid include:Sugars: Some people choose to cut even simple sugars from fruits and juices out of their low-carb diets. At the very least, avoid the refined sugars found in soft drinks, candies, desserts, and sugary breakfast cereals. Avoid processed fruits (canned in syrup, dried).
Grains: This includes pasta, bread, rice, and cereal. Again, some people choose to cut all grains out of their diets. At the least, cut refined grains (white bread, white rice, regular pasta) out and opt for whole grain options (wheat or whole-grain bread, brown rice, whole-wheat pasta).
Starchy vegetables: Although potatoes and parsnips are vegetables, their starch content makes them a bad fit for a low-carb diet., Just like with calories, it's important to count your carbohydrates to make sure you're staying on track. This is especially important if you've decided to limit, but not completely eliminate common carbohydrate sources like bread and rice.


Check nutrition labels for carbohydrate counts
Measure food with measuring cups and a food scale
Keep track of your daily intake and make sure you stay within your daily limit.

Consume healthy foods and do not skip meals.,
Do light exercise before breakfast, even if it is only stretching.,
Avoid buying food in the school cafeteria or shop.,
Eat at the table, not standing up.,
Don't eat from 9pm to 6am.,
When you snack, choose healthy fruits and vegetables rather than candy or chips.,
Before you go to a restaurant, look at what there is on the menu online if you can, and choose what you want there (sometimes they even show you the nutritional information).,
Ask for smaller portions at meal times.,
Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day.",How to Lose Weight As a Teenager2," Eat five small meals each day, every 3-4 hours. Your blood sugar level will be steady, and you will not feel as hungry.

, Do not push your body too far until a couple hours after breakfast. Your body most likely will have very low energy stores, and this will result a loss in muscle before your body uses fat. You need fuel in order to burn fat, otherwise you're just using muscle as energy. Do NOT skip breakfast. It gets your body and metabolism moving and stops cravings later on. So even if it's just a banana and a cup of tea, it will do so much more than if you had nothing to eat.

, Bring a packed lunch and no money for food. That way, cravings are resisted. In your lunch, you should have sandwiches, two pieces of fruit and water. No sweets or fatty food.

, Have one specific place where you will eat all your meals (unless you are out with friends). This keeps you from eating food mindlessly in front of the TV. Take time to chew, count to 30 for each bite. Chewing more can help you lose weight. You will find that you will get full faster, and will not have to eat as much.


Remember that it takes at least 20 minutes to actually notice that you're full or not hungry anymore. Try not to overeat, when you feel satisfied stop eating and don't let yourself eat anymore if you're not finished.

, This will keep your body on a schedule. Because your metabolism isn't high at night (especially when you are sleeping), it also means your body won't be eating food when it can least digest it.

, If you really hate veggies, have some hummus or peanut butter with it, or instead, opt for a handful of unsalted nuts. Greek yogurt helps boost up your metabolism and tastes great (plain with honey and berries is an excellent choice). Popcorn, minus added salt or butter, are excellent munchies. They are full of fiber.

, Not only does this mean that you can choose something healthier, it also means that you aren't likely to give in to cravings and choose something you just can't eat.

, It's easier than trying not to eat everything you get because it's an automatic habit to finish your meals.Try eating on a smaller plate, too. It tricks your brain into thinking you've eaten more than you really have.

, You do not have to drink them down all at once, but keep sipping all day. Do whatever is comfortable and convenient for you, as long as you drink that amount of water. This will help you feel more full.


Other than water, almost anything you drink will contain calories. Learn to love the taste of water, and take in more fluids daily to improve your health and digestion. Fruit and vegetable juices, which are deprived of their fibers, are inferior to eating the fruits and vegetables themselves. Juices contain a lot of added sugar and many times are not even 100% juice, so try to avoid them. Try making your own juice at home with a juicer. It'as a great way to get tons of nutrients and adds in weight loss. It has also been proven that drinking three liters of water a day inhibits the loosening of skin, resulting in the formation of less wrinkles.

Walk as much as you can.,
Exercise.",How to Lose Weight As a Teenager3," The average person burns about six calories per minute walking. Try to walk at least one mile a day to start. Each day walk a little further. Walk at a brisk pace, and if you find you are getting out of breath then slow down. In the beginning it is more important that you at least walk, rather than walk fast.


Take the stairs instead of taking the elevator.
Walking just 15 minutes a day increases life expectancy by three years, studiessay.
Dance by yourself to the music on the television or your MP3 player. Any movements will make you lose weight, so have fun and dance your way to a thinner you!

, It doesn't matter if you lift weights, walk around your neighborhood, swim, or jog on a treadmill, you will lose weight, as long as you exercise 3-4 days a week, and burn more than your calorie intake. If you don't have a treadmill, find a pool, walk into waist deep water, and run in place, this burns just as many calories as running on a treadmill.

Weigh yourself every week on a certain day in the morning before you eat and after you go to the bathroom.,
Record your progress.,
Be confident.,
Don't be too hard on yourself!",How to Lose Weight As a Teenager4," This will show you've lost weight rather than weighing every day. If you are still growing, then your weight should not change at all. You will think that you have gained weight in fat but you really just have grown a bit or gained muscle. Measure around your waist instead. That way you see if you have lost fat.


Weighing yourself daily can lead to what some people call ""scale obsession,"" or an unhealthy fixation on daily results. Water retention in the body can be as much as five pounds per day, so the scale can also be somewhat misleading.
Remember to think of weight loss as an ongoing process. Your hard work and determination will pay off, however, so long as you keep your spirits high and your outlook optimistic. Very few people are completely satisfied with their bodies, but try to love your body as much as possible. It will definitely love you back.

, This way you can notice any major changes. Keep a log of everything you eat, every exercise you do, and how many inches your waist is (or whatever kind of body part that needs weight loss). Add up your total calorie intake of that day (try to keep it at a maximum of 2000) and how many calories you burned (most exercise machines will give you an estimate of how many calories you burned). If your diet or exercise changed you can see what plan worked best for you.


Also, if you record the calories you have eaten, you can input them in websites that will then calculate whether you should have eaten more, or fewer calories that day, and you can plan from that.
Download an app. There are some great apps that are free to download that can help you track your progress, such as MyFitnessPal and MapMyFitness. Check out your apps store and see what's on offer to help you.

, If you are confident about losing weight you will be more likely to have some great progress! It actually works!

, If you spend a day in your pajamas and watch a few movies for the day, don't sweat it. If you have a big feed of junk food one day, don't worry! Just get back on track the next day!

Start your day with breakfast.,
Have a healthy lunch.,
Introduce salads into your diet.,
Stay away from sugary and fried foods.",How to Lose Weight As a Preteen1," It should be the largest meal, as it provides you with energy for the day. Find low-calorie, healthy foods that contain nutrients, such as oats and orange juice. You can still have your favorite breakfast foods, but cut down on the amounts that you take in order to balance out your calories. For example, if you want pancakes and yogurt, give yourself three pancakes, a cup of low-fat yogurt, and about three tablespoons of maple syrup. By being moderate in your serving sizes, you can still enjoy your favorite foods while maintaining a healthy weight.


You should attempt to cut out syrups and sauces from your diet, as these contain high calories. Excess calories will eventually build up in your body, causing extra weight. Find a healthier alternative, such as lemon juice on pancakes.
Have a cup of green or mint tea. It speeds up the metabolism and also contains antioxidants.
If you crave sugar, replace sugary snacks with fruits. Mangoes, bananas, and an occasional drizzle of chocolate syrup are good for your body.;
, In order to maintain your energy levels throughout the day, introduce foods with carbohydrates into your diet. Pack a healthy sandwich, but cut back on the mayonnaise or jelly. If you like having spreads on your bread, find healthier ones with lower calories. Also, you could look up recipes for healthier sandwiches. Ones that contain healthy vegetables, such as lettuces and tomatoes, are excellent suggestions.

Think about why you (over)eat.,
Think about your long-term goals.,
Focus on the allowed foods you enjoy.When you frame your diet in terms of what you're missing out on, you start dreading your meals.,
Give yourself a cheat day.No matter how hard you try to focus on the positives, it can be hard to give up a food you really love — whether it's donuts or potato chips.,
Forgive yourself for occasional slip-ups.It's important to hold yourself accountable and stick to your diet.,
Talk to other people about your journey.",How to Lose Weight Fast (Teens)5," Many people who are overweight tend to over-eat not because they are hungry all the time, but because of boredom, unhappiness, social or family expectations, or just a lack of good information about healthy eating.This is one of the reasons why healthy, lasting weight loss is about more than just trying to eat less. Only by identifying and addressing root behaviors can a proper weight loss plan succeed. This is also why the right support network is so important.
If depression or some other condition is at the root of your struggle with your weight, the proper help is essential, before any concern about weight loss.
Teen weight loss is often most effective when the entire family is fully supportive. This does not necessarily mean that everyone has to go on a diet; it may, however, mean changing mealtime routines and replacing unhealthy eating habits with more nutritious alternatives.

, The hardest part of a diet is keeping yourself positive and motivated. Don't think about what you're missing out on. Instead, focus on how good it's going to feel when you can feel comfortable in your own skin and wear the clothes you want to wear.


When you see other people who look great, don't get jealous — focus on how good you’ll look (and feel) if you stick to your plan!

, Don't even think about what you can't eat. Instead, focus on the foods you're allowed to eat that you actually enjoy!


You don't have to eat broccoli if you don't like it — stick to munching on the carrots you love! So what if you can't eat bread? You can still eat the turkey from your beloved turkey sandwiches!
A diet shouldn't be a punishment. Put some thought into making your meals enjoyable so you look forward to them.

, If you deny yourself completely, you may get frustrated and give up.


A good way to avoid this is to allow yourself one ""structured"" cheat day a week. When the day is over, you'll have satisfied all your cravings and will be ready to put in another six days of healthy eating.
Don't cheat mindlessly. When you're eating forbidden foods on cheat day, really savor the experience. Enjoy that burger with all five senses, and eat it slow to make the experience last longer.

, But every once in a while, the urge to accept an offered cookie or soft drink might get the better of you — and that's okay!


If you ate 100 calories too much today, don't beat yourself up about it. Just work out a little harder tomorrow or eat especially healthy food.
Even though you want to lose weight fast, don't forget that weight loss is still a long-term process. Little mistakes here and there won't ruin your diet.
Cut yourself some slack, but rededicate yourself to your plan. You'll get there soon enough!

, Getting positive feedback and support from other people is a great way to stay motivated. If you have a friend or two who are also trying to lose weight, talk to them about your struggles on bad days or how you're feeling really positive on good days.


You can also find people to talk to in many online weight loss forums, where you can share your frustrations and successes with a lot of people who are going through the same thing.
Consider joining Weight Watchers or another respected weight-loss program for extra support and information. Many hospitals and medical clinics also have weight-loss centers to help teenagers lose weight effectively and safely.
Starting a friendly competition with friends and relatives can help you exceed your goals. Who can get the most steps in on their pedometer this week?

For your first few hikes, pick shorter trails (less than 1 mile or 1.6 kilometers) that are mostly flat and have lots of natural features to look at along the way, like lakes or waterfalls, cool rock formations, or animal habitats.Make sure to check the weather when planning your hike and also that morning. Bring layers if part of the day will be cooler.Remember to bring plenty of water.

You may think something like, ""I'm going to have a heart attack I'm so scared.""
Stop and question this. Ask yourself something like, ""Am I really going to have a heart attack? What is the worst thing that could actually happen?""

It's also a good idea to make sure that there are no other children at the bottom of the slide before you let your child slide down, especially if the slide twists so that children can not see the bottom of the slide from the top.

, Swing sets can also be dangerous, especially when they are placed too close to other playground equipment. Pay attention to how much space there is behind and in front of each swing, and make sure that there is adequate room so that a swinger would not hit children playing on other equipment.To be safe, the distance between the swing and any other equipment should be at least twice the height of the swing set. There should be at least six feet of space between the swing and any wall, tree, or fence.
Swings should also be at least 24 inches apart from each other to prevent children from swinging into each other.

, Any playground equipment that has moving parts, such as a seesaw, should be carefully inspected to ensure that a child's hand could not be pinched or crushed in the mechanism.To be safe, these moving parts should be out of a child's reach or completely covered.

, Public sandboxes can be unsanitary and potentially dangerous, so always inspect them carefully. It's best to avoid sandboxes unless you are sure that they are well-maintained. Don't allow your children to use a sandbox if it is not covered at night. An uncovered sandbox attracts animals, which may contaminate the sand with feces.
Always check the sandbox for debris and insects before allowing your children to play in it.

, Serious injuries from playground falls are much less likely when there is a soft, shock-absorbing material on the ground. Try to only visit playgrounds that have surface materials like rubber, sand, or mulch. Avoid playgrounds with lots of concrete or asphalt.While grass or dirt surfaces may seem safe, they do not absorb shock very well, so they can be almost as dangerous as a paved surface.

, In addition to inspecting the playground equipment, you should also pay attention to the ground in the playground area. Make sure there is nothing on the ground that could cause an injury, such as broken glass.Standing water can also be dangerous, as it can cause kids to slip.

, When looking at the ground, you should also pay attention to anything that may cause a child to trip and fall, whether it is part of the equipment or part of the natural landscape.Tree roots and rocks are potentially tripping hazards.
Anything that has a sudden change in elevation, including sidewalks, may also pose a danger.

, If the playground is in a busy area, you should always check the fence to make sure that it is secure enough to keep children in the playground area. A faulty fence could allow children to run into traffic or other unsafe conditions.The fence should also not be sharp or rusty, as this could cause injury to a child.

, The best way to prevent common playground injuries is to supervise your children while they are playing. If you keep a close eye on them, you can prevent them from doing something dangerous that could cause them to get hurt.Intervene if you see your child leaning over a railing, climbing on equipment that is not intended to be climbed on, or doing anything else that may be unsafe.
If the playground is not designed in such a way that it is easy to supervise your children, find a new playground.

, Children can get injured when they try to use playground equipment that is designed for children who are much bigger or much smaller than they are. To avoid this, always explain to your children which pieces of equipment are safe for them and which are intended for other age groups.For example, a twelve-year-old should not attempt to sit in a baby swing.
Likewise, a two-year-old should not climb a rock wall without close supervision.

, There are lots of things on a playground that can snag clothing, which can lead to strangulation. To avoid this, make sure your child is not wearing any loose article of clothing or jewelry before going to the playground. Items that are worn around the neck are particularly dangerous.


Scarves, necklaces, and bicycle helmets are all potentially dangerous on the playground., It's important that kids understand the fact that injuries can happen on the playground, and that they know how to prevent them. Talk to them about how to play on the playground safely.Make it clear that roughhousing is never acceptable on the playground, even if it is friendly.
You may also need to teach your kids to use the equipment. For example, children may not understand that standing on swings is dangerous unless you tell them so."
"
Talk to others about your fear.,
Despite seeing ""missing"" stories from the media, understand that the chances of being abducted by a stranger are extremely rare.,
Understand that chain mails about people being kidnapped are almost always untrue.,
Remember that you have the choice of not going somewhere alone that makes you feel uncomfortable.,
Avoid going to places with people unless someone you trust knows exactly where you are, who you're with, and when you'll be home.,
Stick to areas where there are plenty of people around.,
To boost your sense of security and confidence, always bring your cell phone with you and make sure it's fully charged.,
Always ask someone you trust for help if you're in an uncomfortable situation and/or you feel as if the ""friendly"" guy who let you go ahead of him in the grocery line is stalking you.",How to Overcome a Fear of Being Kidnapped," When your worries are clogging up your mind, throw them out into the open. Chances are, people will give you great advice, and you can feel less worried. Scary dreams and ideas will disappear once you share them out loud with someone you completely trust. You may also find that there are other people who share the same worries as you - together, you all can get through your fear and support each other.;
, Do not convince yourself that you're being targeted at the very moment; otherwise, you're simply making it harder for yourself and allowing your fear to take over you. Know that you are safe in your home.

, Don't trust everything you read on the Internet! However, while the stories may be false, having scary emails forwarded to you can possibly shrink your confidence. To avoid having that happen, change your mail settings so that those messages are automatically deleted - you'll never have to see them in your inbox, and you won't have to worry about manually deleting them.

, However, it doesn't necessarily mean that you can never go to that place again. Instead, overcome your fear by asking someone you trust to help accompany you to those areas where you don't want to be alone (ex: the mall). This will give you a sense of security, and you'll eventually feel confident enough to go out by yourself. Also, get to know clerks and employees in shops that you normally go to. That way, seeing their familiar face will be like a breath of fresh air when you go to those places alone.


Familiarize yourself with the locations of any public phones in the area. Also, get into the habit of bringing extra change with you whenever you go out alone. That way, you'll be able to call the police if trouble strikes, but remember that the chances of you being abducted are extremely low.

, This way, someone will be able to call for help if you're abducted and aren't home by the time you said you would be. Also, letting someone know about your plans will help police and investigators find you even faster than if you mysteriously ""disappeared"" without a single soul knowing where you went off to.


Bring a cell phone with you so that you can stay in touch with the person who knows where you're going.

If you're kidnapped, you could try to call the person's number or the police.



, This will eliminate the possibility of someone hurting you, and it'll make it harder for you to be kidnapped than if you went to quiet areas with almost no one around. Because there are people around, kidnappers don't necessarily want to take the chances of being caught in the middle of abducting you, and they also don't want your screams to alert the people around you. Kidnappers normally prefer to stick to safer, more vulnerable targets. Therefore, if you're not vulnerable and you're not safe for kidnappers to abduct without getting in trouble, you won't have to worry about being kidnapped!

, If you have limited minutes on your cell phone, be sure that you refill those minutes once in a while to ensure that you'll be able to text or call someone if you're in trouble. Also, grab an easily portable object that can possibly be used as a weapon to fend off kidnappers (ex: pepper spray or heavy book). However, make sure that the object you're planning to bring along is legal to avoid getting in trouble with the police.


Examples of an illegal weapon you don't want to have in your possession are guns and knives.
You could also bring a loud whistle along with you so that you can blow it for help when someone tries to attack or kidnap you. However, it's recommended that you scream instead, for some people might believe it's just a little kid playing around with a loud whistle.

, Do not convince yourself that the situation isn't what it appears to be and that you're just imagining it. Although you might be afraid of embarrassing yourself and being scared over nothing, ignore that feeling if it's obvious that you're being stalked and provide for your own safety first before tending to your self pride. It's always wise to handle the situation and eliminate the possibility of being kidnapped while you have the chance before the kidnapping actually takes place.

If all else fails, take responsibility for yourself.",How to Deal With Your Ride Not Showing Up,"

If your ride happens to show up when you're not there, they could think that something bad happened to you. To avoid mishaps like this, calmly gather your things (if you have any) and wait for a few minutes. Maybe they are just running late, or you got done with practice early.;
,

If you own a cell phone, now is the time to use it. Call or text the person who was supposed to pick you up.
If you don't own a cellphone, you will have to try to find one. You could walk to a nearby restaurant or gas station, as long as it is safe to do so.
Once you have a phone, it is ideal to contact the person who was supposed to pick you up. If they answer, ask where they are or if they are still planning to give you a ride. At this point you can usually figure something out. Do not get upset with them if they forgot; try to be understanding.
If they don't answer, try calling someone else you know well and trust, such as a parent, friend, or neighbor. Maybe they'll be willing to give you a ride or help you contact someone who can give you one.

,

Is there anyone left that you know and trust that could help you contact your ride? If there is, you could try getting their attention before they drive off.
Even if there isn't someone there you know well, you could always ask to borrow a stranger's cell phone. Just remember to be respectful and most importantly safe.

,

Determine a reasonable time (say, 15-20 minutes) after you were supposed to be picked up. If you weren't able to contact anyone, and you still haven't seen your ride show up, you could always walk home as long as it's safe and practical to do so.
If you see a police officer, security guard, fireman, or any other official, know that it's perfectly fine to ask them for a ride home. They will understand, and you know that you can trust them.
Especially if it has been a while, and you can't walk home or contact anyone for a ride, or it's getting dark outside, go to the nearest public building and explain your situation to an employee. They will help you find someone to take you home, whether it's your parents or a cop.

Teens need breakfast for several reasons. It helps provide the energy needed to concentrate and pay attention in school and helps keep weight in check. In addition, studies have shown that teens who eat breakfast do better academically compared to those who don't.Although it may be a great idea to have your teen prepare their own breakfasts each morning, that might not be realistic. Help your teen get in this important meal by making breakfast yourself (especially if they're unwilling).
Always include a source of lean protein and some carbohydrates to give your teen a source of long-term energy.You can make a smoothie with fruit and greek yogurt, make a scrambled egg sandwich on a whole wheat english muffin or a bowl of oatmeal with fruit or greek yogurt with fruit.;
, Even if you want your teen to take charge of making their own nutrition decisions, you're still the adult who is most likely in charge of bringing home food for the week. Stock your pantry and refrigerator with nutritious foods to help provide those options for your teen.


When you're grocery shopping, think about how you can stock your home with the right types of foods for your teen and family. Choose items that are not only nutritious but also something your teen enjoys.
Have easy-to-grab or prepare snack foods for your teen. When your teen gets home from school or sports practice he or she may be feeling a little hungry. Having ready-to-eat foods can help your teen grab something nutritious without thinking twice.
Stock up on items like: cheese sticks, fruit, pre-cut vegetables (or you can cut these yourself) and dip, whole grain crackers, hummus, individual yogurts or 100% whole grain granola bars.

, When you're making meals for your family, its important to serve nutritious foods like lean protein. This helps your teen understand this is an important part of a meal and a nutritious choice.


Lean protein will provide your teen with the energy needed during the day but also the fuel to promote proper growth and development.Teens need very similar amounts of protein as adults. Making sure your teen chooses a lean protein at each meal and snack will ensure they're getting enough. When serving dinner or other meals, make sure you provide a 3 – 4 oz serving (about the size of a deck of cards) of lean protein.
Lean protein is a great choice as it's lower in unhealthy fats, calories while being a great source of protein.Choose items like: poultry, eggs, lean beef, pork, seafood, eggs and low-fat dairy.

, Other important food groups to include at each meal and snack are fruits and vegetables. This is where your teen may be lacking the most and will benefit from you preparing and serving these foods often.


Fruits and vegetables are the biggest sources of vitamins and antioxidants in anyone's diet. They're also a really great source of fiber.Serving a portion of vegetables and fruit with every meal and snack will help you and your teen get in the recommended five servings daily. Measure out 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of salad greens or 1/2 cup of fruit per serving., Grains are an important food group for teens — they'll help provide them with energy and a source of fiber.Encourage your teen to choose these nutrient-dense grains whenever possible.


Although adults may choose to avoid grains for the sake of weight loss, teens need to include grains regularly to help provide adequate energy for daily fuel.
Serve your teen 100% whole grains. These grains are minimally processed, contain higher amounts of fiber and minerals compared to refined grains like white flour or white rice.Measure out a 1/2 cup or about 1 oz of whole grains per serving.Choose grains like: oatmeal, brown rice, millet, farro, quinoa or whole wheat bread.

, Even if your child has an overall healthy diet, it's still important to make sure they're meeting all of their nutritional needs. You may want to consider giving your teen a vitamin supplement to ensure they're meeting their needs.


Always talk to your child's doctor or pediatrician before giving your teen any type of vitamin or mineral supplement. The physician will be able to tell you whether or not it's safe or necessary.
Teens, especially girls, may need additional iron (especially if they've starting menstruating).Calcium, magnesium Vitamin D are other very important nutrients needed for teens as their bodies continue to stock up calcium to build strong and healthy bones.Vitamin D and magnesium are essential to the absorption of calcium, so make sure they are meeting their daily needs.
Typically, a multivitamin will take care of all of the nutrient needs your teen has. If your teen needs additional supplementation, your physician will advise you what to give them.

, The grocery store is a great place for you to go and get your teen interested in healthy foods and a more nutritious diet.Bring your teen with you to the store to get involved in making some of the choices for the meals and snacks you're going to serve during the week. Ask your teen what they want to eat and have them pick out a few items.
Talk to your child about how each meal should have some protein, whole grains and a fruit or vegetable. You can even ask them to pick out the ingredients for an entire meal.
If you typically stock up on some healthy snack foods, ask your teen to pick some of those out as well.

, Another way to get your teen involved in their own health and nutrition is teaching them how to cook. Cooking and prepping meals is an essential skill — they'll need to learn eventually — so start teaching them now.Have your teen hang out with you in the kitchen as you prep dinner. It's a great time to have one-on-one talking sessions and allow your teen to assist you in prepping the meals.
Let your teen prepare some of the meal as well. Maybe they're in charge of making the salad or steaming the broccoli.
Also, if there is a favorite cuisine or favorite dish of your teen, offer to make that together.
Have them pack their own lunches as well. After dinner is cleaned up, show them how convenient it is to pack their lunch the night before so it's ready for them to grab on their way out the door.

, As you may know, the nutrition fact panel and ingredient list is where you'll find out the ""real story"" of what's in a food or packaged item. Showing your teen how to read a food label will be extremely beneficial to his or her overall nutrition knowledge.When you take your teen to the grocery store with you, show them the food labels. Talk about what you find important and why you choose certain foods. For example, show that you choose greek yogurt over plain yogurt because the protein content is much higher
Teach them the basics — there's no need to get over detailed with your teen. Show off the important things on the label. For example, point where the total protein, fiber and serving size are listed.
You can also have them practice with you at the grocery by comparing two different products and choosing the one they think is more nutritious.
Look at the ingredient label as well. Teach them that added sugars go by many different names (over 60! — and there may be more than one kind in a particular item), dangerous trans fats are often written as ""partially hydrogenated oils,"" and that ingredient lists should be fairly short. Also mention that the ingredients are listed in order of quantity — so if the first item listed is a form of sugar, that means sugar is the #1 ingredient in the item. The last item on the list is present in the least amounts.This will be incredibly important if your teen wants to be a vegetarian, has a food allergy or intolerance.

, Teens, unlike younger children, can understand the reason for proper nutrition a little bit better. If you talk about nutrition and the benefits of nutritious foods, you can help your teen better understand why a healthy diet is important.


They most likely won't relate to long-term health consequences (like diabetes or high blood pressure), but you can still teach them about how their food choices will affect their current lifestyle.
Don't lecture to your teen about healthy eating and nutrition. This might turn them off. Talk about the benefits of nutrition in passing and try to relate the benefits of healthy eating directly to your teen.
For example, you can tell them: ""After track practice, it's important to refuel with a nutritious snack like an apple with peanut butter to help replace the energy you spent during practice and build strong muscles. It'll help you perform better at your next competition."" You could also tell them, ""Make sure to eat breakfast today, it'll give you the energy to concentrate on your final exams.""

, If your teen enjoys purchasing school lunches or goes out to meals with friends, give them some easy tips to help them choose better options.


Your teen won't necessarily respond well to ""choose a low-calorie item or a low-fat item."" You need to make nutrition simple and easy to follow.
Tell them to always have a fruit or vegetable at each meal and snack. Suggest grabbing a piece of fruit from the lunch line or asking for a side of green vegetables if they purchase a school lunch.
You can also suggest being more active on the days they choose to eat out or choose a less nutritious food.
Suggest that if a portion is large to bring home leftovers for another meal.

, Although teens typically are ""king"" of doing whatever they want and making their own decisions, it's still important to show them what ""healthy eating"" should be as an adult.Your teen may no longer mimic you as they did when they were younger, but they're still aware of what you do and don't do — including when it comes to mealtimes and food choices.

Show your teen how you should eat instead of only telling them. Show them how to shop for healthy foods at the grocery store, show them that you read food labels and compare items for the most nutritious choice and show them how you plan out a well-balanced meal.
Also show them that you eat a lot of lean protein, fruits and vegetables. And instead of picking more processed snack foods, show them that you typically choose a healthier choice like whole grain crackers and hummus.

, Get your family on board with healthy eating by encouraging everyone to pack their lunch and drink more water. Purchase lunch boxes and water bottles for everyone to bring to work and school.


Encouraging your teen to bring their lunch instead of buying a school lunch can help them stay away from some of the more processed foods or less nutritious foods that are typically offered at school lunches.
Allow family members to pick out a lunch box that they like and will feel happy about bringing with them to school.
The same goes for water. Let your child pick out a fun water bottle they can tote with them to class to help encourage them to drink more hydrating fluids like water.

, Cooking together with just your teen is a great idea; however, it can be even more fun and educational to get your whole family involved in making meals.


Assign everyone a job to do. You teen can make the salad, your spouse can set the table and you can finish up the rest. Getting everyone involved makes it a team effort to put a nutritious meal on the table.
It might also be a good idea to assign everyone a night to make dinner. You could have your teen choose all the ingredients and prepare the meal (maybe with your help).

, Many studies have shown that eating dinner together as a family is incredibly important for your child's overall health. Plan to have as many meals together as you can.


Studies have shown that kids who ate dinner together with their family are 35% less likely to engage in disordered eating patterns, 24% more likely to eat more nutritious foods and 12% less likely to be overweight.It can be difficult finding a night to eat dinner together with sports practices, after school clubs and homework. The weekends are a great time to review your family's schedule and plan in dinner at a time that will work for everyone.
Even if you're forced to grab a bite to eat out at restaurant, go as a family and sit down instead of eating in the car.
The weekends are another great time to eat together. You can do breakfast, lunch or dinner on weekends when everyone is home.

, Don't stop at healthy eating when it comes to teaching your teen about health. It's also important to teach them about an overall healthy lifestyle.


Physical activity is a huge component (in addition to diet) that makes for a healthy lifestyle.

Do activities together as a family. For example, everyone can go for a walk after dinner. Or get involved in a family sport — like going skiing, hiking or kayaking.
Be a good role model when it comes to exercise as well. Show your teen that you know the importance of being active regularly by scheduling physical activity for yourself.

It's important to get a parent or guardian to help make your doctor's appointment and ask what's safe if there are additional resources and support.


Make an appointment with your doctor or pediatrician if you still see one. Talk to them about your desired amount of weight loss and ask how you can go about weight loss safely and appropriately.
Also ask if your doctor has any information on additional support from people like: a registered dietitian, exercise physiologist, therapist or young adults weight loss programs.

, Before starting to lose weight, you should set some realistic goals and expectations for yourself. This will help make sure that your goals are achievable.


Typically, it's only recommended to lose about 1 – 2 pounds per week. This usually results from a combination of smaller portions and increased physical activity.Aiming to lose more weight than this is considered unsafe.

Or try https://www.supertracker.usda.gov/, a free website and app that provides a food and activity tracker and a weight manager. Or you can use a pen and paper journal you keep with you.
Take notes on all the foods you eat throughout the day. Also chart a few days at a time to start with. Make sure to write down your breakfast, lunch and dinner meals plus any drinks, snacks or nibbles you eat throughout the day. Even the nibbles count!
Review a few days of your food journal and see where there are some areas where you can make changes to your diet. For example, look out for: skipping meals, consumption of a lot of sweetened beverages or snacking at night.
Keep your food journal as you attempt to lose weight. Tracking your foods can help keep you on track long-term., Its very important to eat at least three meals daily and ensure you're eating regularly throughout the day. This is especially true for teenagers that need food to fuel them throughout the school day.


Make sure to plan out to have breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday. In addition, you may need to have an afternoon snack.
Never skip meals or eat meals that are too small. If you skip meals you run the risk of being low on nutrients, increased hunger and be more tempted to overeat or snack later on the in the day.Make sure to pack your lunch and afternoon snack or bring money to purchase a school lunch or snack during the week. Consider asking your parents to help prepare lunches for you or buy paper bags or a lunch box so that you can bring a healthy lunch to school with you.
In addition, studies have shown that teens who skip meals, especially breakfast, end up being overweight compared to those who don't skip meals., Eating smaller portions of every meal can help you lose weight. By cutting down portion sizes, you're cutting out some extra calories in your day.


Aim for about 1 to 2 cups per portion. Boys may need a little more than girls do when it comes to portion sizes. If you're purchasing food at your school cafeteria or going out with friends, use your fist to help guide measurements. Your fist is about the size of 1 cup. If you're at home, use a food scale or ask your parents to buy a food scale or measuring cups to help you stay on track.
Eating on a smaller plate (lunch vs. dinner plate) has been shown to help people control portion size. In studies, people that were provided a larger plate ate significantly more calories compared to people provided a smaller plate.
Also, aim to stop when you're satisfied, not full. This is your body's natural portion control tool. You shouldn't feel physically full or have any stretching sensation in your stomach.Try to eat slowly and take your time. This can help you feel more satisfied with less food during your meal., Protein is an essential nutrient for teens. It can help manage hunger, fuel you through your day and support healthy growth and development.Include a source of lean protein at each meal. Make sure to measure your portions as well. One serving is about 3 – 4 oz or about the size of your palm.Lean proteins are lower in calories. Try items like: poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, lean pork, seafood, beans, nuts, and tofu.
When you eat adequate protein throughout the day, it helps you manage your overall hunger.

, In addition to protein, fill up on lots of fruits and vegetables. These food groups are a great addition to a weight loss diet.


Fruits and vegetables are low in calories, but high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Measure out 1/2 cup of fruit, 1 cup of vegetables or 2 cups of salad greens.If you aim to include five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables, you'll need to include at least one serving at each meal or snack. This is a great idea, as these foods can bulk up your meals without adding very many calories. You'll feel more satisfied with fewer calories.

, In addition to both fruits and vegetables, you can increase your fiber intake by adding in the occasional whole grain item.


Although the majority of your meals should be lean protein, fruits and/or vegetables, including the occasional serving of whole grains is OK. Stick to the appropriate portion size of about 1/2 cup or 1 oz.Fiber, from fruits, vegetables and whole grains, is filling and satisfying. If you have a higher protein and higher fiber diet, you'll have an easier time managing your overall hunger during the day.Whole grains to try include: quinoa, oatmeal, brown rice, whole wheat bread and tortillas/wraps and whole wheat pasta. Try to stay away from refined grains like white rice, white bread or plain pasta.

, As a teen, you may need to add in a snack to your daily meal plan. This is especially true if you're done with school in the afternoon, but won't have dinner til 6 or 7 pm.


If you need to snack during the day, try choose a nutritious, lower-calorie option. Make your snack count as a great extra shot of nutritious fuel.
Try to include some lean protein and a fruit or vegetable. Packing snacks from home or preparing a homemade snack will give you the most flexibility with this. Try: grapes or apple with cheese, celery with some peanut butter, 1/3 cup of homemade trail mix, a low-fat yogurt with fruit or hummus and carrots.
If you only have options at your school snack bar or vending machine, try to pick the best choice that you can. Try: a package of nuts, pretzels, whole grain pita chips, fig cookies or a low-fat granola bar.

, Water is another important part of your weight loss diet. It'll help keep you hydrated and help manage hunger during the day.


Aim for about eight to 10 glasses of water or other sugar-free beverages throughout the day.If you're not a fan of plain water, try flavored water, seltzer water, decaf tea and water with fruit.
If your school allows, carry around a water bottle with you to your classes so you can drink consistently throughout the day.
Sometimes, your body misinterprets thirst for hunger. You may end up eating or snacking when you just needed a few sips of water.

, One hard grouping of foods to pass up are processed foods. These tasty foods are unfortunately high in calories and fat which can lead to weight gain. Try to limit or avoid these foods as much as possible.


Studies have shown that teens who eat fast food on a regular basis or other processed foods (like cakes, cookies, candies or chips) are more likely to be overweight.You do not necessarily have to completely give up these foods, but limit them to once a week or less. It may take you a while to cut these out of your diet, especially if you already eat them regularly. That's okay — just try to keep making slow progress toward your goal.
Foods to be aware of include: fast food, candy, cookies, cakes/pies, chips, crackers, fried foods, sweetened beverages and some vending machine foods.
If you or your friends go out to eat or typically eat some of these foods together, try making healthier choices when possible. For example, instead of a double hamburger and fries at a fast food place, go for a grilled chicken sandwich with apple slices. You can still go and enjoy your friends company, but with a better food option.

, Many teens (especially those with a driver's license) enjoy going out for meals or end up eating at friend's houses or at social events. Try to maintain your healthy diet even when you're not controlling everything you eat.


If you're going out to eat with friends, try to stick to healthier options. Always go for grilled protein over fried and also get a serving of vegetables or a side salad to help increase your vegetable intake. Also try to limit meals with a lot of sauces, gravies or cheese to help limit overall calories.
If you're going over to a friends house, tell your friend or their family about your new eating pattern and ask what they have available or if they're willing to make a healthy option for you. In addition, you can always offer to cook something at home with your family and bring it over to share.
If you're going to a social event, again, stick to the basics of healthy eating. Try to stick to lean proteins without a lot of high fat sauces, fruits and vegetables. If you're going to a party, consider bringing something that's healthy that you'd eat instead of waiting to see what's served.
If you're completely stuck and there's not a healthy thing in sight, don't worry. Eat a small portion of whatever is served. Being super careful with portions can still help prevent you from completely blowing your calories for the day.

, Teens need to participate in a significant amount of physical activity everyday. This helps promote a healthy weight and a healthy body.Aerobic activity can include large variety of exercises. It doesn't necessarily mean you need to go for an hour jog. You can try: walking, hiking, dancing, skateboarding, jumping rope, or riding your bike. Even walking through the mall as you shop counts as activity!
If you're interested in using a gym or fitness center, bring your student ID. You might get a discount on gym classes or memberships.
If you're not comfortable working out at the gym or outside, consider purchasing exercise DVDs, watching exercise videos online or on your tablet.

, Another way to get in some extra activity in your day, is by signing up for physical education or PE classes each semester.


Many schools only require one semester or one year of PE classes; however, you can choose to continue to take them if you desire. When you're signing up for your classes, always include a PE class.
PE is a great way to get in activity. Plus, you have the help and coaching of your PE teacher, get to learn new and fun ways to be active and are being active in a group setting.

, Another way to get more active is to consider joining a club or intramural sport.


Many schools offer sports teams outside junior varsity and varsity sports programs. It's usually less competitive and allows for all fitness levels.
Doing one of these sports clubs can be a fun way to get in activity. You're playing a sport, hanging out with friends and have a great support group to keep you going.
Plus, many of these teams will have practices throughout the week so you'll be active more often.

, Losing weight, especially large quantities as a teenager, can be a really difficult task mentally and emotionally. Prepare yourself for success by building a support group.


Ask your family to make some of your healthy diet and lifestyle changes with you. They'll be a great support group and it's easier to make these changes if everyone is on board at home.Talk to your friends as well. They may also want to lose some weight or get active. You can take PE classes together, play a club sport together, go for walks together or choose healthier restaurants together.

, In addition to friends and family, you may want to consider seeing a therapist or a school counselor for extra support and guidance.


These mental and emotional health experts will be able to provide you with support, motivation and tips on navigating through your weight loss journey.
They'll also be able to help you deal with any stress or emotional eating and give you tips and suggestions for changing those behaviors.
If you are being bullied or having a difficult time at school, address this with your school counselor. You should never feel bullied at school, feel uncomfortable or hurt during school.

, Getting adequate rest each night is important to your weight loss. If you're not sleeping enough it's tough to stay motivated and focused.


Many teens stay up late, but still have to get up early for school. When you wake up tired and groggy the next day, you're more likely to skip your workouts, eat bigger portions or eat more processed foods.Also, when you don't sleep well, your body produces more hormones that make you feel hungrier throughout the day. This makes it difficult to stick to small portions or give up snacking.
Aim for at least eight or nine hours of sleep each night. Go to bed earlier so that you can get in those important sleep hours before school starts the next day.

Avoid searching for an intruder.,
Come up with a simple code word that your family will recognize in an emergency.,
Designate a safe room.,
Make sure your safe room locks from the inside.,
Have your safe room stocked in advance.,
Turn out the lights and remain as silent as possible.,
Avoid calling out to the intruder.,
Call emergency services as quickly as possible.,
Choose your position in the safe room strategically.,
Remain in your safe room until the police arrive.,
Make sure your entire house is checked by the police.,
Consider staying with a friend or neighbor for the rest of the evening.",How to Deal With an Intruder in Your Home1," We've all seen movies where the home-owner grabs a bat and sneaks through the house searching for an intruder. It's best, though, to avoid confrontation with the intruder if at all possible.


An intruder can react violently, so instead of searching for the intruder, you should first try to escape or hide.;
, If you need to warn your family members about an invasion, it's a great idea to have a code worked out in advance.


You can shout this simple word or phrase, such as “ESCAPE!”, to put them on the alert so that they can escape or run to a safe place.

, If you're not able to get out of the house, having a designated safe room (or even closet) can be a good idea.


If at all possible, try to make your way to this safe room if you hear an intruder in your home.

, Whether your safe room is your bedroom or a separate room in the house, you want to make sure that it has a solid door which locks from the inside and which can be quickly and easily barricaded.


Consider installing a dead bolt on your bedroom door and/or the safe room for extra security., The most important item to have in your safe room is a working, charged phone so that you can contact the police. Ideally, this will not be a land-line, which could be cut, and would instead be a cell phone.


Stock your safe room with things you can use as a weapon in case the intruder makes it in and you are forced to defend yourself, such as a bat. We'll have more to say in later steps about keeping more dangerous weapons such as knives and guns in your safe room.
You may also want to consider having food, water, and first aid supplies in your safe room., You don't want to alert the intruder to your presence if at all possible, so make sure that all lights in the room are turned off.

, You may be tempted to yell “We've called the police!” in order to make the intruder panic and leave as quickly as possible. This isn't a good idea, though—it will give away your hiding place.If, however, the intruder tries to break into the room where you're hiding, then it may actually be a good idea to yell “We've called police—they're on their way!”.
Use the plural “we” when you call out, even if you're alone. If the intruder thinks that there are more than one of you, he may panic and leave.

, Once you are secure, call for help immediately. Be sure to provide the dispatcher with as many details as possible.For example, “My name is Sally Smith, and I live at 123 River Road. I hear two intruders in my home. I'm hiding in the upstairs back bedroom, and I think they are still downstairs in the living room.”
Try to keep the line with the dispatcher open so that they can listen in, provide you with updates on the progress of the police, and help keep you calm.

, If the intruder tries to break into the room where you are hiding, you're going to have to be prepared. Experts recommend that you stand in a corner that is on the opposite side of the door. Have your family members stand behind you.


This way, if the intruder breaks into the room, you'll be able to see them before they see you, and you can quickly assess the situation to see if you need to fight (or shoot, if you are armed with a gun).

, Even if you are sure that the intruder has left, it's best for you to stay put until the police arrive to secure your home.


Continue to stay on the line with the emergency services dispatcher until you are told that the police have arrived and until the police announce themselves outside your door.

, Especially if the suspect isn't caught by the police, you should ask them to thoroughly check your house and property.

, Even if the police have assured you that your house is safe, you may feel more comfortable spending the night elsewhere.


It's also a good idea to try to determine how the intruder got into your home: was a lock picked or a window broken? You may need to have repairs completed and/or locks changed before you'll feel safe sleeping in your home again.

Break in through an open window.,
Borrow a screwdriver from a neighbor.,
Remove the window beading.,
Pry open the window pane from the bottom.,
Remove the window pane.",How to Break Into Your House1," First floor windows will be easiest and safest, but these are also the most likely to be locked. You’ll have better chances of finding a second floor window left open, but exercise caution - you don't want to fall!If a ladder isn’t available, you may have to get creative to reach a second storey window. Is there a fire escape you could climb? A trellis? A tree? Whatever you use, make sure it’s stable before climbing.Casement windows (side-hinged windows) may be easy to pry open with your fingers or a thin tool if they aren't locked.;
, You don’t have to feel shy or embarrassed. Most everyone has an “I locked myself out” story, so they’ll likely understand your predicament.


A flathead screwdriver will work best, but if you’re handed a Phillips head (cross slot) screwdriver, give it a shot anyway.
This technique can be effective for removing or partially prying open door windows. Even a small gap may allow you to reach inside and open the lock.

, The beading is the plastic or metal strip around the window frame. Insert your screwdriver into the beading channel at one corner and pry it out a little bit at a time. Work your way to the opposite corner. When the beading has been completely loosened, pull it free with your hands.

Check the corner of the window to see whether the vertical (up and down) beading overlaps the horizontal (left and right). Remove the overlapping beading first.
Removing the beading may deform it. In some cases, beading can be quite expensive. Keep this in mind before attempting entry in this way.
Depending your situation, you may be able to leave the beading in place and still lever the window free. Some windows may not even have beading., Insert your screwdriver between the glass and frame. When prying, use light force while working your tool in between the mounting and glass to lever the glass out of its mounting. The window should come out relatively easily., Support the glass with your free hand so it doesn’t fall and shatter when it comes free. Slide the glass free of its mounting, place it off to the side, and enter your house through the empty window.If your window has only partially popped free of the mounting, try to reach either a set of keys, the lock, or the door handle.
If there's any broken glass, be incredibly careful. Jagged glass may be sharper than you think.
In the event of a deep cut, treat the wound as best you can and see a doctor, if necessary.

Always walk with purpose.,
Wear conservative clothing.,
When you're a teenager, you're usually not considered an unaccompanied minor.,
If it's possible, choose a seat next to a woman.,
Don't ever accept a ride from anyone!",How to Fly Alone Safely As a Teenage Girl," When you are a young girl traveling alone in a big airport, you may seem vulnerable, which makes you an easy target. Walk with intention, and don't act timid or afraid. Figure out how to carry all your bags, read signs in the airport and make sure you know where you're going, and ask for help directly when you need it.;
, A pair of jeans (nothing really form fitting), converse or sneakers, a nice tee shirt, and a sweater or sweatshirt is great. Avoid high heels, short skirts and shorts, really form fitting pants, and don't show any cleavage. Keep your hair neat. The objective is to avoid drawing any unnecessary attention to yourself.

, You should still let the flight attendant on your plane know that you are under 18 and flying alone. They will check up on you and make sure everything's going okay.

, However, this is often not possible. Try to avoid conversations with the people next to you. Put your headphones in as soon as it's permitted and don't take them out. It's okay to exchange a hello and a few words of casual conversation, but if the person next to you starts revealing or asking about personal information, be assertive. Excuse yourself from any conversation politely by reading a book or watching a movie from in-flight entertainment.

, Don't ever let any stranger carry your bags, or anything like that. When your flight is over, get your bags efficiently and locate whoever is going to pick you up.

Set off your car alarm.,
Keep your distance from the intruder.,
Choose a strategic stance.,
Try to cooperate with the intruder.,
Know how to answer the phone if you have an alarm system.",How to Deal With an Intruder in Your Home2," While you probably sleep with your phone next you, you may never have thought of bringing your car keys to bed. If you hear an intruder (either in the house, or in the room with you), press the alarm button for your car. There's a good chance that the intruder will take off., If the intruder makes it in to your room and you're already up, try to stay as far away as possible.


Be on the lookout for ways to escape, and do your best to remain calm and cooperative. You should avoid confrontation and violent reactions if at all possible.

, Place your hands at shoulder level, which the intruder may interpret as being submissive, but which places you in a good position for self-defense., If you can't see an immediate route for escape, it is important to try to remain calm, and it's usually best to cooperate with the intruder.You may eventually be forced to defend yourself, but at least initially, you'll have a greater chance of surviving if you do what you're asked.

, If you haven't been able to call the police before an intruder makes it into your home, and if you have a home alarm system, you may receive a phone call from the company.


If the intruder is in the room and wants or allows you to answer (they may know that if you don't pick up the police will be sent), you should have a distress code phrase prearranged with the security company.
When you say the code words, they'll know that you're in trouble. For example, you could say “Mom, I'll call you in the morning.”"

Decide whether to use pepper-spray.,
Aim to incapacitate.,
Inflict damage with your hands.,
Use your elbows.,
Use common objects as weapons.,
Run as soon as you are able.",How to Deal With an Intruder in Your Home3," You should use pepper-spray on an intruder only if you will be able to escape after doing so.


The fumes can be overwhelming, and you don't want to be trapped in a room with them., While it's generally recommended that you try to escape or cooperate with an intruder, you may be forced to defend yourself.If you need to fight, you should fight to incapacitate the intruder so that you can escape.


Aim for the groin, neck, face (eyes, nose, mouth) or knees.Where you should hit the attacker will depend on where the intruder is positioned near you. If he's not standing right next to you, for example, then try to kick his knees (hard and fast), rather than moving closer to strike him in the neck., Hold your dominant hand open and flat, with your fingers straight and close together, and your thumb out. Then forcefully jab your hand into the intruder's neck.You may also be able to incapacitate the intruder by making a forceful upward thrust with the heel of your palm into his nose., You may also be able to throw your elbow up into the intruder's neck, face, groin, or even stomach.


Use your leverage, and throw your body weight into it., While you can attempt to gouge your attacker's eyes or nose with your hands, scan the room quickly to see if you can use something else as a weapon. For example, it's a good idea to keep a pen or your car keys near your bed.


If you're woken before you can make it to your safe room or grab another more suitable weapon, you may still be able to inflict serious damage with these items.

, While you may be forced into a physical confrontation with the intruder, take the first opportunity to flee. Make as much noise as possible, in the hopes that you'll alert a neighbor or a passerby to your situation.

Learn about the law in your state.,
Shoot if you believe you or a family member are in danger.,
Learn if you're required to try to escape.,
Learn if your state has a “Stand Your Ground” law.,
Learn if “Castle Doctrines” apply in your state.,
Keep your guns in a safe, secure place.,
Store your guns and ammunition separately.,
Consider using a gun lock.,
Identify that there is an intruder before shooting.",How to Deal With an Intruder in Your Home4," You may be conflicted about whether or not it's a good idea to keep a gun in your home, although it is highly advised for your safety. There are of course safety concerns about keeping weapons in a house with children, but you may also be worried about what will happen to you if you shoot an intruder. Do not worry though, for if you do harm said intruder, it is completely within your rights to harm them if you live in a state with the ""Stand Your Ground"" law.


In most cases, the law will protect you if you shoot an intruder., Even though you will generally be protected by the law for shooting an intruder, you generally must reasonably believe that you are in danger, and you must respond proportionately.This means that if the intruder is threatening you with a piece of fruit, for example, and you know it's a piece of fruit, you could face charges for stabbing or shooting the intruder., In some states, you are required to at least attempt to retreat from the dangerous situation before you can legally respond with force., While the law or statute might be called something else, many states have laws which do not require you to retreat (or attempt to). Instead, you are legally permitted to claim self-defense and respond with force.


Even in these states, you aren't allowed to attack without reasonable cause, so be careful. If you can, it helps to research what laws and statutes apply where you live., Generally speaking, if you live in such a state, you're legally permitted to use lethal force upon anyone who unlawfully enters your home, without needing to first determine whether and how much of a threat they pose to you.


Again, it's always a good idea to learn what laws apply in your state, and how the specifics vary., If you do feel more secure with guns in your home, it's important that they are securely locked (ideally in a gun safe) and not just hidden.


This is all the more important if you have children: even if you think that you've hidden your guns and ammunition where they'll never find it, it is nearly guaranteed that they will discover your hiding places., It's generally recommended that you keep the guns in your home unloaded, and that you store your guns and ammunition separately. You should of course be able to access both quickly in an emergency.


Consider storing them in your safe room, but be sure to keep the keys to both where children cannot find them., You can purchase gun-locking devices which will render a gun inoperable when not in use.Make sure that you know how to disable the lock quickly, but know that using one can be a good idea if you have children or teenagers in the home.

, In order to avoid tragic accidents, it's important that you try to keep a cool head when you think there is an intruder in the home. Account for your spouse, partner, and/or other family members before shooting blindly.


While the police should identify themselves if they enter your home, try to take a quick moment before shooting if someone breaks into your room. It could be an intruder, in which case it's important that you protect yourself, but you don't want to accidentally shoot a police officer.

Check the lock.,
Select an unimportant plastic card to open the lock.,
Wedge the card in the space between the door and the frame.,
Locate the lock mechanism with your card.,
Lever the latch with the card to disengage it and open the door.",How to Break Into Your House2," The card technique will only work on a spring latch. Spring latches are generally the kind that move with the handle when it is turned. Turn the handle to make sure that the spring lock is engaged. If it doesn't turn, it's locked.


A dead bolt is often located above or below the handle. If the handle moves but the door doesn’t open, the dead bolt is locked and you'll need to try a different method.This method will be much less likely to work on modern locks, which are designed to be less vulnerable to unlocking with a plastic card.

, When opening a door with a plastic card, the card may be damaged. Because of this, you should avoid using important or frequently used cards, like credit cards. A library card or point card will be less of a big deal to replace.Laminated cards tend to work best. These cards are bendy and can be inserted more easily between the door and its frame.

, Press on the door with moderate force with your non-dominant hand. This will create some extra space between the door and frame, making it easier to insert your card. Work your card into this gap just above the doorknob on a downward angle.If there's molding on the frame, there will be less space between the door and frame, making this process more difficult. In these cases, you may want to try another method to prevent costly damage.

, Your card is wedged between the door and frame, right? Wiggle it deeper into the space between the doorknob and doorjamb until you meet resistance. This is the lock mechanism, which you’ll need to force back to disengage.


Feel around with the bottom corner of your card a little bit. You should feel the angled part of the latch facing towards you.
If the sloped side of the latch isn't facing you, you'll need to slide a long piece of plastic behind the latch to work it from the angled side., Press the card away from the knob to apply greater pressure to the latch. It’s unlikely you’ll be able to completely disengage the latch this way, but when you feel it start to give, push on the door and it should open.This may take a bit of maneuvering. Try different positions until you find one that allows the card the most purchase on the lock mechanism.
Although this won’t be necessary for some latches, it may help open the door if you turn the knob lightly with your free hand disengaging the latch."

Lay hands on tools.,
Remove the knob by unfastening the mounting screws.,
Take off knobs without obvious mounting screws with a paperclip.,
Pop doors off their hinges when possible.,
Jump sliding glass doors off their track to gain access.",How to Break Into Your House3," A lock can be manually disengaged by taking the knob apart, and even quality locks won’t stop you if the door is off its hinges. Doorknobs will require a screwdriver or paperclip; hinges will need a nail and a pounding tool, like a hammer or rock.Borrow these items from a neighbor or snag them from your tool shed. If your car is open, you might have some emergency tools there, too.
The kind of screwdriver you need will depend on the kind of door you have. Knobs and hinges are often fastened with Phillips head (cross slot) screws.
Even if you don’t have a screwdriver available, you may be able to remove fasteners with a suitably thin, sturdy tool, like a butter knife or a bent pin.

, Ideally, you’ll be able to see mounting screws connecting the knob to the door. These can be simply unfastened with your screwdriver to take apart the knob. Pull the knob free of the door, and disengage the latch with your fingers.

Depending on the kind of lock installed in your door, you may be able to disengage the lock immediately after removing the knob, or you may need to remove a secondary mounting plate.
Some knobs may only have a screw fastening the knob to the spindle that both knobs are attached to. To remove these, loosen the screw on the metal connecting the knob to the door., Some knobs may have a pin-size hole in the front of the knob instead of mounting screws. Insert a thin piece of metal, like a straightened paperclip, as deep into the hole as possible while twisting the knob and pushing on the door to open it.

In some situations, you may find that fastening hardware for knobs, like screws and bolts, are only accessible from the inside., The hinges are usually the most vulnerable part of a door, requiring only a nail to bypass. Place a nail (or a similar item) at the bottom of the opening for a hinge pin. Then hit the nail with a tool (like a hammer or rock) to push the pin out. Do this for all hinges.

The hinge pins may be stiff when you remove them, even after they’ve been partially pushed out with a nail. For easier removal, use a screwdriver like a chisel under the rim of the pin head to pop it free.
Much like knobs, doors that are well-installed may not have outside accessible hinge pins. You won’t be able to easily pop the door off its hinges if this is the case for you., Most sliding glass doors, opposed to traditional hinged doors, are not directly fastened to your home's structure. Many rest in a track and are locked in place, and by jumping the door out of the track, you can easily bypass it.

You may be able to jump a light sliding glass door by prying up and outward with a flathead screwdriver (or two), but a prybar or crowbar will work best.
Be careful when trying to get your door to jump its track. If it falls, it could cause expensive damage.
To make sliding doors in your home less vulnerable to break ins, you may want to secure your door with a security bar, like a wooden dowel."
"
Obtain a wire hanger.,
Bend the hanger into a long rod that ends in a hook.,
Insert the rod through the top of your garage.,
Hook the door release latch and yank to disengage it.",How to Break Into Your House4," You may have a spare hanger in your car or in outdoor storage, but if not you’ll have to go door-knocking until you find a pleasant neighbor who can give you one. Really, any piece of sturdy yet moldable wire will do.


Even thin wire, like the kind use in electrical work, can be doubled up for improved stiffness and used to open your garage door., The rod needs to be as long as possible. If you find that the reach of your hanger is insufficient, wrap the non-hook end around an extension, like a branch.


If possible, double up the wire of the coat hanger to make it sturdier. This may only be possible if you have an extra hanger or leftover wire.

, For some garages, this may be impossible. But if your garage has a gap at its top, you should be able to snake in the rod hook-end first.


You may find it easier to insert the rod from the sides, but it’ll need to be in the center of the door to disengage its lock.
Be careful when doing this if there is a soft plastic molding around the door. Inserting your rod between the molding and the door could cause damage it, which can be expensive to replace., The manual release latch is located just below where the arm for the opener attaches to the garage door track. Maneuver the hook around the latch and pull with firm, steady pressure until the latch disengages. Now you can slide the door up and open.Many garage door releases have a string attached so you can pull and disengage the release from inside the garage. Use this string as a point of reference when looking for the release.
If you can't see into your garage, feel along the door's metal track toward the opener motor. When you feel a ridge poking out of the track to the rear of the motor, you’ve found the release.

Contact a friend, family member, or some other key holder.,
Reach out to your landlord.,
Call a locksmith.",How to Break Into Your House5," If you've entrusted a key to a friend, family member, or neighbor, now's the time to retrieve it. If you don't have your phone on you, head to a neighbor to call a key holder to help you out of this bind., This is generally a last resort. Having your landlord come unlock the door oftentimes costs a fee. And that's if they answer the phone. If your landlord isn't answering, or if you can't find their number, this option may lead to a dead end., Locksmiths are trained in techniques and equipped with tools that will, in most cases, help you break into your home without doing any damage. The cost of a locksmith varies widely depending on location, and can range from as low as $15 and as high as $75 (or more, depending on the lock)."

Examine your yard.,
Think about the ages of your children and how many you have.,
Go out into your yard.,
Once you're sure your fencing is safe, it's time to think about deck heights.,
Now it's time for stairs entering and exiting the garden.,
After using these tips, scan your garden (And your list) for anything you have to fix not mentioned here.,
Talk to your child about being safe in the garden.",How to Childproof a Yard," How big is it? Is it safely fenced? Does it have a deck that children could fall off? Make a list of any potential hazards!;
, This is important because depending on how old they are and other factors lists the dangers they might put themselves in.

, Is it fenced in? If it is, could the fence be climbed over or harm your child (Spikes, etc.) If you don't have a fence, go to a store (such as Rona or Home Depot) and buy a safe fence that is preferably flat and of tall/medium height. There are lots of different types of fencing, so if you like that sort of thing, find one that complements your home and garden!

, If you don't have a deck, then you can skip this step. If there is a hole between the deck floor and bench that children could crawl through, fall into the lower garden, and hurt themselves, either put short fencing over the gap so the hole is too small for anyone to climb through, or put boards cardboard, or plastic in front of it so there is no gap showing.

, Children can fall down the stairs and injure themselves, so this is important. Put something relatively soft at the bottom of the stairs, so that if they fall, they won't seriously harm themselves. Make sure they're wearing appropriate footwear. If it's raining, give them rain boots for just a bit of added protection! Remember though, if your child is quite young, you should always make sure you accompany them walking down the stairs.

, Do what feels right, and think in your child's mind.

, Give them the rules and boundaries, and how to be safe. Just telling them lets them know about being safe, and it helps!

Sleep 8-10 hours every night.",How to Get Fit (Teenage Girls)," Almost everyone has at least one sedentary pleasure, be it binge-watching favorite television shows, playing video games, or surfing the internet on your laptop. Not only do these activities often require you to sit or lay prone as you do them, they have also been shown to cause problems with self-esteem and anxiety in children and teenagers.Getting active doesn’t mean you have to quit all of these enjoyable hobbies, though: you can simply reduce the time you dedicate to these activities rather than cutting them out all together.


For example, cap your daily television watching at two hours. You can allow yourself more time as long as you’re watching while jogging on the treadmill, doing yoga, or stretching.
If you waste untold hours of the day on the internet, try installing software on your computer that blocks problem sites and increases productivity, such as Freedom, Anti Social, and StayFocused.You can also give yourself time limits for surfing the web or playing video games. Just make sure that you stick with them.;
, It’s always nice to have popcorn while you snuggle up on the sofa for movie night, and there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a snack some times. The problem is that you probably snack a lot more often—and with foods much unhealthier than popcorn—than these movie nights. Many people snack almost constantly and don’t realize it until they specifically look for the behavior. When you’re making a diet plan, allow yourself one or two snacks a day and refuse additional snacks when offered to you by others.Choose healthier snacks such as popcorn made without a lot of oil, salt, or butter, or fruits or veggies and a low-calorie dip.
Salty and sweet junk foods like chips and soda are particularly addictive, so you might want to keep them out of the house altogether. Ask your parents and family members for help avoiding these delicious but unfulfilling snacks in the household.

, Modern society often encourages lazy behaviors in ways one doesn’t even realize, such as offering escalators in malls, making automotive vehicles the default mode of transport in daily life, and emphasizing convenience through mobile applications, delivery services, and virtual socializing. You can opt out of lots of these behaviors, though, by substituting them with active pursuits.


For example, ditch the car next time you need groceries and walk to the store. This might not be an option if you live in a rural or suburban area, but you can do other things like walking between shops when in town instead of driving.Next time you’re about to hop on an elevator or the automated walkway at the airport, think again! Go the old-fashioned way and take the stairs or non-automated path.

, Your go-to activity when meeting up with friends might be sharing some apps at the local diner or gabbing on the couch, but you don’t have to limit your social hour to sedentary activities. Next time you’ve set a date to catch up with your pals, go to a nature trail or neighborhood path and take a walk together rather than slouching on the sofa, or play an active video game like WiiFit instead of your usual fare.If your friends aren’t into the idea, ask family members if they’d like to go for a walk next time you’re sitting around talking or watching television, or ask your parents if you can join a walking meet-up group where you can meet new friends with whom to be active. Or, make plans at the skating rink, skateboard park, or at the pool.

, Smoking can cause lots of health problems and it can also affect your ability to be physically active. For example, you might find vigorous cardiovascular activities like running, swimming, and dancing are much harder if you are a smoker. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about how to quit. There may be smoking cessation programs in your area that can help., Regular, well-rounded exercise will benefit you more than sporadic workouts which include only one type of exercise like weight-lifting or running. You should incorporate both aerobic exercise—any activity that uses large muscle groups and can be sustained for at least ten minutes—and strength-conditioning—resistance-based activities which strengthen your muscles through repetition—into your fitness regimen, with aerobic activities taking up more time than strength-training.You can make sure you perform the recommended balance of activities by establishing a workout calendar.


Make sure you plan your workouts around other, mandatory aspects of your life such as school, work, and family. While fitness is important, it’s only one pillar of your life and shouldn’t cause you to sacrifice other things., Concerted aerobic exercise enhances your cardiovascular health and endurance while releasing endorphins and elevating your mood. Aim for a minimum of 150 minutes per week, or 30 minutes a day five times a week.You can join a gym to take advantage of aerobics classes and workout machines, or you can go for a more independent approach and take up jogging, walking, or cycling.


Though recent studies have cast some doubt on the axiom that stretching before exercise reduces your chances of injury, it’s not a bad idea to do some light, five-minute stretching before you go for a jog. You’ll increase your flexibility over time and feel looser during your aerobic exercise., In addition to your weekly 150-minute commitment to aerobic exercise, you should complete strengthening exercises at least two days a week. Weight machines, medicine balls, resistance bands, and home workouts—for example, push ups and sit ups—all make great strength training activities., Many people make the mistake of doing weight-lifting and other strengthening exercises which only address one part of their body: they’ll do a bunch of arm reps, for example, but ignore their core and legs. Avoid this mistake by making sure you do a mixture of exercises which address all three main muscle groups.In order to strengthen your core, do exercises such as sit ups, plank exercises, and crunches. These will strengthen and tone your abdominal and back muscles.
For your legs, you should do things like squats, vertical jumps, and wall sits. Good arm exercises include pushups, pullups, and lifting dumbbells.

, If you have a difficult time getting and staying motivated during individual workouts, consider joining a sports team. Sports are a fun way to get aerobic exercise and strength training while building strong relationships with other teammates, learning time management, and developing a sense of personal responsibility.If you don’t know what sports you like or would be interested in trying, check out the offerings at your local YMCA and school groups. Feel free to try out several sports and continue only those which you enjoy and find rewarding.

, Team sports aren’t the only way to get active outside of the gym or jogging trail. You can also sign up for classes which teach you a physical activity, such as ballet, yoga, and modern dance are all great examples. See if there’s a yoga or dance studio in your area and then ask your parents if you can afford the monthly fees. Communities often have lower-cost options at local schools, rec departments, gyms, YMCAs, or community centers.


If you’re interested in yoga, make sure you register for a beginner’s class where they’ll provide sufficient instruction. If you try doing moves which are too sophisticated for your level, you can hurt yourself seriously., Fruits and vegetables should comprise the biggest portion of your daily diet, but don’t just eat the same two veggies in large quantities. Studies have shown the healthiest way to get your daily five to nine servings of fruits and veg is to eat a wide variety of them.If you’re not used to eating lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, five portions a day might seem like a lot. You can make this new dietary regimen more manageable and appealing by getting creative with your meals. Mix up new, interesting salads with varied ingredients rather than sticking with a boring, lettuce-tomato-cucumber salad, and try veggie-based alternatives such as veggie burgers and cauliflower-crust pizza., In addition to your daily fruit and vegetable intake, you should make an effort to eat plenty of protein. Try to be a bit picky about your proteins, though: go for lean and unprocessed meats such as lean steak and chicken breast rather than regular grade ground beef (containing 75-85% fat), bacon, and sausages.If you’re a vegetarian, you can still get your daily intake of protein through foods such as nuts, beans, and eggs.

, Recent studies have shown that emphasizing calorie-counting does little to enhance a healthy diet and can lead to disordered eating habits. After all, if you’re just trying to stay under a prescribed calorie mark, it won’t matter if the foods you eat are largely homogenous and supply minimal nutrition, as long as you duck under your 1,200- or 1,500-calorie goal. Instead, prioritize eating three nutritious, well-rounded meals with high-quality ingredients while keeping non-fruit or veggie snacking to a minimum.In the same way, avoid diet and low-fat processed foods such as soda, crackers, yogurt, milk, and cheese. Studies have shown that these artificial, reduced-calorie versions have less nutritional benefits than their whole-fat counterparts, and even that they’re less filling, making it more likely that you’ll eat more of them than you would the non-diet kind., Teenagers— and girls in particular—are prone to iron and calcium deficiencies, so you should be sure to eat foods rich in these nutrients every day. Dairy products such as yogurt and cheese are high in calcium, a nutrient necessary for bone health and growth, and you should aim to get at least 1,300 milligrams a day. Lean meats, fish, soy, and lentils are some foods particularly high in iron, a nutrient which helps deliver oxygen to your body. You should aim for between 15-25 mg of iron per day.It’s important to try to get your daily calcium and iron through foods rather than multivitamins and dietary supplements. Studies have shown that your body absorbs little to none of the nutrients contained in these supplements, so, avoid these supplements unless your doctor advises otherwise., In addition to eating plenty of healthy, un-processed foods, you should also reduce your intake of processed junk foods such as chips, crackers, fast food, candy, and soda. Such foods often contain harmful chemical additives and preservatives, as well as transfats which raise your cholesterol and increase your risk of heart disease.Even though you should try to keep your junk food consumption limited, don’t go overboard and start thinking of these foods as “bad,” “naughty,” or “dirty.” If you start assigning moral value to different foods, you risk developing disordered eating habits in the future and problems with self-esteem., It can feel impossible to eat breakfast when you’re running out the door every morning to catch the school bus or your car pool, but you should make a special effort to incorporate breakfast into your daily routine. This simple step to fitness encourages healthier eating throughout the day, as well as boosting your metabolism and mood.If you just can’t force anything down your throat before you leave for school, take some yogurt and a banana or an omelet in a to-go container with you to school so that you can eat it a bit later in the morning.

, You’ve probably heard your doctor or other health professionals talk about how important hydration is for your health, but you might not realize all the things this miracle of moisture does for you. In addition to flushing toxins out of your organs and delivering nutrients to your cells, water also improves your skin, hair, and nail health.Taking a water bottle to school will help you to sip water throughout the day rather than relying on sporadic trips to the drinking fountain or purchases from the vending machine.
All fluids contribute to your daily water intake—that is, if you drink a twelve-ounce can of orange juice, it counts as twelve ounces toward your two-liter goal. That being said, try to consume most of your two liters through pure or sparkling water, as other drinks such as soda, juice, and iced tea often contain high levels of sugar.

, In a cultural climate that reveres fitness and specific body types, working out can quickly become destructive obsessions. Becoming too preoccupied with your workout regimen can cause injuries from over-exertion, as well as corrode mental health. By giving yourself rest days when you don’t work out and avoiding daily weigh-ins and weight loss shows like The Biggest Loser, you can take steps to ensure that attending to your body doesn’t jeopardize your mental health.If you find yourself feeling guilty or anxious when you don’t work out for a day or two, chances are that you’re developing an unhealthy attitude toward exercise. Talk to a parent or school counselor immediately to get help before your problem worsens.

, Eating healthy and getting fit doesn’t mean that you should deprive yourself of food or that you shouldn’t enjoy your meals. The minute you start perceiving food as something to avoid, you start to develop a problematic relationship with food which can last throughout your whole life. Remind yourself that food is essential to life and let yourself indulge in favorite, rich foods often enough that you don’t develop cravings and the impulse to binge.If you find yourself engaging in habits such as binging, skipping meals, and using laxatives, you are at risk for developing an eating disorder. Contact a parent, school health official, or doctor in order to address the issue., If you devote all your time outside of school to working out and attending to your diet, you’re making your self-esteem dependent on fitness. Your latest workout and meal plan shouldn’t define your failures and successes, though; rather, your whole personality, talents, empathy, and relationships with friends and family are what should make you feel good about yourself. Remind yourself of this fact by dedicating plenty of time to activities such as volunteering for local charity organizations, playing an instrument, writing, or painting.You can help your friends build self-esteem as well by participating in these activities with them and discouraging any self-deprecating comments when you’re around. For example, if a friend says, “Ew, I’m disgusting, I need to work out more,” you should say, “Hey, you’re talking about my friend! I don’t tolerate people talking badly about my friends, no matter who’s speaking!”

, Many teenagers don’t get the proper amount of sleep, and, while you may not notice any adverse effects from this deficiency, lack of sleep can affect your life in many ways. It can make you moody, stressed, and less proficient in class, as well as encouraging poor, impulsive eating habits and even leading to facial blemishes.In addition to striving for an eight-hour minimum, you should aim for a regular sleep pattern. For example, try to go to bed at a similar time each night and avoid sleeping late on the weekends.

Pay attention to warning signs.",How to Be Safe When Home Alone (Kids)," Your parents want you to stay safe. That's why they have rules. If you're not sure what the rules are, sit down with your parents and write out a list together, so you both have something to refer to.The rules might cover who you can have over (if anyone), whether you can go outside, and whether you can take phone calls.;
, While break-ins are unusual, they can happen. The best thing you can do is keep the doors and windows locked when you're inside. That way, someone can't just walk in without your permission.If your family has an alarm, learn how to set it so it can protect you while you're home.

, If someone comes to the door, it's best to ignore it if you don't know the person. If the person is delivering a package, ask them to leave it or come back later. Don't tell them you're by yourself.It's also important not to tell people over the phone that you're by yourself at home. If someone calls for your parents, you can say, ""They can't come to the phone right now. Can I have them call you back?""

, Even though you're home alone, you don't have free rein to do anything you want. You still need to stay away from dangerous things. Don't play with matches, knives, or guns, for instance. Also, don't take medications unless you know what you're doing. Don't mix chemicals and cleaners you find around the house, as it can create fumes or liquids that can hurt you., If something happens or you don't know what to do, call your parents or another trusted adult. They can walk you through the situation so you feel safe again.

It's best to know your parents' cellphone numbers by heart, so you'll always be able to call even if you can't see the list of emergency numbers.

, If something happens, you need to be ready. The main emergency number you need to know is 9-1-1 (in the United States). They can help with emergencies like fires, someone breaking in, or injuries. But you should only call them when it's truly an emergency. If you get a small cut, that's not a reason to call 9-1-1.Keep other emergency numbers on hand, such as your parents' numbers, as well as other people you can call if you have an issue, such as a neighbor or family member.
If you don't have these numbers handy, ask your parents to make a list and post it up for you to see easily., When you call 9-1-1, the operator will want to know a few things. They'll want to know where you are (your address) and what's wrong. They'll also want to know your phone number so they can call back if needed. Try running through a practice call with your parents., If something crazy happens, you may want to panic. Most people do. It's important to stay calm, though. One way you can learn to stay calm is to go over what to do when things happen with your parents.Things can go wrong in a house, such as a toilet overflowing, the smoke alarm going off, or something catching on fire in the kitchen. Ask your parents to go over potential problems with you.

, You need to be able to know how to get out of your house in different ways. Of course, the back and front doors are good options. If there's a fire, though, you may need to escape through a window to get to safety.Ask your parents to go over the best ways out of the house.

, If you're at home alone, you need to know how to deal with getting a cut or a burn. If you have a bad cut or burn, you can call 9-1-1, but if you're only a little hurt, you can fix it yourself.For instance, for a cut, wash your hands, then hold a clean cloth against it to stop the bleeding. Rinse out the cut with cool water. Use antibiotic ointment, and then put a bandaid over it.For a bruise, prop the area up on a pillow. Apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel to help ease the swelling. Don't keep ice on it for more than 10 minutes.With a light burn, put it in cool, running water for about 10 minutes. Don't use ice. When it feels a little better, you can use aloe vera gel on it.Ask your parents where your first aid kit is. If your home doesn't have one yet, buy one, or put one together with your parents.

, If you come home and you see something not right, don't go in the house. A broken window could mean someone is inside. It's better to stay safe. Go to a neighbor or friend's house and call 9-1-1. You can even go back to school if you need to., Even if you know an adult who's knocking on the door, you don't have to let them in if it doesn't feel right. Sometimes, even adults you know may not have good intentions. Trust your gut, and call your parents if you're not sure.Some families have code words, so if your parents send someone to help that you don't know, you'll know it's okay. Then you can ask for the code word if someone says your parents sent them.

, Of course, many houses make odd noises from time to time, usually because the house is settling. However, if you hear a noise that's out of the ordinary, you should check it out. If you notice signs of trouble, take action.

For instance, if you notice signs of someone breaking in, get out of the house if you can and run to a neighbor's for safety.

, Your home is likely equipped with both smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors. When these go off, don't ignore them. If you don't know what to do, it's best to get out of the house, and dial 9-1-1 at a neighbor's house.If you notice that something is smoking, it's likely time to call 9-1-1 so the fire department can help you. You can try to work a fire extinguisher if your parents have shown you how to use one. However, if the fire is more than a very small one, get out of the house.
Also, if your house has a gas stove or heater, always pay attention to gas smells. The carbon monoxide detector should warn you, but it's always best to get out of the house if you smell gas. Natural gas has an additive to make it smell like rotten eggs.

Keep it in a safe place, such as your wallet or an inner pocket in your backpack, and make sure you have it at all times. You don't want to get locked out of the house on a day when your parents won't be back until late.


Make sure the key is with you, not under your doormat or behind a rock. Keys hidden outside your house can pose a danger if a stranger found it - you don't want to risk the chance of your house getting robbed.
Avoid clipping the key to a keychain outside your backpack or on a piece of jewelry - this makes it easy for someone to grab it, or for you to lose it.
Some houses have a security alarm built in, in addition to your key. Typically, these go off whenever there's an ""opening"" in the house (i.e. when a window or door is opened). If your house has one of these systems, make sure you know the code to disarm it, as well.;
, If you have a cell phone, you might be confused on why you need a list of phone numbers when you can simply select them from your contact list. However, if you should ever be unable to use your cell phone (for example, the battery dies), or if you just don't have a cell phone at all, you don't want to realize you can't remember the number to call your dad at work. Put the list somewhere important, preferably where you keep your key.


As a general rule, you'll want to have the phone number of your parents (both cell and work numbers), trusted neighbors, and outside family in the area (e.g. grandparents, aunts and uncles). For the number of parents you have, you should have an extra contact - for example, if you have your mom, your dad, and your stepmom, you should have at least three other contacts that aren't those parents.

, Sometimes, you'll need money to do something important; maybe you need to take public transport to get home, and you need bus funds. Or maybe you took the wrong bus by accident and get lost, and need to take a taxi to get home. Sometimes, you may even need to use a payphone. Make sure to have a good amount of money on you - the amount will probably be dependent on where you live - and make sure that if you ever use the money, you replace the amount that you used.


Keep your money in quarters. Bills may seem more convenient, but you often can't use bills for things like a payphone, and you don't want to overpay a bus fare.
Don't keep too much money on you. Twenty dollars should be fine at home, but outside of the home, you may not want to carry more than five. Ask your parents for their opinion on how much money you should have with you.

, If you have siblings who get out of school at the same time that you do, you'll want to establish a meeting time and place with them and your parents so that you can get together as quickly as possible and then go home. Do the same thing for any activities they participate in. Make sure your parents are aware of the meeting space, so that your siblings know they can't just run off anywhere and then say that they didn't know where they were supposed to meet you!


If a younger sibling gets out of school or an activity earlier than you do, and it's not possible for them to wait somewhere safe, consider seeing if they can get a friend's parent to get them and have them stay at that friend's house until you can get there and take them home.
Sometimes, siblings may want to spend time with friends after school. Work with your siblings and parents to establish a list of friends that you and your siblings can visit, and who you can't.
A sibling that is closer in age to you or older will probably be more independent than a younger sibling, and won't need to be watched over as much.

, A schedule can make things much easier on you and your parents - if you have everything for a typical day planned out in advance, it will make transitions from one thing to another go much more smoothly. Take into consideration any extracurriculars or outside activities you have, how much homework you get, and if you have any siblings, their activities as well. Then, create a basic schedule around these.


A sample schedule might look something like this:

3:00 PM: Return home from school; let parent know
3:30 PM: Soccer practice at the field
4:30 PM: Return home from soccer; let parent know; begin homework
5:30 PM: Parent(s) are home


Set up a backup schedule if you don't feel comfortable with leaving the home. If you have any activities on your schedule that involve leaving the house, but you don't feel safe to leave for whatever reason, use the backup schedule and let a parent know. Be sure to also notify anyone else that may be involved (e.g. teachers, coaches, neighbors) so that they don't wonder where you are.

, Every family is different and has different priorities. When it comes to your family, you'll need to discuss this with them. What do your parents say needs to happen after you get home from school? Make sure that all basic house rules are discussed and agreed on beforehand. Here are some examples of questions to go over with your parents.


What needs to be done immediately after getting home and locking the door? For example, do you need to do certain chores?
Are you allowed to make phone calls on the landline or your cell phone? If either phone rings and you don't know the number, do you pick up?
If the doorbell rings, do you answer it to everyone, or only if it's certain people? Alternatively, do you just not answer the door at all?
Are you allowed to leave the house after arriving home? If so, what's the furthest place you're allowed to go?
What websites are you allowed to use while your parents aren't home? What websites can younger siblings use?
How much time on electronics (TV, computer, cell phone, etc.) are you and your siblings allowed to have? If you have to share electronics, what's the time limit for using it before the other sibling gets to use it?
What things in the house are off-limits? For example, your parents might be okay with you using the microwave, but not the stove.
What's the latest you should start your homework?

, You probably know your home very well, but it's still important to map out areas that have things you might need. Create a map of your house, place anything you may need in an agreed-upon spot that you or a sibling can reach, and keep the list pinned somewhere in case of emergencies. Make sure you know where the following things are in the house, and that they're marked on the map.


First-aid supplies
Emergency supplies - flashlight, battery-powered radio, batteries, money, and so forth
Places or things that are off-limits (e.g. garage, electrical appliances)
A route to escape the house in case of danger
Where to go in case of a natural disaster

, Similar to your home, it's important to map out your neighborhood, too. (If you walk home, you may want to even map out the whole route you take!) It's important to know what's a ""safe zone"" and what's not, especially if you're allowed to leave your house after your home, or if you have to in order to get to an activity. Make sure to map out the following places when mapping out your neighborhood:


Your home
Homes of trusted neighbors
Locations of places you may need to access (e.g. a field or park)
Safe roads (roads you can use to walk somewhere)
Unsafe roads (roads that you should never use)
Public places that are safe for you to go to
Routes taken if you need to walk a significant distance to your house

, Unfortunately, things do go wrong sometimes, and being caught unprepared can be scary, or even dangerous. Discuss with your parents and neighbors about what you should do in emergency situations that may arise. Here are some questions that may serve as inspiration for you to go over with your parents.


Where do you go if the house is unsafe when you arrive? (For example, the house smells of gas, or the window is shattered.)
Who is the ""emergency contact"" for school? If there's an emergency evacuation at school, and your parents can't get off work to pick you up, make sure that there's a designated adult you know who can pick you up.
What are the procedures in case of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, or severe storms?
What do you do in case of minor situations that don't require leaving the home, such as a power outage?
What do you do if you or a sibling gets lost, or a sibling doesn't come home at an agreed time? (Be sure to allow time for slack - a sibling coming home five minutes late isn't a big deal unless it's dark.)
If your mom or dad is late getting home, what's the maximum longest time that can be waited before contacting you? (For example, if your dad is fifteen minutes late, does he contact you and let you know?) If you aren't contacted, who do you call?
Is there an ""emergency signal"" that should mean ""pick up the phone""? For example, calling a parent only one time would signify that it's not an emergency, but calling twice in a row means that there's an emergency.

, Whether you're at home or out of the house, you'll want to have your phone with you at all times. (If you don't have a cell phone, ask for one - you stay home on your own, after all.) Make sure it's on - if school policy says you can't have it on during school hours, turn it on after school - and not silenced, so that you can hear calls or texts coming through. You'll want to make sure that you can reach your parents, and that they can reach you.


Make sure your phone is always ""alive"" - if an emergency comes up and your cell phone battery is dead, you may not be able to contact your parents or emergency services if you're alone. Every time your phone is at 25% of battery or below, plug your phone in and let it have time to charge. You may want to consider bringing a spare phone charger to school with you if your phone's battery runs down quite fast.
Avoid playing with your phone out in public. Even though you might want to play a game on your phone while walking home or waiting for the bus, don't! Playing on your phone distracts you from what's going on, meaning you could step into the street by mistake or become a target for bad people who want to hurt you. And even in the best case scenario of playing with your phone, you may just end up missing the bus because you didn't notice it was there!

Don't listen to music in public, either. Having headphones on prevents you from hearing everything going on around you. You may not hear someone coming up behind you, or the sound of a car coming. Be alert at all times.



, If you have any siblings, meet up at an established meeting place before going home. Don't leave without younger siblings, and check with siblings that are of the same age or older before you leave without them. A sibling of a similar age to you may want to (or need to) stay at school or their activity longer. Take this into account and plan around it.


If your sibling is disabled, whether physically or developmentally, don't leave them behind, regardless of their age. Wait for them, or go home and then pick them up when they're done with their activity. Someone in a wheelchair or crutches may have trouble defending themselves or taking certain routes home, and an autistic sibling or a sibling with Down Syndrome might not understand that strangers may want to hurt them.
If you have to stay late at school - for example, you participate in a club or you have detention - make other arrangements for younger siblings, so that they're not waiting alone or going home by themselves.

, Once you've gotten home, send your parents a text message saying that you've arrived home. Don't call them unless they've told you to call them when you arrive home; calling can be disruptive, especially if they work an extremely demanding job or are in a meeting.


Immediately after you get home, lock the door you came in through. You don't want to get so caught up in getting home that you leave the door unlocked.

, Your safety is not something you want to leave to chance. Stick to the previously-discussed house rules, and if anything new comes up, ask your parents about it for the future when they get home. Taking a chance with safety by ignoring previous rules is not a good idea.


Keep all doors and windows that lead outside locked. If you want to open a window, stay in the same room as the open window, and close the window when you leave the room.
Don't leave young siblings alone in the home. If your parents said it's okay to hang out in the neighborhood with a friend, but your little sibling won't go with you, stay with your sibling. Younger children may get hurt or cause a problem out of curiosity when they don't mean to (e.g. turning on the stove, and then leaving it on).

Never tell anyone you are home alone! Even if you're on the phone with your best friend, never say to anyone that your parents aren't there. If somebody asks for your parents over the phone, say that they're busy and can't come to the phone, not that they're at work.

, Your parents felt that you're responsible enough to stay home without an adult watching you; prove that to them, even though they're not with you! Take care of basic responsibilities at home when your parents aren't there. Going above and beyond could make your parents proud of you! Consider the following when it comes to responsibility:


Do your homework. Just because your parents aren't home doesn't mean you can skip out on doing your homework! You don't have to finish it or not need any help at all, but do what you can. Consider helping any younger siblings you may have out with their homework once you've finished, too.
Clean up after yourself. If you're playing a board game or learning to shuffle a deck of cards, clean up the game pieces or cards and put them back where you found them. If you eat a snack, clean up any spills you might have made, throw any garbage in the trash, and put dishes in the sink or the dishwasher. Leaving a mess for your parents to clean up when they get home is not only irresponsible, it's also considered rude.
Do your best to keep young siblings out of trouble. While you can't (and shouldn't) helicopter over your little brother's or sister's every move, do your best to know where they are in the house. Keep them away from household hazards, too; you don't want a younger sibling to turn the stove on, or knock down a bottle of chemical cleaners.

, It's important to be able to notice if something seems wrong, especially when you're home alone. Don't be so alert that you freak out when you hear the cat jump to the floor, but don't put on your headphones and drown out the world, either. Be awake and alert enough so that you can notice anything that just doesn't seem right.


If you can't focus without music or ambient noise, play your music quietly on a speaker, rather than headphones. Make sure you can still hear easily over it, and close your door if it irritates any siblings.

, Accidents happen. Maybe you scraped your arm when climbing a tree or accidentally cut yourself when working on your science project. Additionally, sometimes you or a sibling might get sick; fevers, colds, vomiting, the flu, and other illnesses or ailments are quite common. Be sure to know what to do in case of any of these situations, and where medical supplies are kept if you need them.


You may want to take a first-aid class or babysitting course, especially if you have younger siblings. These classes teach how to treat minor injuries, like shallow cuts, as well as more serious injuries, such as burns. Depending on your age, you may also learn CPR (for adults and kids, as well as babies) and the Heimlich maneuver - which can also be done on yourself in an emergency. Ask your parents if they can find one of these classes for you.
Sometimes, an injury or illness can't be treated at home. If you (or any siblings you may have) are very badly injured - for example, you have a fever higher than 104 degrees Fahrenheit, or your brother hit his head and can't walk - call emergency services, and then call your parents to let them know what happened. Don't text them - your parents may not notice a text, and they'll want to make sure you're okay!

, Sadly, there are some bad people in the world who want to hurt kids, especially girls. If you should ever find yourself in a bad situation, you'll want to know what to do and how to keep yourself safe. The biggest thing to remember is that nobody has the right to touch you somewhere you don't want to be touched or take you somewhere you don't want to go, and anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to hurt you. Keep your wits about you at all times. You are the most important thing in your life. Possessions don't matter - you do.


Make sure you know basic skills for bad situations: know how to call emergency services, how to text 911 if it's unsafe to call, how to find and use a payphone in case you can't use a cell phone, how to place a collect call if you're out of money, and how to get away from strangers.
Know what to do if someone breaks into your home, how to stop someone from taking you to somewhere you don't know, and what to do if someone you don't know follows you home. And remember: if somebody ever touches you in a way that makes you uncomfortable, it's okay to yell at them to get off of you!

You may want to learn self-defense techniques in case you need to fight back (but never attack someone unless they try and touch you). Consider a self-defense class such as karate or taekwondo.
If you have any siblings, make sure they know these skills, too. While they can't learn self-defense overnight, make sure to go over emergency procedures with them and that they understand to avoid strangers they don't know. If you're ever with siblings and a bad stranger tries to approach you, steer them away - you don't want your siblings ending up getting hurt, either.

Model a healthy diet for your children.,
Institute a “one-bite” policy.,
Take your children vegetable and fruit shopping with you.",How to Get Children to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables1," Children often follow the behaviors that they see their parents performing, and their diet is no exception. If your kids see you snacking on celery sticks, tomato slices, fresh pears, and berries, they’ll be more inclined to try those foods themselves.Eating well is especially effective if you and your children sit down to eat together. Invite them to join you over a plate of sliced tomatoes and carrots.
Kids often want to imitate their parents’ behavior, and will want to try “what Mommy’s eating” when they see you snacking.;
, Children will often decline to try a new vegetable simply because they dislike its smell or appearance, or on an abstract principle of automatically disliking anything new. Make a rule that your kids have to try one bite of any food, including chewing and swallowing the mouthful. Then, if the child genuinely dislikes the vegetable, they don’t have to eat another bite.However, if your child does not like the food, don't give up on that food forever. Try again in a few weeks, as it can take many tries before a child may decide they like a new food.
Often kids will find that the new fruits and veggies taste better than anticipated, and won’t have a problem cleaning their plate after taking the first bite of something new.

, Often kids will enjoy the experience of shopping for food, and they’ll find the vegetables’ and fruits’ bright colors and fun shapes appealing. Let your kids pick out a few new fruits and vegetables that they want to try, and allow them to watch as you prepare the food in the kitchen.If your kids are old enough, they could even help pick out a vegetable-based recipe or help you prepare the meal.Depending on your location and the time of year, you could also take kids to pick fruits and veggies in their natural environment: for example, an apple orchard or berry patch.
After you bring the produce home, let your children taste fresh, uncooked fruits and vegetables to show them that there’s nothing wrong with the produce in question.
If you are able, start a garden and grow some healthy vegetables and fruits with your kids.

",How to Get Fit As a Teenager," You can do it alone, but any extra support from friends or relatives is useful. Keep smiling and stay positive! You can even try to get fit with your friends or family. This can make it easier and definitely more fun!;
, Avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates found in foods like white bread and pasta, where possible. Complex carbohydrates, such as those in whole grains and beans, are a better source of energy. Moderate your fat intake, but don't try to eliminate it from your diet. Your body does need some. Don't worry if you're always hungry. It is the time in your life when you will grow the most, but when your stomach does grumble, don't reach for a slice of cake or a packet of chips, try yogurt, fruit or smoothies instead.

, You'll want to start out small and work your way up. Start going to a gym and, if you're really determined, get a Personal Trainer. They have you do a physical test and a written survey and match what you want to gain to your body type. This may cost a bit though.


If you're too young to work out in a gym, there's still plenty you can do! Get involved in a sport; soccer, tennis, football, basketball, and roller blading are all fun ways to get and keep yourself fit! Or, start doing push-ups. Do as many as you can every day and keep a log book of records and goals. Try sit-ups, pull-ups, and jumping jacks, too. Go jogging, sprinting, and running as much as possible. If you are getting better at running, maybe you could join the cross country team. Get a friend to join you, this will get you both motivated.

, You have to keep working to stay fit, so form healthy habits that will last you a lifetime!

, Walk, dance, be active. Thirty minutes, ( three 10 minutes sessions are fine) most days of the week and you will reduce stress, gain energy, and reduce risk for diseases.

, Trust your instincts, they are usually right. If you feel uncharacteristic pain during a move, stop. I’m not talking about the “burn” of exercise, I’m talking a pain that is unusual for what you are doing. Notify your doctor of the problem.

, If you work out to feel energized or happier you are more likely to stick with it. Those who only do it to look good are less inclined to keep it up.

, Find a friend who has shed pounds and work out with them. You will be likelier to stick with the regime and will have some great support.

, For some great muscles, do two weight sessions a week, using weights heavy enough so the last two reps feel tough to eke out.

, Take two days off a week to recover from your efforts. Let your muscles repair themselves between strength sessions. (Do cardio on these days if you want.)

, Always start your workout with 5-10 minutes of easy light cardio. Warming up helps prevent injury and can help to maximize the calories burnt during your entire workout.

, If you are working out and you can chat with your workout buddy, but you are too winded to sing, you are working at a perfect moderate pace.

, If you take the time to taper off your workout with a cooling down stage you will feel less taxed when you are done.

, Every few weeks, increase the intensity, use different weights or swap to some new moves or classes to stay challenged.

, It's so much more fun with friends!

,, Don't make it too grueling!

Incorporate vegetables into your cooking.,
Try new methods of preparing vegetables.,
Vary the vegetables and fruits that you cook.,
Serve vegetables and fruits for snacks.,
Let your kids eat fresh fruits and vegetables raw.,
Sneak fruits and veggies into foods you prepare.",How to Get Children to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables2," There are many delicious and kid-friendly recipes that incorporate vegetables and fruits. If kids find that there are fruits or vegetables in the food that is being served in front of them, they may be more inclined to eat the fruits or veggies.


If your children dislike seeing the vegetables in their plates or bowls, serve them in an unrecognizable form. For example, run the vegetables through a blender to make them less noticeable, then mix the veggies into a soup or a curry.

, If you kids haven’t enjoyed vegetables in ways they’ve eaten before, change the way you’re cooking veggies. Try roasting them: roasting vegetables brings out their sweet flavor and changes the texture as well, since the vegetables become crispy and slightly caramelized in the oven. Roast items including: bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, zucchini, and tomatoes.Try cooking vegetables in a soup: butternut squash soup is delicious and kids shouldn’t mind the texture. Broccoli cheddar soup is another vegetable-heavy option that kids may enjoy, especially if they get to add more cheese to their own bowl of soup.

, This will have two benefits: (1) you’ll expose your child to a larger number of healthy foods, and (2) you’ll be able to feed your child different types of nutrients. When planning daily or weekly meals, plan to offer at least one veggie or fruit that’s high in vitamin A (like carrots or sweet potato), one that’s high in vitamin C (like oranges, bell peppers, or broccoli) , and one that’s high in fiber (such as celery).Just like adults, children will have natural likes and dislikes when it comes to fruits and vegetables. If your child sincerely dislikes broccoli, serve more dishes with a vegetable that you child prefers.

, Kids often get hungry during the day, and will ask for a snack. Although they’re likely to prefer an unhealthy option—such as potato chips or a candy bar—you can influence your kids to eat healthier by serving them fruits and veggies. Rather than giving them the option to choose the snack, simply set a plate of fruits or vegetables in front of them.


If your kids are surprised and ask for a sugary snack instead, try saying, “Maybe you can have that next time you’re hungry—but right now we’re having apple slices as our snack.”
Occasionally, you may need to reward your children for eating healthy food, such as fruits and vegetables. Rather than threatening to punish kids if they don’t finish their vegetables, say something like, “After you eat your corn, you can have a cookie for dessert.” Or, better yet, reward them with a non-food item such as a sticker or time to play their favorite game.

, Children are often put off by the limp, soft, or mushy consistency of cooked vegetables. Letting them eat the produce raw will let the vegetables retain their crunch—a texture that kids often find amusing or fun. If they like the texture well enough, kids may even start asking for raw veggies as a snack.Cut up raw fruit and vegetables to make them easier and more fun to eat.
If your children struggle to eat raw vegetables such as carrots or celery, serve them with a side of ranch dressing, hummus, or peanut butter. Although this will add some fat and calories to the raw veggies, it may motivate your kids to eat the veggies., For parents with the pickiest children, who may refuse to eat fruits or vegetables in any form, you may need to add vegetables to your child’s food without telling them. For example, if you’re preparing kid-favorites like pizza, macaroni and cheese, or hot dogs, top the dishes with veggies before serving: basil leaves and chopped tomatoes for pizza; peas and chopped carrots for mac and cheese; and pickles, onions, and bell peppers for hot dogs.Smoothies are also a great way to add fruit and vegetables to your child's diet. Try making your child a smoothie with some fresh or frozen fruit and a handful of greens, like spinach or kale.
Some vegetable-based breads are sweet and may remind children more of eating cake than of eating vegetables. Banana bread or muffins, carrot bread (or carrot cake), and zucchini bread—or variations on these breads—may be tasty enough to make kids forget that they’re eating vegetables.
If you’re desperate, pureed vegetables (such as tomatoes, squash), can be served in pasta sauce. Kids usually won’t notice the slight change in texture and flavor. Another option is mixing some carrot juice into orange juice. Kids shouldn't notice the difference. You could also try prepared vegetable and fruit juices such as V8.

Present dietary facts in a way that your child can understand.,
Convince your child of the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables.,
Encourage your child to eat their daily recommended serving size.",How to Get Children to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables3," Inform your child that eating a balanced diet is important. Fruits and vegetables are a great source of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. You’ll need to take your child’s age into consideration with this strategy; state the importance of a healthy diet in a way that your child can understand.Some of the many benefits of eating fruits and vegetables every day include: helping children and teenagers grow and develop, boosting vitality and energy, reducing the risk of obesity and other chronic diseases, such as heart disease and high blood pressure.Teach your children to eat sugar in moderation. Too much sugar in a diet may increase the child’s chances of developing diabetes and other problems such as obesity and cavities.

, Most kids aren’t too concerned about their health, and find words like “fiber,” “vitamins,” and “nutrition” to be abstract terms.Be imaginative with your explanations; explain that vegetables will help kids grow bigger and stronger.


For example, pretend that your child is a dinosaur who needs to eat several “trees” of broccoli to stay strong.
Try telling your child something like, “I bet that Batman always eats carrots; that’s why he’s so strong.”
You could bring sports into the discussion if your kids are athletic. Explain to your children that doing sports and having an unhealthy diet just doesn’t work. Say something like, “If you don’t eat enough vegetables, you won’t have the energy you need to play soccer.”

, The American Academy of Pediatrics has established guidelines stating that children should eat two to three servings of fruit per day. As a broad rule, children should eat fruits and veggies with every meal, and these should fill roughly half of their plate.This breaks down by age group:


Toddlers (1–3 years), a single serving of fruit equals:

¼ cup of cooked, frozen, or canned fruit.
½ piece of fresh fruit (half an apple or pear, for example).
¼ to ½ cup of fruit juice.


Young children (4–6 years), a single serving of fruit equals:

¼ cup of cooked, frozen, or canned fruit.
½ piece of fresh fruit (half an apple or pear, for example).
1/3 cup of fruit juice.


Older children (7–10 years), a single serving of fruit equals:

1/3 cup of cooked, frozen, or canned fruit.
1 piece of fresh fruit.
½ cup of fruit juice.

Find ways to avoid stress-related weight gain.",How to Get a Flat Stomach As a Girl," Spot reduction, which means reducing fat in one specific area, is a weight loss myth. Toning certain areas, like the arms and stomach, can make them look trimmer and thinner, but to remove fat you have to focus on your entire body.


Losing weight and keeping it off involves a calorie controlled diet and 60 minutes of moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, a day. Fat from your belly is usually the first to go during a weight loss regimen, and regular high-intensity aerobic workouts tend to lead to slimmer waists.Circuit training workouts are another good exercise that combat belly fat by reducing fat throughout the body. Circuit workouts can be found online or you can enroll in a class at your gym. Workouts are divided into circuits that combine cardio exercises. Circuits are performed continually, with no breaks in between. A good circuit routine increases heart rate and strengthens a variety of muscles, shifting focus to the entire body and not just the stomach.;
, To tone your stomach, you should focus on your core muscles by doing exercises that target the abdomen. This won't help you lose fat, but it can make an already skinny stomach appear more toned and, therefore, flat. It can also increase the effectiveness of current workouts, resulting in you burning more calories during your normal routine.


The crunch is a classic core strengthening exercise. Lie on your back and place your feet against a wall so they're bent at a 90-degree angle. Cross your arms on your chest, lift your head and shoulders forward and take in three breaths before lying back down. Repeat.Planks are another popular core exercise. Get in the push-up position with your hands under your shoulders. Keep your legs straight out in behind you and your feet together. Instead of lowering down for a push-up, hold the pose as long as you can. Challenge yourself each time to hold the pose longer.Workout routines like Pilates and yoga focus primarily on core muscles. You can enroll in a class or find routines online. Many YouTube vloggers and exercise enthusiasts post easy-to-follow Pilates and yoga routines that can be done from home with no more than a mat and basic workout clothing.

, While spot reduction is impossible, some exercises focus on areas towards the abdomen. Side bends can increase blood flow to the abdomen which can increase oxygen levels and may help you gain muscle, toning your stomach. It also might help you strengthen your body overall, resulting in more efficient workouts and less soreness.Bend to one side while holding your opposite arm over your head and then bend to the other side, raising your other arm. Do this until you've done 10 stretches on either side of your body. Many people use weights during side bends, but this is bad for your muscles and can also result in a thicker waist due to excess muscle.When trying to narrow the waist, focus on exercises that cause your waist to twist and rotate, so that you are not adding bulk to your waist.

, Salt can have a negative effect on any weight loss routine, which can sabotage your ability to lose troublesome belly fat. Especially short term, this is a quick way to limit bloat and get a flatter stomach.


Bloating in the stomach often results from carrying excess water. Water retention in the body is related to a heavy intake of sodium.Decrease your sodium intake. Read food labels to see how much sodium is in the products you consume. Be careful, however, as labels can be deceitful. Sometimes, a bag of chips doesn't look too unhealthy until you realize the nutritional information is ""per serving"" and the bag comes with 2.5 servings. Be realistic about how much of a product you expect to eat and calculate how much sodium you'll consume.Avoid processed foods and do not add too much salt to table foods. Watch out for canned vegetables and soy sauces, which can be salt-heavy., Processed or refined grains, like those found in white rices and breads, contain empty calories that can manipulate hormone levels in the body and result in excess fat production. Swapping refined grains for whole grains when possible can result in a flatter stomach.


Whole grains are a group of foods that contain all the naturally-occurring nutrients of a food's entire grain seed in its original proportion. Processed grains are grains that have been cracked, rolled, crushed, cooked, or otherwise tampered with, resulting in less overall nutritional value. Whole wheats, like whole wheat bread and brown rice, are a type of whole grain. Other whole grains include barley, buckwheat, oats, and quinoa.Eating refined grains triggers a body process in which blood sugar levels rise and insulin spikes. When this occurs, the body is more ready to deposit fat and tends to do so in the abdomen.Whole grain, high fiber foods help regulate insulin levels in the body. This lowers overall blood glucose levels, which results in a reduction of fat deposition.Purchase whole wheat breads, brown rices, oatmeal, and whole wheat tortillas over refined varieties. Always read the food labels however. Oftentimes products labeled as ""whole wheat"" are secretly made with mostly refined wheat and only a small amount of whole wheat flour. Whole wheat flour should be the first item on a product's ingredient list if it's truly whole wheat. Breads made at a grocery store's bakery and not shipped from elsewhere are more likely to be truly whole wheat., Whole wheat is just the beginning. For a flat, trimmed stomach, the bulk of your calories should come from healthy foods.


Ditch sugary and processed foods. Potato chips, TV dinners, and fast foods should be purged from your diet.Beans and other legumes are high-quality carbohydrates packed with protein. Beans tend to help you feel fuller faster and help you burn fat after a workout. Try swapping out meats like chicken and beef for black, pinto, or kidney beans for a few meals each week.Berries, such as blueberries and strawberries, are low-calorie and a good source of essential vitamins that can keep your body healthy. Keep a bowl of berries in your fridge if you need a snack and go for that over pretzels or sweets.Nuts are filled with heart-healthy fat and are filling enough to reduce hunger cravings. Be careful, however. While healthy, nuts are high-calorie and it's easy to accidentally go overboard and end up gaining weight by overeating., Alcohol is a bad idea for anyone wanting to lose belly fat for a variety of reasons.


Heavy drinkers tend to have what's known as a ""beer gut"" or a ""beer belly."" This is because alcohol releases estrogen into the bloodstream, which makes you more likely to hold onto fat and more likely to gain weight.Alcohol also increases appetite while simultaneously lowering inhibitions and self-control. Binge drinking episodes often end in late night snacking or eating junk food. The calories from alcohol combine with the calories from excess eating while drinking, resulting in massive caloric intake in a single night.

, Drinking water throughout the day has an impact on weight loss. Staying hydrated can result in a slimmer waistline


Numerous studies have found a correlation between water and weight loss. While scientists are not sure why water has an effect on lowering body weight, it's suspected water helps fill up the stomach. This makes you feel full and less likely to overeat.Aim to drink two eight-ounce glasses of water 30 minutes before each meal and two more glasses throughout the day. Drinking before a meal fills up your stomach, resulting in your eating less during breakfast, lunch, and dinner., Stress contributes to weight gain in multiple ways. When we're stressed, we're less likely to eat right and exercise, for one, and certain hormones released when we're stressed can contribute to fat retention in the body. Finding ways to cope with stress can help ward off the unwanted weight gain associated with it.


Ask yourself why you're eating each time your prepare a meal. Are you eating because you're truly hungry or because something's on your mind? If it's the latter, find a more effective way to deal with the issue than eating.Keep typical comfort foods away from your home and office. If you have less access to the foods you consume when stressed, the temptation is easier to avoid.Find a distraction if you're tempted to eat when stressed. Puzzles, games, and reading can be an alternative to eating. You can even use light exercise, like a short walk, as a means to cope rather than going for food.Look into practicing relaxation skills like yoga, deep breathing, stretching, and meditation. Find an approach to stress that works for you and practice it when you start to feel anxiety coming on."

Don't believe everything you see on the internet.,
Try an anonymous phone chat service.,
Never post your personal information online i.e.",How to Use Teen Chat Rooms and Dating Sites Safely," It is extremely easy to lie about who you are on an online profile. You can post any picture of yourself and claim it is of you. Internet predators do this without remorse. These predators pose as teenage girls when they are really grown men and pictures posted alongside the false profile sometimes fool other users. Predators also pose as ideal boyfriends, making them seem to be every girls dream guy, and again, they add pictures to bolster the deception. The internet predators then befriend teens and work to earn their trust. On occasions, they try to make the teens fall in “love” with them. Once trust is earned it seems only natural to make a date to meet face-to-face. Since many teens that meet people online do so in secret, without telling parents or even real life friends about their activities, face-to-face meetings are often set up without anybody else knowing. It is ironic that the same teens that post many pictures of themselves leave detailed profiles at public sites, are unlikely to tell people in real time what they are up to.;
, This will mean that you can speak to the other person before meeting them face to face. Obviously, if they have a voice of an older person or don’t sound quiet right this should send alarm bells ringing and you should switch off the call immediately. With an anonymous phone service you never have to give out your number and can use a username or tag id. A typical anonymous phone chat service would be a company such as paginglist.com.

, your home or mobile phone number or your address! To be safe, always tell your parents or a friend where you are going. If you have to meet in secret for a particular reason (not recommended), always meet in a public place like a shopping centre or a coffee shop.

Watch out for limited (often flattering) pictures of themselves; or occasionally very obviously fake pictures (professional, watermarked, inconsistent).,
Look at their interaction very carefully.,
Challenge as to why they add you.,
Keep your guard up.,
Notice if they are very heavy with the flattery.,
Don't fall in with their attempts to meet you in person.",How to Tell if Someone Online Might Be a Stalker," Many of these people, particularly on social networking sites, have fake personas or limited information. Often these people don't bother with about me sections as it opens too many traps for them to be caught out in. Does it seem too wooden or stereotypical? For example, somebody posing to be a teenager will include only the current most popular bands and keep interests generic (hanging with friends). If it's somebody you know, they will more than likely list interests that are opposite to their real interests, but let themselves down with telltale phrasing and punctuation.;
, Do their friends consist mostly of a particular demographic of people (young, good-looking girls for example). Do any of their friends appear to know them? Are they tagged in any pictures? Are they scattered across the country... or are they purely from one place? Do they have a lot of puzzled comments asking who they are/why the add? Have they hidden their information feed? None of these factors are foolproof; but if the profile ticks a few of these boxes, there's something odd about it.

, Often to which they sweet-talk 'I thought you looked gorgeous babe' etc. On this note, also beware of comments such as I've seen you around campus or didn't we get chatting at that party last week? Remember, if you regularly change your status and they've been lurking they could know what you've been up to, to which they could construct a story that sounds plausible. If they have no mutual friends or events, this is far-fetched. If they do have mutual friends, ask if anyone knows or remembers them. If they're claiming to be from your community or to have ran into you at a social event, somebody will know them, or there will at least be faces and names you recognise in their friends. If they're making you feel threatened or unnerved, don't be afraid to check college systems for their names.

, If they know any of your insecurities or weaknesses, they have a tool of which to play you by.

, They will often shower you with compliments, and are very eager to move things on quickly. Don't believe somebody online telling you they love you - They don't know you. they aren't going to buy you a diamond ring worth millions and whisk you away to the Bahamas, and you cannot tell if you're somebody's soulmate online.

, They will often try to arrange meet-ups in obscure places, putting you at a disadvantage... or insist on picking you up/ 'taking' you somewhere. if you are going to meet somebody online, make sure it is in a familiar busy place, that you can easily leave and that doesn't put you at a travel advantage. Don't go anywhere quiet with them. Tell somebody where you are going, and if it makes you feel more comfortable arrange to have a friend stay close so they can 'bump into' you in emergency. If somebody is genuine, they will accept all these rules.

Come up with your own exercise routine to do at home and get a group together to participate. Try a structure like: crunches, planks, squats, plyometrics, push-ups, and triceps dips off the edge of a chair. Create a circuit by assigning a number of ""reps"" to each activity (e.g. 20 crunches) before moving on. Go through the whole circuit maybe twice when you start, and you can gradually increase how many times you go through the whole routine as your fitness improves.You can also try getting really original and making your own obstacle course. Use old tires, jump ropes, chairs – anything that can turn into something you can climb over, jump over, dodge, or workout with. Challenge each other to races through the course.

Whether you play for your school’s team or look online for local community teams, there are so many sports and activities that you’re likely to find one that excites you. Get the team dynamic with volleyball, touch football, basketball, baseball or softball, field hockey or ice hockey, lacrosse, cricket, cheerleading, wrestling, rowing, or soccer.

Think about what you want to get out of your fitness. Look good? Feel great? Get stronger? Meet new people while being active? Know your goal, and make it specific and realistic. Write your goal down and your brain will know you really mean it.For example, maybe you want run a 5k a for charity. Set small attainable goals like, “I’ll be able to run 1 mile three days this week, and 2 miles four days next week,” etc. If you want to join your school’s soccer team, set goals about what skills to practice and how to build endurance up until tryouts.

, Make sure you drink plenty of fluids before, during, and after any exercise. Find juices or low-sugar drinks that you like to replace drinking soda.This isn’t an exciting goal, just a really important one for staying healthy.

Have a plan.,
Make a meal plan.,
Make better choices.,
Don't skip meals.",How to Eat Healthy During Middle School1," Bagging a lunch at 7:30 in the morning can be quite stressful, not to mention the fact that the foods that you insert in your panic may be unhealthy. Prevent this stress by packing your lunch the night before. It is okay if you need to make something in the morning because it might not be warm if it is sitting out all night; just have your materials ready in the morning, so all you have to do it pop the food in the microwave and put it in your lunch.;
, Eating tuna fish sandwiches and orange juice every day can be quite boring. Eating the same thing every day will make you get sick of the food, and even tempt you to throw away your lunch, therefore skipping a meal, which is very unhealthy. To prevent that from happening, make a monthly meal plan.


For example, tuna fish sandwiches on Monday, tacos on Tuesday, a salad with nuts on Wednesday, veggie burritos on Thursday, and pizza on Friday.
Mix up your choices along the week for every month, so your lunch seems like something different every day. Change the food that you pack each month, so you don't get tired of the other foods that you have been packing. It is okay to pack something special or different once in a while; just keep most of your meals consistent.

, Eating all junk food every week doesn't sound very healthy, now does it? You should always pack a variety of healthy foods, not a variety of unhealthy stuff. Make sure that you have all of these five items in your lunch: veggies, fruits, grains, proteins, and dairy.


An example of a healthy lunch could be a cup of greek yogurt (dairy) with fruit in it (fruits), a slice of whole-wheat toast with butter/jam on it (grains), a handful of almonds (proteins), and a small serving of veggie pasta (grains and veggies).
You don't necessarily have to have one of each food group every time; just try to make sure that the servings of these five items are fairly equal. Experiment, and try your own combinations of foods! You might create a dish that you really like!

, You might be tempted to skip meals, or throw away part of your lunch, but don't. This is the most important part of eating healthy in Middle School. You can create the healthiest lunch in the world, but if you don't eat it, then all of that goes to waste. Even though some of your friends might finish faster, or skip meals, take the time to eat your lunch. Don't talk too much during mealtimes, because while you are talking away about your vacation to Hawaii, your friends will be finishing up their lunches. Instead, talk about small things, like ""I love your vest!"", or ""Ugh, there is so much rain nowadays!""


Do not rush just because your friends finished eating faster; eat at your own pace, as they will wait for you, or you will catch up with them at the courtyard or library. They are your friends, after all, and you would do the same for them.

Do your research.,
Make a plan.,
Prepare in advance.",How to Eat Healthy During Middle School2," Look online at your school's website or ask a student at that school what the typical options for school lunches are. Do you really want to buy lunch at school, or are you just buying because all your friends are? However, you may find yourself in some situations where you cannot bring a bagged lunch to school. When you collect enough information about school lunches, then make a plan of what you are going to eat, as explained in the next step.

, Most times, students just grab any old food item and go. Spend time to make a plan about what you are going to eat. Include milk, one entrée, a side, and a small snack.

, Bring a bottle of water and a granola bar, in case you don't like what's being offered for lunch, or worst-case, the cafeteria runs out of food. This way, you can still keep your energy up although you did not get a lunch. Even if you are buying or bringing, always keep a water bottle and granola bar in case something happens and you can't get lunch, or you just need a small snack to get your energy up.

Pack smaller portions of food.,
Pack a wider variety of food.,
Pack food that can be eaten quickly.,
Separate foods.",How to Encourage Kids to Eat More Lunch1," One strategy for getting your kids to eat more of their lunches is to actually pack smaller portions of food. This might seem counterintuitive, however, large amounts of food can be overwhelming to children, especially if they have a limited amount of time to eat. School lunches can sometimes be as short as 20 minutes, so big portions might seem like too much to eat in the allotted amount of time and, therefore, be ignored.


For example, instead of packing a whole turkey sandwich, try providing just half of a turkey sandwich. This portion may seem more manageable in the time your child has to eat lunch.;
, If you are packing smaller portions of food, you can also pack a wider variety. Instead of providing a sandwich and an apple, you could provide half a sandwich, a few slices of apple, crackers, and some raw veggies. Providing a wider variety of food in your kid’s lunch may encourage them to eat more because, in addition to the portions being more manageable, it will also provide them with options of what they want to eat.


For instance, say you pack your child a turkey sandwich and an apple, but they only eat half the sandwich and a few bites of the apple. It could be that your child just wasn’t in the mood for what you packed them that day. Had you packed a variety of things, there’s a good chance your child would find something in their lunch they wanted to eat.Include foods with different colors, textures, and shapes. These can include colorful fruits and veggies with dips, proteins like hardboiled eggs, chickpeas, or yogurt, and whole grains like bread, muffins, or crackers.You can even change the shape of same foods from day to day. For example, on one day you can cut the sandwich into triangles; the next day, you can use a cooker cutter to make it a star-shape.

, If time is a concern for your child, you can encourage them to eat more by packing foods that are easy to eat fast. For example, pack sliced fruit instead of whole, cut sandwiches into bite-sized pieces, or provide food that can be eaten with their fingers. In addition, make sure food packaging is easy-to-open. It might even help to practice opening containers at home., Children often go through stages where they don’t want their food to touch. If your kid is not eating their lunch, it’s possible this could be the problem. Try deconstructing the food you put into their lunch, rather than providing already put-together options.


For example, pack sandwich condiments (like lettuce, tomato, mustard, or mayonnaise) separately and let your child put their sandwich together. It could be they just enjoy making their own sandwich, or maybe the condiments make the bread soggy when it is pre-assembled."
"
Ask your child what they want for lunch.,
Ask your child to help you pack their lunch.,
Allow them to choose how they’d like to carry their lunch.",How to Encourage Kids to Eat More Lunch2," It could be your child is not eating their lunch because their tastes have changed or they’re simply bored with what you’re packing for them. Ask your child if there are any specific foods they’d like you to pack and, if it’s feasible, provide those foods.


For example, maybe your kid hasn’t been eating their sandwich because they don’t like the type of bread you’ve been putting it on. Making the sandwich on the type of bread your child prefers could fix the problem.If you’re having trouble getting your child to pick foods that are feasible to pack for lunch, try giving them two choices and allowing them to pick between the two. For example, ask them, “Do you want an apple or orange for your fruit?” Or, “Would you like your sandwich on wheat bread or in a wrap?” This will allow you to control the types of foods they eat, but still involve them in the process., In addition to letting your child help pick out what foods they want in their lunch, they may be more motivated to eat it if they also get to help assemble and pack it. After your child has helped you choose what to take in their lunch, get everything out and ask them to help you pack it into their lunchbox. This can give your child a sense of pride and a boost of confidence.


Depending on their age, your child may not be able to help with every aspect of packing their lunch. For example, you probably don’t want your preschooler wielding a knife to cut their sandwich in half. Have them help with what they can, like bagging up fruits and veggies and arranging everything inside their lunchbox., You can also let your child choose how they’d like to carry their lunch—in a lunchbox or a brown paper bag, for example. Allowing them to choose a new lunchbox might make them more interested in what’s inside. Or, maybe they’ve outgrown the cartoon lunchbox they carried last year and are embarrassed to take it to the cafeteria.

"
"
Ask your child why they’re not eating their lunch.,
Discuss the importance of eating lunch.,
Contact a school employee.",How to Encourage Kids to Eat More Lunch3," There could be any number of reasons for this. For example, maybe they are tired of certain foods, are spending too much time socializing at lunch, or are being bullied in the cafeteria. The best way to get to the bottom of why your child isn’t eating all of their lunch could be to ask them.


Try saying something like this: “I’ve noticed you’re not finishing your lunch most of the time. Can you tell me why? It’s important to have a good lunch so you can have plenty of energy for the rest of your day.”, Kids may not realize how important lunch is to their daily energy and concentration. It could be helpful to talk about how eating lunch can help them get through the rest of their day. For example, let them know that foods like carbohydrates and protein provide their bodies with energy. In addition, let them know being hungry can affect their concentration and performance. Skipping lunch could cause them not to perform to the best of their abilities in school, sports, or other extracurricular activities., If you didn’t get an answer from your child about why they’re not eating lunch, you might want to set up a meeting with their school principle or lunchroom attendant to see if they can shed some light on the problem. For instance, maybe your child is too embarrassed or scared to tell you they’re being made fun of during lunch. A school employee may be able to tell you what’s going on and give you some suggestions on how to fix the situation.


If this meeting uncovers any new information, bring it up to you child so you can talk about it. Try saying, “Mrs. Smith told me you’ve been having trouble with another kid in the lunch room. I want you to know I’m here for you and would like to help you resolve the issue so you can get back to relaxing and eating your meal during lunch. Can you tell me what’s going on?”

Pack a bento box.,
Celebrate holidays with lunch.,
Prepare wraps.,
Add dressings to fruits and vegetables.",How to Encourage Kids to Eat More Lunch4," Bento boxes contain a variety of healthy foods like vegetables, sandwiches, rice, and fruit in a small box. The food is arranged into appealing shapes, such as animal faces, stars, or flowers.


For example, you can make rice balls by cooking short-grain rice. Roll it into a ball, and then shape it into a rabbit's face. Use sliced carrots and peas to make the face. On one side of the rice balls, put melon cut into flower shapes. On the other, you can put put carrot sticks.
Cut a sandwich into the shape of a cat's head, and use small pieces of cheese to make the face and ears. Stack crackers beside the sandwich, and make a small mouse shape out of cheese to put on top., Create special lunches for holidays and other occasions. This will help make the day extra exciting, and it will create variety in your child's lunch. It may encourage them to eat more of their lunch on that day.


For Halloween, peel oranges, and use a food coloring marker to draw jack-o-lantern faces on them. They will look like pumpkins.On St. Patrick's Day, put only green foods in their lunchbox. Make them a wrap in a spinach tortilla. Match it with green grapes and a green cookie.
For Valentine's Day, make a raspberry or strawberry jelly sandwich. Cut a heart out of the top slice of bread so that it looks like a red heart is appearing in the middle of the sandwich.

, If your child does not enjoy sandwiches or if they are not eating the bread, you might try making them a wrap instead. Place the ingredients in the center of the wrap, and roll it up. You can slice the wrap to make smaller pinwheel pieces that are easy for a child to grasp and eat.


If your child likes fruit, make a strawberry wrap. Spread a little bit of cream cheese on the wrap. Pile spinach and strawberries on top, and roll it up.Cut up some turkey, and put it in a wrap with lettuce, tomato, and provolone cheese slices.

, If your child is hesitant to eat fruit or vegetables, you can dress it up by adding chocolate, peanut butter, or other dressings. These will make the fruit taste more appealing, and it can encourage them to eat more of it.


Slice apples, and smear a little bit of peanut or almond butter on each slice.Slice celery in half, and fill the inside with cream cheese. Add either plain or yogurt-covered raisins on top to make ants on a log.Melt chocolate chips, and dip strawberries into them. Let the chocolate shell harden in the fridge before packing them in your child's lunch.

Keep private things private.,
Be respectful of others.,
Expect respect in return.,
Deal with spammers.,
Deal with stalkers.,
Link with other bloggers in your topic area, your local area or just because you're fellow bloggers.",How to Stay Safe when Using a Blog," Be very careful about what you share on a blog. Information that can identify where you live, where you shop, what car you drive, where you kids go to school, and so forth can be open to abuse in the wrong hands. It's a good idea to think ahead about the things you won't reveal and decide to code them, change identities or simply not mention these things at all. Some things to consider include:


Do not show a photograph of the front of your house or give out your street address in your blog.
Do not give out secure information such as your Social Security ID, bank account information, work address, credit card details, and so forth.
Think twice before sharing images of your family members. Do they want to be so exposed anyway?
Always blur identifiable things such as car number plates and the mailbox number.
Avoid stating where you are going on such and such a date. Do not give out children's drop-off or pick-up times or locations.
Some bloggers refer to family members and friends using aliases or substitute names. For example: DH (dear/darling husband), X, the ducklings, my three little mice, Aunt Broomhilda/Esmeralda, and so forth, can be used in place of real names that identify the persons involved.

For example: ""My mother-in-law so reminds me of Cleopatra, that I am going to refer to her as such from this point on."" Readers who regularly follow you will know who you mean, and you can make an occasional reminder comment now and then to update new readers, or answer questions in the comments section, if appropriate.

;
, Do not mention people without their consent. It's one thing to be friends with people, quite another to start discussing their personal lives online. Ask before you publish. To avoid problems, always write respectfully about identifiable people, to avoid the potential for defaming them or upsetting them. Moreover, by being respectful, you will avoid attracting nasty comments or trolling behavior based on the things you've said about people.


Be aware that anyone can find your blog and that even if you have tried to de-identify a person by changing a name/place of work, etc., by providing details of incidents and character traits, it can often still be possible to piece together who the person is, especially in relation to who you are. If it's gossip and it's malicious, humiliating or nasty, don't write it and definitely don't publish it, regardless of how much you've tried to cover up the tracks.
It is possible to limit a blog to friends only, to those persons who have been accepted and given the link to your blog. You may also wish to protect such access with a password.

, Do not let the comments get to you and be sure to manage them well. While it's useful to get feedback, not all of your comments will be constructive or considerate. Sometimes people are in a bad mood, sometimes they're trolling and sometimes they're genuinely mean people. It's not a good idea to take any of it personally, as this is the lot for anyone who publishes. It's important to manage your comments. You have a right to remove comments that are spiteful, nasty, contain curse words or generally display vileness. Your readers don't need to read that, and you don't need such comments to hang around reminding you of the baseness of some people's uncontrolled impulses.

, Spammers can spoil your blog, especially if you don't clear out their spam. Be on top of it at all times and clear it away whenever it lands in your comments boxes. If your blog provider allows for blocking of spam, use that resource without mercy.

, Nip stalker behavior in the bud quickly. First, don't engage with such persons––make it clear you're not interested in being part of their twisted exchange of abuse or baiting. Second, contact the service providers, both for the blog and for the internet connection, and inform them of any such misuse of the communications system if someone is persistently harassing or bothering you. Third, if these actions do not prevent the person from stalking and harassing you, contact the police and see what else can be done.

, It can be helpful to have support from other bloggers and you can share stories, solutions and safety tips among one another.

Traditional scams usually come in the form of some bogus offer. It's often a business offer that claims you can make a large sum of money each month online. It can sometimes be a health and fitness offer, boasting natural remedies of new foods or exercises that can help you shed unreasonable amounts of weight or inches in short periods of time. Usually, the scam is an attempt to fool the recipient into giving out personal information online.Sometimes scam e-mails will offer discount software that, if downloaded, contains malware, viruses, and other malicious software designed to get personal information off your computer.Certain frauds, referred to as 419 frauds, work by enticing a victim with a series of phony documents and claims, usually regarding large sums of money or legal violations. These e-mails might claim you are next of kin to a wealthy Nigerian business owner, for example, or accuse you of violating the Patriot Act and then demand you pay some kind of fine. The goal of such frauds is to get as much money and information as possible from you. Once the scammer feels he's gotten all he can, he'll cease communication.Traditional scam e-mails can usually be spotted by common sense alone. The old adage ""If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is"" is a good measure of a scam e-mail. Conversely, if it seems too bad to be true this is also probably the case. You likely cannot lose 20 pounds in one week using newly discovered berries from the Amazon rainforest. You also probably did not violate the Patriot Act by sharing a news article on Facebook.;
, Phishing scams are a newer form of scam e-mail. In a phishing scam, the scammer imitates a legitimate website to trick you into logging on to a phony version of a well known site like Facebook or Twitter. The goal is to either get you to inadvertently download malware or to give out sensitive personal information.Usually, a phishing e-mail will appear to be a legitimate e-mail from your bank or a social media website like Facebook. It will have an urgent subject line like ""Problem with Your Bank/Account"" and the content will demand you validate your account by filling out an online form. When you click the link provided, the site will look remarkably similar to the real website. This is why phishing scams are so dangerous. They're often successful.You should regard any e-mail asking for personal information over the internet with skepticism. Call your bank to verify the legitimacy of any e-mail you receive, and google the subject line if the e-mail's from a social media site. Chances are, your google search results will identify the subject line as part of a recent scam.There is also a website, known as the Anti-Phishing Workshop Group, that keeps and up-to-date catalogue of various phishing scams. Look through their listings if you receive any suspicious e-mails you suspect are phishing scams., Trojan Horse e-mails usually operate by offering some kind of service via download, only to release viruses onto your computer.


Oftentimes, Trojan e-mails will have a strange subject line and then ask recipients to open an attachment. For example, the popular ""Love Bug"" virus arrived with the subject line ""I Love You"" and then asked users to open an attachment to receive a love letter, resulting in their computer being infected with a virus.Trojan e-mails may also pose as a virtual postcard, promise a funny joke in an attachment, or offer to install a virus sweeper for free. In general, do not open attachments from senders you do not recognize., If you use gmail, the means to report a scam is fairly straight forward.


Log into your gmail account and go to gmail's help forum. From there, click ""Security and Privacy."" On this page, there are links to report phishing e-mails and other scams.To report a scam, Google will have you fill out a form. You will enter your e-mail address, the e-mail address the scam was sent from, the header and subject line of the questionable e-mail, its content, and any additional information you feel is important. You can then submit the form. If necessary, a representative from google will follow up with you to ask any additional questions., Hotmail has a very simple means of dealing with scam e-mails. You simply forward any suspicious emails to the Hotmail abuse team.


When you receive when you suspect is a fraudulent e-mail, hit the ""Forward"" button.The address of Hotmail's abuse team is simply ""abuse@hotmail.com."" Forward the e-mail to this address and hotmail can deal with the issue from there., For Yahoo, you'll need to go through Yahoo's website to report fraudulent e-mails.


Log onto your Yahoo account and click ""Yahoo Account"" on the top of the page. From there, click ""abuse and spam.""Yahoo will offer a variety of categories to choose from, such as ""Report phishing"" and ""Received spam e-mail or IM message.""Select the category that is most relevant. You will be redirected to a form asking for basic information, such as your e-mail address, the address of the suspicious e-mail, and details about its contents, subject line, and header. Fill out this information to the best of your ability., If you're receiving scam e-mails on an e-mail address you use for work or school, report them to the IT department in addition to reporting them through the e-mail server itself. The IT department will know how to handle phishing scams and other frauds and should be able to identify the culprits. It's also possible your work or school is being specifically targeted by scammers. You should make sure that information is widely known to prevent people from falling victim to a scam.

, It's a good idea to report fraudulent e-mails to the general public and any law enforcement agencies that could help identify and stop the scammer. In addition to reporting a fraudulent e-mail to your e-mail provider, try the following routes.


Emailbusters.org will publicize frauds in order to make people aware of what messages to avoid or delete.Ip-Address-Lookup-V4 is a site that can find the sender's e-mail and IP address. This can help identify scammers.If the fraudulent e-mail is asking for banking or other personal information, you should report it to the FBI's Complaint Center. The proper authorities can find and penalize scammers. This minimizes the number of victims of fraud., One of the easiest ways to avoid fraud is to use a spam filter system in your e-mail. This means fraudulent e-mails will not go to your main inbox but will instead be redirected to a spam folder and eventually deleted.


The majority of e-mail applications and web mail services provide the option to filter spam. If you're unsure how to add a spam filter to your email, look through the ""Help"" or ""FAQ"" on the website or application.Some spam will still get through, even with the best filters. Do not assume, just because you have a spam filter, all your e-mails are safe. Remember how to spot phishing scams and other fraudulent e-mails., If you receive an e-mail from an individual or organization you are not familiar with, do not open it and certainly do not click any links or open any attachments provided. If you receive an e-mail that appears to be from an organization you are familiar with, do not open it if you did not request information from that organization or recently make an order, fill out a survey, or contact the organization in some way., Attachments are one of the easiest routes for viruses and malicious software to be uploaded on your computer. Be very careful about opening attachments.


In general, only open attachments from people you know. If you work in a field, such as publishing, where you may receive e-mail attachments from strangers make sure the e-mails are legitimate. Phony e-mails can be spotted by heavy grammatical errors, as they're often produced via a spambot and not a person., Antivirus software is a powerful means of protecting yourself from fraud.


If possible, find an antivirus software that updates on its own. Oftentimes, people accidentally forget to update so having automatic updates might better protect you against e-mail and fraud.Make sure any antivirus software you use has an email scanning system in place. This can help you avoid downloading attachments that contain viruses., The best protection against a scam is education. Know the policies of the companies you work with in regards to e-mail so you can better recognize phishing scams.


Most commercial banks have a strict policy against asking for personal information via e-mail. You're more likely to receive a phone call to confirm suspicious charges than an e-mail. If you receive an e-mail asking for personal information, phone your bank to confirm before filling out any online forms.Social media sites, like Facebook and Twitter, all have e-mail policies regarding your account's security. Familiarize yourself with these policies and know when and why an e-mail from Twitter or Facebook might be appropriate."

Travel in groups.,
Let people know where you're going.,
Consider carrying some personal defense.,
Learn to defend yourself confidently.",How to Be Safe2," When you're going out at night, even if you're just going around the corner, it's a good idea to carry some form of communication, so you'll be able to be in touch in an emergency. Make sure that you've got a fully-charged cellphone in your purse or in your pocket at all times.


If you have an iPhone, set it up so your phone can be tracked via your Apple account, should you lose it, or it should be stolen.
Sometimes, it's a good idea to keep your cellphone tucked away, unless you absolutely need to use it. If you've got the brand-new smartphone, it might be more attractive for muggers.

, It's always the best bet to stick with people when you're walking at night. Man or woman, young or old, you're safer if you've got some back-up. Don't walk late at night all by yourself.


If you must walk alone, stick to well-lit areas, using reliable routes and get where you're going as quickly as possible. Call someone to let them know your travel plans, as soon as possible.
If you go out drinking, make sure you get rides figured out before it gets late. If you end up downtown at 2am without a plan for getting home, you might end up in a sketchy situation.
Avoid neighborhoods with high crime rates. Generally, you can contact the census in your area to find out which areas of your town are statistically more dangerous than others. Avoid these areas when you're walking alone.

, Try to keep in touch when you go out. You don't need to make a big deal out of checking in periodically with someone, just to be on the safe side. Let a parent, a close friend, or some other loved one know where you are, where you're going, and when you're likely to be back. At the very least, you'll keep people from worrying about you.

, If you come across a disturbing text, don't reply, and tell a teacher immediately!

,, Pay attention during drills, and encourage your classmates to do the same.

Use your credit card.,
Take warning if wired transactions get a discount.,
Check the Refund and Repairs Policy.,
Face the fact that a replica is just a replica.,
Know your precious metals.,
Be aware that replica watches are not waterproof.,
Know what's real.,
Don't believe that what you see is what you get.,
Be location aware.",How to Protect Yourself from Replica Watch Websites," Not your debit card, but your credit card.


The only payment method you should use is credit card.This is the only payment option that protects you from Internet scams. Why? Because your bank has your back.
Usually, all banks have a period of 6 months or more from the initial transaction date when the customer can dispute the payment. Sure, it may take a while for your money to show up on your account, but it always does. This is also the reason why most replica companies offer a 6 months repairs warranty. They know that during this time the customer can make a chargeback if he isn't satisfied with the order. If you pay with any other form of payment, such as Bank Wire or COD then chances are that you won't get anything or you will get an inferior watch that will never be replaced or repaired.;
,


You will see that all Western Union or Bank Wire payments get an additional discount. This is because for a replica company, a Western Union or bank wire payment means no risks of a chargeback. They love this! If you don't like the replica or if it breaks then there is nothing that you can do except accept what ever solution they provide, if any.

,


Don't believe the old ""no questions asked, money back guarantee"" line.They will ask you tons of questions about what are your reasons for not being satisfied with the watch. If the reason is a defect, then they will request photos of this. And even if they accept your return, there are additional costs that you will have to pay, like the return shipping fees and a restocking fee. You will end up spending a lot of money and time on this.
Make sure it has a repairs warranty. A trustworthy company doesn't necessarily mean a good quality replica watch. Even if the fake watches website has the best intentions and provides the best services and guarantees, it may still end up delivering a faulty replica watch. This happens because the quality control of fake watches factories is very poor. As a result, buying again from a company that once sold you a perfect replica doesn't mean that you will get the same degree of quality. It's a game of chance. The only thing you can be certain of is that a decent store will always replace or repair a defective replica watch.

,


All replica companies will tell you that no one will be able to tell the difference between one of their replicas and the original watch. That's bogus! Of course, there are people who can tell the difference; people who know a thing or two about the authentic model. No matter how good the replica is, there are still some differences either at the outside or at the inside of the watch.

, Triple wrapped gold plated"" replica are not actually 18 k gold plated watches. These have only a regular gold paint that will start to fade of or discolor only a couple of months. If you want to buy a fake watch, then the safest thing to do is to buy a full stainless steel one.

, No fake watch is or will ever be waterproof. All of the more expensive replicas have a rubber seal around the winding crown and case, but water will still get in. Again, this is due to the poor quality control. Keep this in mind and do not even think about exposing your replica watch to water! This will damage the knockoff and the warranty does not cover any water damages.

, There is no such thing as Swiss or Japanese replicas. No part of any replica watch is manufactured in Switzerland or Japan. Any small piece of a fake is solely produced in China. The so called 'Japanese replicas' are the medium quality ones, the 'Swiss replica's are actually the replicas with a more durable and accurate movement- the best you can find in China.

, Many replica websites use pictures copied from different sites or pictures of the original products. Contact the customer service and ask them for an actual photo of their products, one taken in their factory or warehouse and not in a professional studio.

, If a replica watches store says that it ships packages from USA or UK, this is designed to make the company look good. Its factory and warehouse is in China and all the orders are dispatched from there.

Leave electrical cords alone. They can be a cause of fire.

, If it ever happened that your clothes caught on fire, it is important to practice this so that you will do it automatically:


Stop - stop screaming, crying and panicking
Drop - drop to the floor straight away
Roll - roll over and over to try to put out the flames

, If you are asleep or inside your house when a fire starts, there may already be thick, dark smoke when you try to get out. Get down low and crawl to get out. There is usually less smoke at the floor level.

Make sure to stick to the speed limit.,
Use common sense.,
Be courteous to other drivers.,
Don't drive under the influence of alcohol.,
Drive by yourself.,
Get into ""The Zone"" while driving.,
Turn off your cell phone.,
Have rules in your car.,
Remember the rules of the road.,
Take care of your vehicle.",How to Be a Safe Teenage Driver," Even if you are running late somewhere, don't speed. It's better to get to your destination a few minutes later than planned than to be in an accident. Not only could speeding cause an accident, but it could result in you getting a speeding ticket!;
, Wear your seat belt no matter what, and make sure not to get caught up in any distractions while driving, such as texting. If you really would like to do something, such as changing the radio station, wait until you are at a stoplight.

, If you see someone waiting to pull into traffic, let them in. Make sure if someone does the same for you, acknowledge it by a simple wave, a gesture that takes no energy on your part, but makes the other driver feel appreciated.

, It is illegal for you to drink, anyway. If you do drink, though, get a designated driver to drive you safely home.

, Drive solo rather than with friends in the car at first. It is easy to get distracted when your friends are talking to you or to each other. For the first couple months after you've got your license, you might want to stick to just one passenger. Then the more you get the hang of driving, the more friends that can ride in your car.


Some states in America have laws regarding the passengers of a car driven by a new driver. Make sure you are familiar with these laws.

, When driving a vehicle, drive the vehicle. Get rid of the distractions and focus on everything around you, yet have a clear mind. Focus only on the task at hand. Relax your body when behind the wheel instead of being tense and stressed. Enjoy the ride. Enjoy sitting in traffic. Live in that moment behind the wheel. Smile and know your safety comes first and know you will do anything to preserve that.

, Even if you have Bluetooth, it is very easy to get in a car crash when you are texting or calling your friends.


In some provinces in Canada, there are laws preventing the use of a cell phone while driving. Know if these laws apply to you.

, It's your car, and when your friends and family are riding in it, set some rules for them. Don't have them do drugs or abuse alcohol in your backseat. Don't let them be a distraction for you. If they are distracting you, either pull over and talk to them, warn them that if they continue you won't drive them anywhere, or pull over and politely ask them to leave the car. Setting rules like these will avoid clashes with the law, as well as unwanted accidents.

, Even if you do all of the above things, remember the rules of the road. Don't forget to put your turn signal on before turning, to check your blind spot, to look behind you before turning or merging, etc.

, Make sure to keep your vehicle in good running condition. Change your oil when it's due. Some people let their car go thousands of miles over the oil change date. It literally takes 10 minutes to pull through an oil changing station and most of the time you don't even have to get out of your car. Take care of your car, take care of yourself, and enjoy the privilege of driving.

Use generic photos and images.,
Choose an appropriate screen name.,
Avoid private conversations.,
Connect only with people you know in real life.,
Keep personal information off the internet.,
Become familiar with terms of service.",How to Protect Your Kids from Online Catfishing1," Kids and teenagers should be careful posting pictures of themselves online, because these images could open them up to predators and catfish. This is particularly important with images that are viewable by the general public.For example, your kids may use a picture of a pet or other animal, or a cartoon avatar, as a profile picture.
One tactic catfish use to get close to their victims is flattery in the form of compliments about how the person looks. If they don't know what your kids look like, they won't be able to get to them this way.
Check the privacy settings on your kids' social media accounts, and teach them how to manage their privacy if they want to post selfies or pictures with their friends. You can adjust the settings so that those types of pictures are only visible by close friends and family members, not the public or even ""friends of friends.""
Keep in mind that your kids' friends also may post pictures of them. Make sure they are at least receiving a notification when they are tagged in someone else's picture, so they have the option of removing the tag.;
, The best screen names for kids if you want to protect them from online catfishing should be impersonal and gender-neutral. Nothing in the screen name should reveal the child's real name, age, or location.You may want to create your kids' screen names for them, or help them choose one that they like. Make sure they understand what information cannot be in their screen name, and why.
Kids' screen names also shouldn't include anything that could be interpreted as suggestive. These kinds of screen names can attract predators, including catfish, who believe your kids are open to something they're not.
Avoid words such as ""girl,"" ""boy,"" ""darling,"" ""baby,"" ""cutie,"" ""princess,"" ""flower,"" ""fairy,"" and similar. Any numbers should be random – don't use a zip code, area code, or birth date, for example.

, Catfish are able to emotionally manipulate their victims because they get them alone. You can adjust your kids' privacy settings on their social media accounts so that they do not receive private messages from people they don't know.Explain to your kids the importance of not having private conversations with people they don't know in person, especially if they frequent chat rooms or play multiplayer video games in which the players interact with each other while playing the game.
Talking to strangers in a group situation is generally okay, because a catfish or other online predator isn't really going to make a move when there are other people who can observe the interaction.
However, they may still try to build up trust with your kids so they won't see anything wrong with having a private conversation. Tell your kids that if someone they don't know in real life asks to have a private conversation, they can simply say something like ""I'm sorry, I don't go private. Catch you later!"" They also can make up an excuse, although they need to understand that if they do that, the person probably will keep asking them.

, Encourage your kids to make social media connections with people they know and trust, but not with people they only know from online and have never met or interacted with in person.This means kids should be cautious with friends of friends as well. Sometimes a catfish finds a way into their victim's life because they actually do have a mutual friend. This mutual friend typically isn't aware of this person's online games. Since your kids see that they have a friend in common, they think it's okay to go ahead and connect with this person even though they don't know them in real life.
People you know in real life also can be deceptive and manipulative online. This is something to keep in mind if, for example, your kids get a friend request from someone who moved to a different part of the country and hasn't spoken to them in awhile.
A good basic rule to teach your kids is that if they get a friend request and their first reaction is ""Why?"" they probably should ignore that friend request.

, Often a catfish will read through their potential victim's profiles and posts to learn as much as they can about the person. The more information they have, the more potential weapons they have for their manipulation.Kids will be attracted to someone if they feel like they have a lot in common about that person, or if that person seems to really understand them. The way a catfish establishes this level of commonality and trust is to study their victim's social media profiles and then parrot back those things that they know are of interest.
It's often the case that your kids will forget things they've posted online after a few weeks or even a few days – especially if they are active online and post frequently. All of these old posts can be used as fodder by the catfish to establish things they have in common with your kids.
If there isn't a lot of personal information on your kids' social media accounts, a catfish won't have much to use and your kids won't be an easy target.

, Every social media website or app has a terms of service agreement to which you must agree before setting up an account on that site. While these agreements can be cumbersome to read through, understanding them is important.Generally, the terms of service spell out what behavior is and is not permitted by users of the app or website. If a user is violating the terms of service agreement, you can report it to the company that runs the website or app, and that user's account will be suspended.
Cyberbullying violates the terms of service of all major social media platforms, but proving that cyberbullying or catfishing is occurring to the point that the company will suspend the user's account is difficult.
Typically, the company will respond to your report by instructing that you or your kids should simply block this person so that they cannot access your kids' information or contact them. If you have already done this and the person is still harassing your kids, you may be able to spur the company to take further action.
Take note of the steps you must take to report a violation of the terms of service agreement, and the type of evidence you need to present. That way, if your kids are contacted by a catfish, you'll have the knowledge you need to protect them.

Tornado.,
Fire.,
Earthquake.,
Burglary.,
Car Wreck.,
Even though there are so many emergencies that can happen, you can always be prepared.",How to Be Prepared for Any Kind of Emergency (for Kids)," If you're at home and a meteorologist has warned you of a tornado in your area, take cover in the most safe place possible. If you have a storm cellar or safe room those are the safest places you could take shelter in. If you don't, make sure you're on the lowest level! If you have a basement go there, in a small corner, and protect yourself with something soft like a mattress or lots of blankets and pillows. If you don't have a basement go in a small bathroom or a closet (such as a coat or a linen closet) in the center of the lowest level of your home. Don't go in a room with windows! The windows could bust open and the wind would get in, that can hurt you! Again, protect yourself with a mattress or pillows and blankets. Keep a radio near-by at all times tuned on a station telling the weather. If you're home alone the least thing you want to do is panic. Do not wait around for your parents to come home, cause they're probably not going to if there is a tornado warning. Where ever you're taking cover, keep a phone with you! This way, if you keep trapped under debris you'll be able to call the Emergency Services for help. Don't leave your shelter until you know it is safe.;
, If you're at school your teacher should already have a plan. If he or she doesn't have your parents discuss the importance of a good fire escape plan. If you're at home make sure you also have a fire escape plan. That should Consist of 2 ways to get out of room in every part of the house. Every family should have at least 3 fire alarms!. But if you're in your room and all of a sudden you smell smoke, go to your door but don't open it. If possible, get a wet cloth (or a fire mask, if you have one) and put it over your nose and mouth. The chemicals in the smoke are dangerous, so if possible, GET A WET WASHCLOTH. Feel of the door to see if it is warm with the backside of your hand. If it is and you know there is a fire in your home, go to the biggest window in your room and open, or break open the screen (if your window has one). You can break it open by using a toy to bang on it with, or just punching through and pulling it apart. If you're room is on the second floor, keep an escape ladder handy. These ladders are made of rope and wood and fold up so you can keep it near by. Carefully escape and run as far away from the house as possible (staying in your yard).

, Earthquakes have only two ways of easy survival. One: run under a sturdy table, where there are no objects to fall on you or the table. Or run to the doorway and stand straight and still. Don't move around! The more you move the better chance you have of getting hurt badly. Open fields, and (some might argue) limestone caves are the best places to be during an earthquake. Open fields rarely have fault lines, and there's nothing to fall on you. The cave theory is disputed, but the theory is: that you can shake it as much as you want, but the hole in the rock stays the same. Limestone is the strongest sedimentary rock.

, Most homes now have security systems. A security system is something that automatically contacts someone for help and makes a loud noise when someone breaks in. They have saved many lives, but then again not everyone. If someone breaks in you'll either see them, hear gun shots, yelling, or movement. Or you won't see them at all. If you see them and they don't see you, be as quiet as possible! If you think you can, sneak off the other direction and hide under your bed, cover your self up with a blanket, or climb to the top shelf on your closet. Anywhere you think you'll be safe until help arrives. Keep a cell phone with you at all times - even at home. Immediately call Emergency Services! The longer you wait, the longer it will take. Just remember, stay quiet and calm. Don't cry or they'll hear you. Just think good thoughts and know that you're going to be okay.

, Car wrecks can happen so fast! That's why you need to be prepared! If a wreck happens, try to get out of the car (unless you absolutely can't), and if possible, call the Emergency Services. If you're stuck and you can't, let someone know that you're still alive. Say something like, ""Help,"" or ""I'm alive,"" as loud as possible. When emergency arrives, it may hurt when they pick you up. Remember they're there to help you and you're going to be okay. Stay as calm as you can the whole ride to the hospital and let them do whatever they have to do in order for you to survive. The EMTs will help you get better, so don't be afraid.

, Through any emergency always stay calm. It always pays to be prepared!

What comprises a typical day of eating for you?
What are the snacks that you eat during the day? What meals do you eat in the cafeteria?;
, Check the food’s nutritional label or use calorie estimating app to help you get an idea. This is well help you gauge whether you are taking in too many or too few calories. It is important to remember that, depending on your activity level, body size, growth rate, and gender, the number of daily calories needed will vary., Use a scientific calorie calculator to see how many calories your body needs to maintain or lose weight. For healthy function, and long-lasting dieting results, your body needs enough calories to sustain the calories burned throughout the day. The calories you take in need to equal the calories you burn. Check with your doctor if you are unsure of how many calories your body burns.As a teen with a demanding schedule and growing body, this is especially important. Caloric intake depends on a person’s activity levels, which is considered by the calorie calculator.
Teen boys require an average of 2,800 calories per day, while teen girls require 2,200. Getting enough calories is essential to teen growth and development.For teens, the amount of calories needed increases by 200 each year. The peak requirement may be up to 3,200 calories between the ages of 16 and 18 years old if you are very active., You want to create a balanced diet, so keep in mind the five food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy. Notice patterns, such as if you consume a high amount of grains, but see that there are few protein foods listed.Do you notice a balance, or is one group more skewed than others are?
Write down which groups are lacking in your current eating regimen.

, Limit unhealthy foods by replacing sugary drinks like soda, artificial juice, and sports drinks with water. If you eat a lot of processed and pre-packaged foods, replace them with fresh produce, protein, nuts for snacking, and foods rich in healthy fats, like avocados. , Because your body is undergoing many physical changes, it requires larger amounts of certain vitamins and minerals. Emphasize foods that will help you meet your daily needs.Teens need between 45 and 60 grams of protein a day, whether from meat, fish or dairy. The densest sources of protein include: beef, chicken, turkey, pork, fish, eggs, cheese. Nutritionists recommend that that complex carbs make up 50%-60% of a teenager's caloric intake. A few examples of complex carbs are: sweet potatoes, whole grains, oatmeal, corn, lentils, and beans. They offer a lot of substance but contain little fat. Dietary fat should be limited to 30% of the diet. However, it is important to consume healthy fats because fats supply energy, essential fatty acids, and aid in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Teens who eat a fat-heavy diet filled with lots of fatty, greasy, and/or fried foods will gain weight, even with an active lifestyle and workout plan., Avoid artificial ingredients such as preservatives and synthetic chemicals. Emphasize unpackaged items and fresh produce. Go shopping with your parents or send them a grocery list in order to ensure that you get the healthy foods you want. Shop the periphery of the grocery store, where natural produce and unpackaged items are located.
Choose short ingredients list with names that you can pronounce and recognize, this suggests that the food is minimally processed.

, Teenagers need 60 minutes of physical activity every day. You can get this by taking Physical Education (PE) or participating in a sport. You can also do things like walking or riding your bike places. Being active will help you control your weight and improve your overall health.Join a club sport or the local YMCA. If you cannot afford those, try borrowing equipment from a friend or neighbor. Your school might even let you check out certain items.
In addition to controlling your weight, incorporating more physical activity into your daily routine has the power to boost energy, combat health conditions, and improve your overall mood., Find an activity that you particularly enjoy and see how long you can do it. It is likely that the time will fly by if you are doing something that you enjoy because you will not be thinking of it as exercise. This can be shooting hoops, riding your bike or dancing to your favorite music.If you are unsure what activities you like, try out different things. You will not know what you like until you try it.

, Participation in psychical activities as a part of a group can be fun and help you get your daily exercise. You can join a team sport, shoot hoops with your friends, go on a hike with your family, or search for Pokémon in your local park.


Be sure to find people who are encouraging and supportive. Their positivity will help you reach your goals.

, As a teenager, you can have many commitments and it can be difficult to make time for exercise. The best way to maintain a physically active lifestyle is to develop and maintain a routine. This does not mean that you have to do the same activities every day at the same time. It simply means setting aside a certain period of your day for exercise or sticking with daily habits. Find the things that will help motivate you and give you enough time to stay active. If you decide to walk to school, be intentional about walking as many days as you can and not catch a ride.
If you are not a morning person, exercise in the afternoon if you feel more motivated at that time.
Joining a sports team or club will help you develop a routine. Daily practices will help you better schedule your physical activity. Plus, being part of a team will help hold you accountable.

, Try keeping a journal of your physical activity. Write down what you did and for how long. This will help you get a better idea of how active your and areas for improvement.You can also use an activity tracker or app, which will track and record your exercise for you. , Forming new habits are a matter of repetition, and if you push past the first few difficult days you are sure to notice how much easier it is to keep up your change in diet and exercise. You will likely notice that you have more energy, too!Manage your expectations and focus on consistency instead of getting fast results.

, Taking a rest day is essential to your workouts paying off and shaping your body. Your body will need days to rest between intense exercises. You will also have days where it is difficult for you to stick to your healthy eating habits. Do not beat yourself up on these days and instead embrace them as opportunities to indulge and relax.


Rest days keep you from burning out in your exercise routine and refreshes your desire to workout.
Pick one time a week to enjoy a soda or your favorite junky snack, but keep it in moderation.

, Quality sleep is also essential for teens to see the progress of your workout and dieting. Teenagers should get 8 to 10 hours of sleep a night. Although it may be tempting to stay up late playing video games or socializing with your friends, getting enough is vitally important for having the energy to stay active and eat healthy.Although you may be too old for a bedtime, going to bed at the same time every night will help you develop a good sleep routine. Try to find a time that works for you and stick with it.

, Time constraints and the social pressure to conform to a certain body type can make skipping meals look like an appealing option for teenagers. However, this throws off your metabolism and can lead to increased weight gain. This is a reason why crash dieting is unsustainable and usually followed by quick weight gain. It can also lead to eating disorders and other unhealthy habits. Keep a steady and consistent eating schedule to make sure that you are not depriving your body of essential nutrients.
Always eat breakfast. This is the most important meal of the day because it gets your metabolism going, which results in more calories burned, and helps you have more energy.

, While sugary drinks such as soda are hazardous to health, water supports your body functioning optimally, including losing weight. Oftentimes, your body’s signals for wanting more water can be mistaken for hunger. Teenagers should drink 6 to 8 glasses of water a day.Drinking enough water every day will help you feel full and prevent unnecessary snacking and eating when you are not hungry.

, There is a difference between wanting to attain a healthy weight and having an unhealthy fixation on weight loss. For teens, social media and societal pressures can be a huge source of anxiety surrounding weight loss. If you feel that your eating and exercise habits are becoming a preoccupation in your life, seek support in figuring out how to address these habits. Untreated eating disorders can lead to significant medical complications. Support can be found in professionals such as a medical doctor, psychologist and/or therapist, dietician, or physical therapist.
Group support can be a huge motivator and source of accountability in reaching your goals. Group coaching is available both online and can oftentimes be found locally in your city., Every day, say a positive affirmation in the mirror, ""I am healthy and beautiful. I love me and who I'm becoming.” It may sound corny, but taking on a healthy lifestyle is a huge accomplishment in itself, and you should own that!


Positive affirmations are said to help in establishing a brighter, “can-do” mindset, which will make accomplishing your dieting goals that much easier.Dieting takes a lot of willpower, so make sure you reward yourself. Create a positive incentive, like your weekly portion-controlled favorite snack, to look forward to after completing all of your work outs.

Stay calm.,

Wait for the all-clear.",How to Act During a Fire Drill," Do not panic when you hear the alarm. Also, it's important to stay quiet so you can hear any instructions.


In fact, it's important to be quiet and calm the whole time the fire drill is happening, not just when it starts.;
, Though you may think the fire alarm is just for practice, you should always treat it as there actually is a fire. You have to practice the drill seriously to learn the proper procedure so that when a fire does happen, you won't panic.In fact, even if a drill is scheduled, something could have happened to cause a real emergency. Always treat the drill as if it were the real thing.

, When you hear the alarm, you must stop anything you are doing at the time. Don't take time to finish a sentence on your paper or send an email. Don't take time to gather your things. Respond to the alarm immediately., Consider where the nearest exit is. Leave the room you are in going in that direction.Try to be as orderly as possible as you leave the room. Line up to exit the room. Don't start running.
If possible, know the route before a fire drill happens. It's always a good idea to check for your route when you're in a new building, especially one you will spend a good deal of time in. For instance, hotels are required to have the fire exit on the back of your hotel door.
Under no circumstances should you ever use an elevator in an emergency evacuation.

, If you are the last person in a room, close the door behind you. Make sure it doesn't lock, however.When you close the door, it helps slow the fire because not as much oxygen can get in the room as quickly. It also blocks smoke and heat from entering other rooms as much., Do not turn the lights off as you exit the room. Leaving the lights on will help firefighters see better., Go along the prescribed route for evacuating the building. If you don't know where the nearest exit is, look for ""Exit"" signs as you move down the hallways. These signs will usually be in red and sometimes will be lighted., When you're in a real fire, you must check doors for heat as you come up to them. Look for smoke coming under the door, and place your hand near the door to see if it is radiating heat. If you see neither of these signs, try lightly touching the door handle to see if it is hot. In a real fire, if you find any of these signs, you must go another route., You should not use elevators during a fire drill. During a real fire, elevators are used by the firefighters to help fight the fire. Plus, elevators can be dangerous during a fire.In addition, stairways are usually pressurized, meaning they will not be as smoky as other areas., Sometimes, the people doing the drill will put up ""smoke"" signs in certain hallways to simulate what happens in a real fire. If you see a smoke sign, you need to find an alternative route out of the building.


If that's the only way out, practice crawling low. When there's smoke, getting down low can help you see better., Make sure to leave the sidewalks clear for the firefighters to do their work. If there are too many people clumped on the sidewalks, firefighters cannot get through.Be sure to listen for people in authority giving directions. Teachers or your bosses will likely be looking to take a head count, so they will want to get everyone in the same area, which is why it's important to stay quiet.

, If there really is a fire, the building could eventually collapse. You should move a safe distance away from the building. Generally, across the street is fine., Don't assume that because the fire alarm has stopped, you can re-enter the building. Wait until the firefighters or someone else in charge tells you it's fine to go back inside. Once you hear that, you can resume normal activities."

Keep the computer in a common area of the house.,
Maintain parental controls.,
Review your kids' browsing history.,
Check your kids' mobile devices regularly.,
Set limits for internet time.,
Use a family email address.,
Make a list of the websites and apps your kids use.",How to Protect Your Kids from Online Catfishing2," Your kids will be less inclined to engage in online behavior they know you wouldn't approve of if their only opportunity to use the computer is when everything they are doing is visible to you and other members of the household.However, don't forget that kids can access the internet in other ways, such as if they have their own smart phone or tablet.

, Parental control software can help you monitor what your kids are doing on the internet as well as adjust the user settings on the computer to ensure that your kids are protected and can't access harmful things.Most parental control software comes with basic filtering to block objectionable or adult content, as well as blocks that limit your kids' ability to share personal or private information on the internet.
You also can install software that limits the amount of time your kids' can be on the internet and the time of day the internet is available. At any other time, the computer will be offline and the kids will be unable to access the internet. This works well with younger kids, but may not be all that beneficial for teenagers who have mobile devices with internet access.
You also can use monitoring parental control tools, even without the kids' knowledge. These tools simply record all the sites the kids visit and what they do there, and may send you a notification if they access certain types of sites or engage in activities you specify.

, To appropriately monitor what your kids are doing online, you'll want to adjust the administrative settings on the computer the kids use so that they are not permitted to delete their browser history, cache, or cookies.Reading through the browser history will tell you the sites that your kids visited, how many times they went there, and generally what they looked at while they were there.
This level of monitoring doesn't just help protect your kids from online catfishing, it also ensures that they aren't doing anything else harmful online, such as downloading a virus.
You also may want to create user settings for them that do not permit them to download anything from the internet or install any apps or programs on the computer.

, If your kids have a smart phone or tablet, they also may be online or using social media there. To protect your kids from online catfishing, you need to have access to all devices on which they access the internet.If you can, set up your kids' mobile devices so that they sync with a main computer. That way you can check everything all at once rather than having to check each device, which can seem intrusive to your kids.
Adjust the user settings on your kids' smart phones and tablets so that they can't delete or manipulate data, or download apps, such as chat apps, without your knowledge and permission.

, Limiting the amount of time your kids can spend on the computer is as much about ensuring they have a healthy, well-rounded lifestyle as it is protecting them from online predators and catfishing.You also want to make sure that your kids aren't on the internet for extended periods of time, particularly late at night, when many catfish choose to lurk about online.
For example, you may allow your kids 20 minutes of free time to use the internet each night. Particularly if they have a lot of different sites they like to visit, 20 minutes isn't really enough time for them to start a relationship with someone or become vulnerable to catfishing.

, Help your kids set up their social media accounts, and set them up with an email address that you can access. This way you can also set up the notifications so that you receive an email alert when someone tries to contact your kids.Older teenagers may have a problem with this, because they feel that you are spying on them and not giving them enough privacy. Explain that you are only trying to protect them and keep them from harm, but give them as much privacy as you feel comfortable doing while still keeping them safe.
Keep the lines of communication open, and ensure that your kids feel comfortable coming to you if they have any issues online, or if someone online is making them uneasy. Let them know that you won't be angry with them, that you only care for their safety and security.

, You can't monitor your kids' internet usage if you don't know where they are when they go online. Keep a master list of their social media profiles, and update it regularly.You may want to limit your kids' access to certain types of websites or apps, particularly those that have a reputation as being a place for people to ""hook up."" Even if your kids don't intend to use them that way, other people do, and they may assume that your kids are looking for the same thing.
Older teenagers may want a little more privacy, but with younger kids, your master list should include all of the passwords to their accounts so that you can access them if you need to.

Use a reverse image search.",How to Protect Your Kids from Online Catfishing3," Because kids can be very trusting, make sure they understand that even someone who seems perfectly nice could also be lying to them. If they don't already have a personal relationship with the person, there's little reason to connect with them online.If you're monitoring your kids' social media and internet usage, you can ask them about their friends. If you don't recognize the name (say, as someone you know your kids are friends with at school), ask them how they know the person. If they say they only know them through online interaction, you can press more about how their relationship developed.
Avoid being accusatory, and tell your kids that you aren't mad at them. You simply want to make sure that they're safe, and that they're making responsible choices about their online activities.
You also want to let your kids know that if they ever have any questions or problems with someone, or if someone online makes them uncomfortable, they should immediately cease communication with that person and block them. Make sure they understand that they don't owe anybody time or attention online for any reason.

, If you suspect that someone your kids are interacting with online is a catfish, you may be able to find hints of this by looking at that person's social media profiles. Check both on the site where your kids met them as well as elsewhere on the internet.Some catfish are very elaborate, and have multiple profiles across many different apps and sites. Some are only on one site, and you can't find any trace of them anywhere else online.
Often a catfish's profile will be relatively new, and may have few friends. They also may have tons of friends, but there never seems to be any personal interaction, or none of these people seem to know the person in real life.
You also should watch out for vague profiles, or profiles in which all of the pictures are selfies. Real people typically will have at least a few pictures of themselves with friends or family – a catfish typically won't have any pictures like this.

, When your kids get a friend request or other contact online from someone they don't know in real life, they should automatically figure out if this person also is friends with anyone else that they know personally.If there are mutual friends, you or your kids can talk to those people and find out more about this person. Ask them if they know the person in real life, if they've ever met them, and what they're like.
If there's a mutual friend who does know the person in real life, find out how they met the person, how well they know them, and how long they've known them. You also might want to try to find out why this person wants to be friends online with your kids when they don't personally know them.
Keep in mind that there might be an innocent explanation. For example, it could be that the person is going to be switching to your kids' school next year, and wants to get to know some of their classmates in advance. However, it still pays to do your homework if you want to protect your kids from online catfishing.

, Commonly used search engines all have a function you can use to search by image rather than by using key words. This type of search can be an easy way to quickly identify a catfish.Simply copy or save the suspicious person's profile picture, and maybe a few other photos from their profile. Then drop them into the search engine and check the results.
For a catfish who is using fake images, you typically will find another social media account or website with the same pictures prominently displayed. Catfish typically don't go to great lengths to find fake images to use. They may even be using pictures of a model or celebrity.
If you determine that the person is using fake pictures, talk to your kids about it and present the evidence to them. Suggest that they block this person from their social media accounts, and let them know that you are there to support them.

Every day, you should try to eat food from all of the main food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and dairy.Your exact nutritional needs will depend on many factors, including your age, your weight, and your activity level. You can visit choosemyplate.gov to find out how much of eat food group the United States Department of Agriculture recommends for someone like you.;
, Empty calories come from foods that are high in calories, but low in nutrition. Try to avoid processed foods and foods that have added sugars.


Keep in mind that you get calories from drinks too. Cutting out soda and other sugary drinks from your diet can help you lose weight.
Full-fat dairy and fatty meats are also sources of empty calories. Swapping them out for low-fat dairy and lean meats will help you reduce your calorie intake, while still providing you with beneficial nutrients and allowing you to enjoy the same volume of food.

, It's important to provide your body with regular nourishment. If you skip meals, you won't have as much energy. You may also disrupt your body's natural metabolism, which can make it more difficult to maintain a healthy weight., Exercise is a vital component to a healthy lifestyle.Try playing a sport at school to keep you active. If competitive sports aren't for you, do something more independent, like jogging, riding your bike, or practicing yoga. If you're not used to exercise, start small. Going for a short walk is a great place to start. You can also do simple exercises, like sit-ups and push-ups, at home while you're watching television. Ideally, you should aim for 60 minutes of exercise each day if you want to lose weight. It doesn't have to be 60 consecutive minutes, so feel free to break it up into smaller increments.
For the best results, incorporate at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of intense aerobic exercise into your weekly routine. Moderate aerobic exercise can include activities like power walking or swimming. Intense aerobic exercise includes activities like running or dancing.It's also important to do some strength training in order to keep your muscles toned as you lose weight. Lifting free weights, using weight machines, or even lifting heavy objects while working outside all count as strength training., It's great that you want to get healthy, but try not to compare yourself to others or set unrealistic goals for your weight loss. People who have a positive self-image are better able to stick to healthy habits.To help maintain a positive body image, try reminding yourself every day about all of your positive traits, both physical and otherwise. It's also important to avoid people who have unhealthy relationships with food and to understand that the media often portrays women's bodies in a very unhealthy way.Think about consulting a doctor, wellness coach, or nutritionist to help you lose weight in a healthy way. A professional can help you analyze your habits, find out what's holding you back, and make sure you're not jeopardizing your health in any way.Get immediate help if you start to exhibit any signs of an eating disorder, such as having obsessive thoughts about food, practicing food rituals, severely restricting your calorie intake, exercising excessively, or binging and purging., Foods like watermelon, cucumber, lettuce, and broths contain a lot of water and relatively few calories. If you eat these foods before your main meal, they may satisfy you enough to prevent you from overeating.You can also try drinking water shortly before your meal. Sometimes your body mistakes thirst for hunger.

, You may feel hungry if your body is craving nutrients, so it's important to see your doctor regularly and get periodic lab work to check for deficiencies. If you do have a vitamin deficiency, take the recommended supplements every day., If you never allow yourself to enjoy food, you're more likely to give up on your healthy habits altogether. The key is to allow yourself to indulge in small amounts of the foods you crave every so often., Instead of eating until you can't possibly eat any more, try to be more mindful and put the fork down as soon as you stop feeling hungry.Make sure you don't eat too fast, or you might not realize that you have had enough.
It's also important to make sure you are actually hungry before you start eating. Try to recognize if you are eating for emotional reasons, or just because you're bored. Once you recognize it, try to replace your snacking with a healthier alternative. Going for a walk can be a great distraction!

, Try to always be conscious of how much you are eating. Instead of eating your snack out of the bag and losing track of how much you've consumed, place an appropriate portion on a plate and then put the bag away., When you put an outfit together, try to think about balancing your upper and lower halves. If you are more bottom-heavy, draw attention to the upper half of your body with bright colors or bold prints. If you're more top-heavy, do the opposite., Shoes with pointy toes and narrow heels will make your legs look longer and slimmer.This effect is even more pronounced if you wear heels that are the same color as your skin.

, If you want to draw attention away from a specific part of your body, wear articles of clothing that highlight other sections. For example, you could wear a top that displays your neck and collarbone in order to bring attention up to your face and away from the lower half of your body.To avoid drawing unwanted attention to your midsection, avoid stark color contrasts between your top and your bottom. (This includes belts.)

, If you have some bulges you'd like to hide, invest in some high quality spandex shapewear. These are discreet undergarments that hug you in and make you look instantly slimmer, and they come in styles for all different body types., Plain, straight-legged or boot-cut jeans in a dark wash are the most slimming. Avoid styles with embellishments., Make sure your clothes are not creating unnecessary bulk, but are also not clinging to your every curve.If you're wearing one very tight article of clothing, make sure everything else is a bit looser.
Avoid sagging and bulging by making sure your underwear fits properly too.

, If you want your face to look slimmer, avoid short and stick-straight hairstyles. Long locks that have some waves or curls to them will give you the illusion of a slimmer face.Highlights may also help your face look slimmer.

, If you want your face to look instantly slimmer, try applying a bronzer to your cheek bones and under your jaw line. The contrast will help accentuate your natural bone structure.If you want to look slimmer in a bathing suit, you can also get a body contouring spray tan. By strategically applying different shades, the technician can make your whole body look slimmer. Call local tanning salons in your area to see if they offer this service.

Understand why it's there.,
Don't complain or curse.,
Talk about time restrictions.,
Don't try to disable the software.,
Just brush it off if your friends notice.",How to Live with Parental Control Software if You're a Teenager," Your parents installed this because they love you and care for you. They know that the internet has its dangers and you need to be protected. It isn't just porn or drugs, although a third of all internet downloads involve pornography and there are 4.2m porn websites out there.One big concern is potentially abusive or ill-intentioned individuals lurking on dating sites or social media, often pretending to be someone they're not. Cyberbullying is a real threat, too - one on four teenagers has experienced repeated bullying via their phone or PC.Teenage girls from 15 to 19 are the most vulnerable because they spend a lot of time online and are the key target for these dangerous individuals.;
, See it from their point of view and instead discuss the level of protection you need. Most parental control software blocks websites using a list of banned terms. Discuss how they have configured this for you if you think it is too strict – and be prepared to give reasons why. If sites you need to visit are being blocked, ask for them to be whitelisted so the software will always allow access. Engaging with your parents will impress them; you are showing that you understand and accept why they installed parental controls and why you benefit from it.


Some parental control software, such as the ones automatically installed on Macs, will just automatically block any non-whitelisted website, and may even go to the extremes of blocking search engines such as Google. If this is the case of the parental control software you're dealing with, try asking if a different software can be used. If your parents are hesitant to agree, point out the amount of websites you visit that'll have to be whitelisted, and they may be more tempted to listen to you!

, Most software also controls how long you can be online and many parents use it to log you off at a given time to stop you from staying up too late. They have a point – like most teenagers, you probably don't get enough sleep! Again – negotiate. If you accept an earlier logoff time and bedtime during the week will they adjust the times at the weekend?


Some parental control software can be glitchy. If your parents have installed time restraints on your computer, there is a known issue with the Apple parental controls on Mac where the user is prevented from logging on at any point, even if the permitted time to use the computer is not used up or the log-off time has not occurred yet. If you get this issue often, try asking your parents about using a different software.

, The internet is awash with pages explaining how to do this. But if your parents have installed it properly, and you don't have administrator rights on your PC, it is very hard anyway. Additionally, the attempt will be logged, so they will know if you try to disable the software, and your parents will lose their trust in you - and you'll probably lose your phone and PC, too.

, Software versions for smartphones sometimes make it very obvious that you have parental controls installed. This can be embarrassing, especially when you're an older teen, as your friends are certain to realize. Resist the temptation to complain about your parents in this situation; it'll just end up making you more upset. Instead, explain that they feel it makes you safer online and that you think it's a good idea too. You can then crack a joke or change the subject.

Just like when you walk in the door of a social event, you want to get a feel for the place and how the people are interacting. You can tell from the comment conversations if these people will be ones you can relate to or not.Some online communities require that you sign up before you can read the boards or comments. You can do a little research about websites by reading reviews or reading on the website itself to see if you think it would be a good match for your personality.;
, Once you’re signed up on a website, it’s time to find users you think might make good friends for you. The easiest place to start is identifying others who share your interests. If you see a comment someone left about how much they love soccer or baking, and you love that thing too, you may want to pursue friendship with that person.


You can contact them immediately using the methods the website provides (such as clicking on their username to open a chat, or clicking “new message” by their name).
You can also copy and paste their name somewhere on your computer (or write it down) so that you can message them later when you feel more comfortable.

, Even though you’ll likely want to join more than one website—which means you’ll be setting up several user accounts—you want to be able to remember them all. Creating a username that you can use across all the websites is useful for this. You may have to tweak the name for different sites, but in general the similar name will prevent you from getting confused.

If a website already has a user with the name you picked out, adding a number, letter, or special character can usually allow you to still the use the name. For example, myrajane might be in use, but myra_jane might be available.
Use a different password for each site to protect your identity.
Create a file on your computer (such as Word or Excel) and save all the username/password combinations so that you don’t have to keep resetting the password.

, In addition to private-messaging (PMing) users you think you’d get along with, you can start commenting on threads already present. This way others will see your interests and may contact you first.

Make intelligent, unbiased comments so that you garner favor among commenters. Jumping in with a strong opinion or judgmental comment will most likely polarize the other commenters and contribute to your bad reputation on that site.

, Some online communities have introduction message boards. You can type up a couple of brief paragraphs with your name, location (just your city or state, nothing specific), age, gender, and a few interests. This information will provide a way for other users to connect with you. For example, someone from the same city or age group may be excited to contact you.

You can also find other users with your interests by scanning this board.

, If you want to start relationships with users who have specific interests, but you don’t want the bias already present on other message boards, starting your own group or message board might be the way to go. You can attract other users to join this group by commenting about it on similar threads.

, An easy way to make friends is to play online video games. A lot of online games today have a vocal component, so that you are playing the game and talking to other users at the same time. You can build relationships verbally rather than via text through games like Minecraft, Call of Duty, and many more.

Since you can join teams in video games, this often contributes to the creation of tighter bonds because you are working together toward a common goal.
Be aware that starting your own team and recruiting people to join it might create hostility in a game, so try to wait until people are interested and agreeable before starting your new team.

, Maintaining the norm for typing helps people like you since this standard is widely understood, even internationally. Using all caps, or a mix of uppercase and lowercase, or fancy scripts, is difficult to read and makes you seem pretentious or needy if no one else is doing this.

This can make it look like you are trying to draw attention to yourself, which works online just as it does in person: it usually pushes people away. This is because it suggests that you are unable to take care of yourself.Avoid “text talk” like using numbers to abbreviate a word (l8er, for example) as it appears unprofessional and lazy, not to mention being difficult to read.

, In your comments, don’t be biased or rude. Although you want to be able to express yourself, jumping into a conversation with your guns blazing makes people want to get away from you, especially if they disagree. Instead, maintain a polite and kind demeanor—even when you do disagree—to avoid polarizing the conversation and losing friends before you even start.

Save your passionate opinions for a one-on-one chat with someone who agrees, or for forums specifically designated as a space for debate.
Don’t personally attack anyone. Online spaces are just as particular about this as real-life places. This fact is easy to forget on online, where you aren’t seeing people’s body language.

, To get to know people, you want to show interest in their lives just like in real life. Show interest by asking pertinent questions that aren’t awkward or embarrassing to answer. You may find that they ask you questions in return.

Just like in real life, listening is a key for making online friendships.Be open about your life when you are asked questions, because just like in real life, being shy will push most people away. You can’t build a friendship if there isn’t both give and take.

, Once you have established a solid rapport with someone and feel that they are a safe friendship, you may want to exchange email addresses. This is especially useful if you are going to be out of touch (except through email) on a trip., Just like in real life, you have to communicate with people in order to stay friends with them. This means replying to messages, to posts, and asking questions and making inquiries about people before they ask you. This is called pursuing friendships.Reply to messages promptly. If you wait days or week to respond, you risk losing an online friendship, as it makes you look disinterested or too busy.

, Not only should you PM (private message) other users on a regular basis, but commenting in forums and threads keeps you current with friends. It also keeps your name in front of them so that you don’t get forgotten.

Tag others in your comments to include them, share ideas, and encourage conversation.

, If your friendship is going well and you have made sure that someone is safe, you may want to consider talking on the phone. Although this mode of communication is already in place for most online gaming, not so for most websites. Phone chats are fun because they make communication instant, deepening your friendship.

Think about meeting in real life, but only if you have already talked on the phone or through video chat to verify their identity. Take your time getting to the point of meeting in real life.Both phone chats and real-life meetings are normal parts of online dating sites.

, Conflict with online friends is inevitable, just like it is in real life. And just like real life, you want to deal with it so that your reputation doesn’t become tarnished with other users. Ask to PM or video/phone chat a friend in order to deal with the conflict, rather than trying to work it out in a public forum or slowly over email.

It is recommended that you take some time to cool off before trying to work through a conflict with an online friend, as well as discuss the situation with someone else to gain perspective., You can often sense when an online interaction is unsafe by paying attention to the way a person phrases things. If they keep pressuring you to give personal information, payment information, or your specific location, this is a red flag. You can also sense if someone is lying about their identity by the way to they talk about their profession or school environment, especially if you are very familiar with it.

For example, if someone says they are 16 but consistently uses the vocabulary of a college student; or if someone says they are from the UK but consistently uses American turns of phrase.
Leave a chat if you feel uncomfortable. There is no rule that says you can’t simply close out of a chat or delete an email without any explanation. Doing so is wise if you ever feel the slightest bit uncomfortable.

, Even though plenty of people lie about their age in order to access particular websites or deceive people for personal gain, plenty of others are honest about their age. Do your best to strike up friendships with people from your age group so that you aren’t encouraged to do something that is dangerous for your age.

For example, if you are 16 and you chat with someone who says they are 25, the 25-year-old might want to talk about things that are illegal for your age, like smoking and drinking. Talking about things like this can make you want to do them in order to impress your friend, but this is unwise since it can get you put in juvenile incarceration.

, You may want to share your school, state, province, county, or city in an online community in order to find friends who also live there or have visited, but don’t share your address. This is a good rule of thumb that can prevent you from accidentally telling a predator where you are located.

Ask external websites to take down your address, like WhitePages.com, so that others can’t search for your name on the internet and find out where you are.
Set all your profiles to private so that you aren’t sharing your contact details with everyone.

, Try not to use your actual name—at least not your last name or surname—so that others can’t find your details in an internet search. Instead, try to make a username out of an activity or show that you enjoy, like soccergirl or Sherlock_fan.

Likewise for your profile picture, use a non-descript profile image or avatar. Don’t use an actual picture of yourself, but instead upload an image of nature or your favorite movie character. You can also create an avatar on the internet to place in profile picture slots., If someone asks you for money through an online community, this is a red flag that you are dealing with a spammer or identity thief. Always refuse to pay for anything, especially if they ask for a card number or bank account number.

Do not share any type of payment information. PayPal may be ok, but make sure there is a real website that you are submitting to, if they are asking on behalf of a company or organization.
Avoid lending money in general to someone you have met online, as this can lead to a security breach.
You also don’t want to reveal that you can be pressured into giving money, because if you will give a little, you might give a lot, placing you in a situation where you might be repeatedly pressured for money.

, Absolutely never give out personal details like your social security number, birthdate, and passport number, as these are what people can use to steal your identity. Studies show that most teenagers are pretty good about protecting their personal info and keeping their profiles set to private, and everyone should follow their example.Avoid describing your appearance online as well.

, If you do decide to set up a phone or video chat, be very sure that the person you have agreed to talk to is a real person and not a spammer or predator. You can look for signs of online predators like these:Has a lot of activity with children on their accounts
Asks questions about who you are wanting to talk to
Appears to be a respected member of society
Excessively flatters, compliments, and affirms
Tries to turn you against people you trust like your parents or spouse
Makes threats

, If you have vetted an online friend thoroughly, including having had both phone and video chats to confirm they are not a predator, you may want to meet them in real life. If you do decide to meet, make sure to do so in a busy public place (like a mall or subway station) and take someone with you who can protect you, like a parent or older sibling, even an older friend.

It is helpful if the person with you knows personal defense skills or has a reputation for identifying compromising situations or dangerous people.

, There are many general interest websites that are tailored to different demographics, such as academics, comics, instant messengers, virtual realities, art, and so on. Most of these sites have forums that you can comment on. There are also websites that are strictly discussion boards. Some examples of these sites include:

DeviantArt
Penny Arcade
LambdaMOO
Wikihow
Wikipedia
Second Life
Friendsies
FriendMatch

, You can also find friends when you take online classes. Most online classes require participation on discussion boards, which allows you to get to know other like-minded students. The online forums for these classes also allow you to access student emails so that you can communicate outside of class.

Most colleges and universities now have online counterparts to their on-campus courses, so search your campus website.

, By now, social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram are household names. Most of the “friends” people have on these sites are people they know in real life, but that doesn’t mean strangers can’t add each other as “friends.” In fact, teenagers say they find a lot of friends this way.Use sites for dating, like match.com and eharmony. Although these sites are meant for helping people find romance, it is possible to make friends with the men and women who you don’t end up dating.
Use sites for platonic friendships, like Patook and Bumble BFF. Those are structured like dating apps but only have members who are looking for friends.
Use sites made for kids to teach them how to make healthy friendships online. Sites like Stardoll and Gaia Online allow kids to create friendships over safe things like comic books and tv shows.

, Start a blog and promote it through social media. Once you start to generate readers and followers, you can comment on other blogs, which will warrant comments on your posts by other bloggers. This is a fun way to connect with like-minded writers and discuss issues that are relevant to your daily life, as well as provide you a space for venting your thoughts.

Blogging is also becoming a way for many people to make good money.
Sites like Blogger.com, Wordpress.com, and LiveJournal are reliable blogging spaces.

, Most large cities have MeetUp.com sites so that community members can easily find others who share their interests. Meetup sites tends to focus on meeting in real life, but since these are group-oriented activities, users who are accompanied by friends are generally safe., As seen in steps above, joining online gaming communities is an easy way to make friends. To play most games, however, you have to purchase the disc and pay for an online subscription, as well as have the home equipment to use it. Some free games do exist, but they are usually not as fun or interactive because gamers don’t like them.You usually need either a fast, high-capacity PC or a gaming system like PlayStation or Xbox, with a good quality controller and headset, to truly enjoy the gaming scene and make friends.

, Why not make friends while earning money? Many freelancing websites allow you to set up chats with clients and fellow freelancers so that you can more quickly communicate about the work. These chats can easily turn toward personal things, developing friendships while you do your work.

Such sites include UpWork.com, WriterAccess.com, and Freelance.com.

If so, take action to remove any social media posts or other pages online that hurt your reputation., You might be tempted to tweet using bad language or post pictures of you at a party, but remember that your social media can help take away from or help build your brand (as a personal brand or as a business). Don’t post blurry photos, posts with grammatical errors, or inappropriate content on your social media.

, Social media can be a great way to engage with strangers to network or to build your personal brand. However, if you want your personal social media accounts to be less serious and want to post media that might be deemed inappropriate, consider putting your social media on private.Be aware of who you give access to your social media accounts. They can easily screenshot your posts and share them.

, Go through your social media accounts and delete anything an employer would consider inappropriate or too public. If your social media is for a business, ask yourself if you have any posts that hurt the image of your brand. In the future, think before you post.


Ask yourself questions: “What reputation does this give me online?” or “Would I be comfortable reading this tweet outloud to my grandma or showing her this photo?” or “Does this improve or hurt my brand and the image I am trying to create for myself or my company?”

Typically, the “maximum” number of posts are: Twitter three times a day, Instagram one time a day, Facebook one or two times a day, and a blog two times per week., There are many tools available online, such as Buffer, to help you manage all your social media in one place. Put your social media on a dashboard to make managing your online presence easier. Using a single platform saves you time and energy when managing your online reputation., You can use online platforms to schedule social media posts. Scheduling posts allows you to stay active on social media, even if you are actually not paying attention to it. You can even think of a month's worth of posts in one sitting and schedule them to post throughout the month. You can also use scheduling to post at prime times of the day, so if you think of something you want to post in the middle of the night, you can set it to post the following morning."

Buy a domain name.,
Interact with your audience.,
Post valuable and original content.,
Use hashtags.,
Do a giveaway.",How to Manage Your Online Reputation3," Create a website for your personal or professional brand using a domain name. This way you will have control of what is attached to your name.Research competitor’s websites (such as other businesses in your field or other personal websites in your profession) for inspiration., Be active on social media by commenting on other people’s posts and responding to comments on your own posts. This will help you build connections and get your account well known. Replying to people personally and showing interest in what others have to say appeals to follower’s emotions and shows people that you are human outside of the screen., Make sure your photos are high quality images and that your posts are interesting, engaging, and worthy of being posted. Post your own content. Never steal content from others. Make sure most of your social media content is your own and not entirely reposts from other accounts.Post when people are awake and spread your posts throughout the day.

, Using hashtags can make your posts easily searchable and help you grow your audience. Use hashtags on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr to help more people find your accounts. Be careful to not use too many hashtags. Adding a dozen hashtags to the end of all your posts is going to look unprofessional, desperate, and annoy your followers.For example: “I had a great day today at the #Portland5K with the team. We really enjoyed a break from the rain. #runnerslife #adrenalinerush”

, To increase activity and followers, give something away on your social media. Make the giveaway to your followers only so people will follow you. This giveaway does not have to be huge. It can be as simple as a discount code, free trial, book, shirt, or following an account back.For example: “Giving away a signed copy of my book to one of my followers later this afternoon! Retweet to enter to win.”

Respond to negative reviews.,
Remain calm.,
Apologize for an account hack.",How to Manage Your Online Reputation4," Try not to take negative reviews personally. Always respond to negative reviews professionally and politely. Don’t make excuses for the mistake. Make sure you resolve any issues that you can and highlight your strengths in the process.


For example, you might say: “we are very sorry that the shirt shipped to you was the incorrect size. We make and produce thousands of shirts and sometimes mistakes slip through the cracks. We will happily ship you a shirt in the correct size for no charge.”, If something negative about you or your company is going around online, you need to stay calm. Don’t try argue with or insult people who are talking about you. In order to quickly recover from negative press, either from social media or a journalistic publication, you need to publically apologize and stay calm. If the problem is something you can and should fix, then fix it. Do better in the future and people will forget about the negative press., If your account gets hacked and something that does not follow your beliefs or values is posted, you need to take action. First, you should delete the post, especially if it an obvious hack or it is graphic and inappropriate. Next, you should post a public apology for the offensive post.For example, “We are very sorry for the offensive post that was published on our account earlier today. Our account was hacked, but we are taking measures to improve security.”

Keep personal information about yourself totally private.,
Keep information about other people private.,
Check your post before you submit it.,
Check the photos that you include as part of your blog.,
Protect your blog at all costs.",How to Keep Your Blog Safe," Many blog sites allow you to set your blog private so that only people you invite can read your blog.;
, Leave detailed information about your name, contact info, school data, and your close relationships out of your blog. Replace them using bogus ones instead. This info is what hackers and stalkers look for most of the time.

, Giving info about them can put that certain person in danger. If you are tempted to put suspicions about others don't even try to post it. Rumors are gossip; if you gossip verbally and it causes injury to another and that is called slander and if it's posted, it's libelous. You may even get sued if the person you insulted is too angry.

, Read it as if you were anonymous and check it in it's entirety for revealing personal information. Then, ask yourself how you would feel if your blog were read by teachers, parents, or any other citizen. Would you still submit it anyway? Also think about if it showed up in the daily newspaper or other blogs? Remember, blogs are public. If you don't feel comfortable having the world know your content, rewrite it.

, Are you compromising yourself or others? Would you feel comfortable having your future employer see them (if they do you couldn't find a perfect job). It's a sure possibility that they would. The photos and information you post can be accessed by anybody around the world.

, Keep your passwords to yourself and exit out of your blog page when your computer system is unattended to be absolutely sure that nobody can enter and write something pretending to be you.

Request the publisher crop the photo.,
Seek a children’s rights lawyer.",How to Keep Others from Posting Your Child's Photos Online," One of the easiest ways for others to post pictures of your child is for them to use an image you have already shared with them in some form. Limit what you post to social media, and only send pictures via text or email to people you trust to keep them private.Instead of sharing pictures via text, email, or on social media, share them in person when you meet up with friends and family. Show them the pictures on your phone or printed out, but do not give them a copy that they can save and post later.
If you want to share on of your child’s accomplishments on social media, opt for a text-only post rather than posting a picture.
Set any photos you do share to private on all of your social media accounts.;
, If you notice others taking pictures of your child or posting photos you shared online, have an open and honest discussion with them about your wishes for your child’s privacy. Let them know, “I would like to avoid having my child’s photo posted online.”Let the individual know what you would like them to do with the photo. You can ask them to simply keep it private, or request that they delete the picture completely.
If the individual is hesitant about your terms, calmly and clearly outline your reasoning for why you trying to protect your child’s privacy.

, If an individual still resists your terms after you've let them know that you don't want images of your child posted, tell them know that you will take immediate action on the sites to which they post to have the photo removed. Sometimes just the threat is enough to get others to act.


Let them know, ""I've clearly outlined my terms and my wishes surrounding my child's likeness. If you do not take this image down, I will put in a formal request to have the image removed and have your account blocked or suspended.""

, If you must share pictures of your child online, do not tag your photos on blogs, websites, or in social media. If you post them to a website or blog, do not add SEO tags, captions, or terms for that particular image.


Tagging your image, including adding hashtags, makes it easier for others to search and find pictures of your child that they can then repost or use as they see fit.
If you are posting the photos to a blog or personal website, you may also consider watermarking them to discourage others from using them., People and businesses cannot post your child’s likeness for any commercial purposes without the express, written permission of the child’s guardian. Contact your child’s school, daycare, and any place your child regularly visits to request no photos of your child be reproduced by the institution.In some cases, these places might already have a form drawn up that you can sign to suspend their right to use your child’s likeness. In other cases, you may have to draw up a letter on your own. Call the institution to ask about their specific policy.
Some places will sneak these policies into broader waivers or even student handbooks. Read them carefully before you sign anything.

, Rather than discouraging your child from having social media accounts, which can simply push them to create secret accounts behind your back, allow them access to social media that you can monitor. Check accounts on sites like Facebook and Instagram daily to see what others have posted using your child’s image.Go through your child’s friends or followers and unfollow or unfriend anyone your child does not know in person. Let your child know that you will be checking on who follows them, and explain your reasons for removing strangers from their account.
If you notice them getting tagged in other people’s photos, talk to them openly and honestly about the risks of having others post their photo online. Let them know that it is okay to ask for a photo to be deleted or to stay private.

, Photographers have a great deal of legal leeway when it comes to photographing in public spaces. Private spaces, however, can dictate if and when photos are allowed to be taken. Know the policies of the businesses and buildings you enter with your child, and establish rules for photography in your home.Kindly let others know that you do not give them permission to photograph your child your home. If you notice a visitor taking pictures, let them know, “We’d prefer guests do no photograph our family in our home.”
When you are visiting someone else’s house, ask them, “Are you restricting photographs in your home?” If they are not, express your preference that your child not be photographed.

, If you notice someone else has posted a photograph of your child without your permission, immediately contact the website and ask about protocol for removing the photo. Explain that you are the child’s legal guardian and you do not consent to that photograph.


Social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram all have policies set in place to report a photo that you feel violates your family or your child’s privacy.Facebook also has easily-submitted online forms for photos of individuals under the age of 18 that you feel violate the child’s privacy., If someone shared a group image such as class picture that has your child and others in it, contact the poster directly and request that they crop the photo so that your child does not appear. You may also request that they blur or black out your child’s face.Contact the individual and let them know, “I acknowledge that you have the right to post this photo but I request that my child’s likeness be removed from it.”

, If someone is repeatedly posting pictures of your child for commercial purposes or malicious purposes such as pretending your child is their own, immediately contact a children’s rights lawyer. They can help you navigate the law to have the images taken down and see if there is a civil or criminal case against the individual.If someone has claimed your child as their own, do not try to reach out to them or reason with them. Block their access to all of your personal media and immediately contact an attorney.

If the case is severe, press charges.",How to Deal With Cyber Bullying As a Child or Teen," Anything that shows proof of them cyber bullying. If it is an email, you can go on the computer and print it out, instead of simply saving it onto your phone. Cyber bullying is somewhat easier for a bully to perform, since they don't have to do anything when the victim is right there in front of them. But you're smarter than that. You may just want to click ""delete"" on every hateful email, text, or IM. However, this is not the right way to go. Because there may come a time, when this bully needs to be reported- and you'll need all the evidence right there in front of you. Save and print each and every mean thing they send. Bookmark or ""favorite"" the webpages they insult you on. The day will come when you'll need this untenable evidence to accuse them and stop them.;
, If you receive a ""bully"" message, never get more involved than you need to. Replying to that hurtful comment will only worsen the problem- what you say on the internet, STAYS there, no matter what you do; and anger, sadness, or any other emotion that can cause you to do this you'll regret. Keep yourself cool. Remember that It's okay to be upset, but responding to the bully just as they responded to you will fix nothing other than add more fuel to the fire.

, Emails, screen names and images of themselves can be deceiving, and can temporarily disguise a bully. However, there are ways of figuring out the guilty party. First, write down the email or screen name you've received this from. Check your inbox- have you ever received ANYTHING from this person before? This may clue you in. If not, simply go to the email provider (after the @ part of the email) website, and search the screen name you have. If the profile is not blocked, you should be able to view this person's name. When all else fails, get others involved. Let your parents, a teacher, or another adult you trust know about the situation. Most likely, they can track the IP address, and get the exact location of the attacker.

, A cyber bully is nothing when not behind their internet mask. Talking to them about it upfront might even scare them away. If this person seems to not be intimidated, or issues more violent or humiliating threats, contact an adult to intervene.

, Bullying of any kind is illegal in most states. After letting a parent into the situation, allow them to contact the bully's parents (if the school has not already done this). If you've suffered severely from this, or experienced humiliation or violent threats/acts, this girl/boy can be suspended, expelled, or even arrested, depending on how severe they have acted towards you.

Services like these often cost money, but it is worth the investment since you won't need to constantly check if you are using safe sites or not.


Even if you can't use any security services, it is usually free to check URLs on their websites using the link scanner tool like Norton's Safe Web. You can also scan links with services like Securi.;
, If you are using a search engine, such as Google, to get to the website, note how far it is from the top of the results page.


Generally speaking, more trustworthy websites will appear at the top of your results page. The farther down you go, the more you risk clicking on an unsafe site.
Keep in mind that people can pay to get their website closer to the top of the results list. Most hackers and scammers will not do this, but don't automatically trust the first result anyway.

, Hackers and scammers often change the text of links so that you think you're clicking on one website, when you're actually being led to an unsafe site. If you hover your mouse over the link before you click it, it will display the full URL in the bottom corner of your browser. (You can test this out by hovering over the links in the list of sources for this article.)


Even if you use an online security service, this is a good precautionary step for new, unfamiliar websites.

, It may sound stupid, but if you don't think a link is safe, you shouldn't click it. After all, nobody is forcing you. If the URL looks suspicious or it looks like a scam, it may be an unsafe site.

, Is there a place you can find the creator's contact information (name, email address, phone number, etc)? Most widely used, safe sites such as Facebook or WikiHow do. If you are on a scamming or phishing website, they most likely won't leave you a way to reach them in fear of getting caught.


All sites are different, and some scamming or phishing sites may have fake contact information as a way to trick you into trusting them. If you can safely do so, double check that the information is legit.

,


Are there any grammar or punctuation issues? Misspelled words? Sometimes when scammers or hackers are in a rush, they will forget to check these things. Commercial websites such retail stores or banks wouldn't have simple errors like this.
Is there a company logo anywhere? How about pictures? If the site doesn't look professional, it probably isn't. Even if the site is safe, you probably don't want to trust any info you find there. If they didn't take the time to make the site, they probably didn't take time to research either.
Does it request your personal information? Are there suspicious attachments or deals that are too good to be true? Hackers and scammers often want to trick you into handing over personal information, so think before you enter any ""contests"" that require a credit card number.

,


Are there real links mixed with fake links? Sometimes this can signal a fraud, as people mimicking another website will often have real links to a privacy policy or a terms of service page amongst links to fraud websites. They do this to make it appear more ""real"".
Beware of popups! Phishing scams will sometimes direct you to a real website with popups leading to a fake or unsafe one.

Understand how to counteract this type of attack.",How to Deal with a Man in the Middle Attack1," Since a man-in-the-middle attack (MTM) can succeed only when the attacker can impersonate each endpoint to the satisfaction of the other, the two crucial points in defending against MTM are authentication and encryption. A number of cryptographic protocols include some form of endpoint authentication specifically to prevent MITM attacks. For example, SSL can authenticate one or both parties using a mutually trusted certification authority. However, SSL is still not supported by many websites yet. Fortunately, there are three effective ways to defend against a man-in-the-middle attack even without SSL. These methods are able to encrypt the data traffic between you and the server you are connecting to, and also include some kind of end-point authentication. Each method is broken down in the following sections."

Choose strong passwords.,
Be mindful when installing programs or agreeing to terms.,
Do not give out personal details to strangers.,
Don't fall prey to phishing scams.,

Always check for secure transaction info.,
Download files from trusted sources.,
Do not open e-mail attachments.",How to Be Safe on the Internet," Passwords are like the key to your accounts - only the person with the key can access them. When choosing a password, you want to make sure you choose one that is unique, strong, and not easily guessed by strangers or those close to you. Choose a password that uses letters, numbers, lowercase, uppercase, and characters.Choosing password or 1234 is lazy - and easily guessable. Choosing birthdays of those close to you (or yourself) is probably also not safe. The longer your password is, the harder it will be to guess. Also try leaving out letters, or substituting numbers for letters.
Try passwords that reference phrases or things significant only to you. For example, if the name of your beloved childhood goldfish was Sir Bubbles, swap out some of the letters for numbers and you can end up with a very nice password like s1rbubb735 that only you understand.
Make sure to choose passwords that are easily remembered or write them down. If you write down your passwords, don't leave them in plain sight. Don't keep them on your computer desk by your computer.
Never use the same password for different accounts. If you don’t want to come up with and keep track of dozens of different passwords, come up with a base password (ex. s1rbubb735) and tack a logical modifier onto it for each account. For example, on Amazon, use amzns1rbubb735; on Gmail, use gmails1rbubb735 or for Twitter twitts1rbubb735.

It is good practice to change your password every few months.

, When you sign up for newsletters, install programs, or agree to anything, read the fine print. If you do not want to receive junk mail or get put on a telemarketer list, look for a small box near the bottom of the page that asks if you want to receive information and offers from other companies. The best sites will have a statement listed that they will not sell your name to other companies (though they may still send you e-mails themselves).


Quite frequently, some adware powered downloads, installation packages, malvertising even drive-by virus has the power to provide inexperienced users loads of junkware. Example is, Oracle's Java online installer bundled the installation of Ask Toolbar (aka, Search App by Ask) in its express install mode. For case study, you can review the following image for further references. To stop such an action that aims to promote foistware, one should take highly proactive approaches to keep all other bloatware at bay, e.g., scanning the downloaded executable file via an up-to-date virus protection or an online malware scanner (such as, Google's VirusTotal.com), always performing the ""clean"" or custom install mode, unchecking all other optional ""offers"" during the install procedure.
Many of these websites can put adware on your computer that tracks your movements and browser habits. Use caution when you come upon those kinds of websites.Some sites require you to give all your information to get the product. Only fill in required fields that are marked with an asterisk (*). If the info box does not have an asterisk, it is optional and you can leave it blank.

, Don't give your full name, address, or phone number to anyone online that you don't trust or know. This is especially important in chat rooms, when negotiating jobs or deals, or making plans through meet-up sites.


Be careful when making friends on the internet. Many great friendships can be cultivated through social media, but there are many people who pretend to be someone they are not.
Practice caution when dating online. Use only your first name, and never give out specific personal details, no matter how great the other person seems. Don't give money to people you have met online. When you finally decide to meet, always meet in busy public places, like a restaurant or coffee shop. Let other people know where you are going, and never let them pick you up or go back to their place.Giving personal details to strangers not only compromises your accounts and identity, but your physical safety as well. While most people on the internet may be benign and friendly, you have to be aware of the possibility of people using chat rooms, social media, and other websites to collect information that could lead to physical harm at your place of employment or at home.
Always check the legitimacy of websites when you shop. If the site has a messy design or pop ups, it might not be legitimate. Beware of sites that don't allow you to pay through things like PayPal or with a credit card.When shopping on sites like Craigslist, practice caution.

, Phishing e-mails are messages that appear to be from legitimate companies, such as your bank or stores where you've shopped, that provide links to fake websites and ask for personal information.Always look at the e-mail address. Many senders of online scam e-mails won't have addresses that match the company they claim to represent. Or the address will be altered slightly so that it might not catch the eye of an unmindful person.
Beware of phishing e-mail scams claiming to be from eBay, PayPal, a bank, or a company you trust asking for personal or sensitive information. The e-mail may inform you that there is a problem with your account and/or password. There may be a link to click inside. If you get an e-mail like this, don't click on the link. Go directly to the website by typing the URL into your browser.
Hover your mouse over suspicious links. At the bottom of your screen, you should see the true URL for the website. Many phishing websites will show a different website in the bottom of your browser or beside your mouse when you hover over the link.Forward any of suspicious e-mails to the company it claims to be sent from. They will confirm whether the e-mail you received was real or not.
E-mail programs like Yahoo!, MSN, Hotmail and Gmail will never ask you for your e-mail password. Don't fall for it and give away your password.

, Online scams crop up everywhere. These scams can pop up in e-mails, tweets, Facebook posts, and many other places. Don't click on links that don't look like a real address or contains a lot of letters and characters that look like gibberish.


Never click on pop-ups or e-mails that claim you have won millions of dollars. These are scams.
Don't fall prey to e-mails inviting you to play foreign lotteries.Also beware of e-mails which ask you to help someone transfer large sums of money or inheritances out of their country after giving you a long sad story., Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other social media sites are part of most people's every day lives. On Facebook, people post their maiden names, their parents' names, their birthdays, the birthdays of their children, their hometowns, their home address, their home and cell phone numbers, along with myriad other personal information. This information gives anyone with a computer just about every essential piece of information about you.Limit what you share online to protect your identity and privacy.Sharing too many details on social media sites can put you in physical danger as well. Letting the internet know where you live and when you will not be at home may lead to someone breaking into your house - especially when they see all the photos of your new TV, computers, and jewelry. Too many personal details, like your home address, phone number, and daily whereabouts and habits, gives stalkers plenty of information to use against you.
Many secure sites, like banking, insurance, loan, and school websites, require security questions. These questions include: ""What is your mother's maiden name?"", ""What is your paternal grandmother/father's name?"", ""What town did you grow up in?"", or ""What is your father's birthday?"" These answers can be found easily on some people's Facebook pages.
Sharing this kind of information can result in identity theft.
When choosing security questions, don't choose ones that have answers easily discovered on social media. Choose harder questions only you know the answer to.

, It's best to have three accounts. Multiple e-mails help you separate different aspects of your life, gives you official and non-official addresses, and can help you cut down on spam and privacy issues.


Have a business e-mail to use for any job-related correspondence. Many times, these are given to your through your place of employment.
Have a main personal e-mail address. You can use this one for banking, job hunting, insurance, and other official and personal correspondence. This website can also be given to close friends and family members.
Have a junk e-mail. This e-mail can be the one you use to sign up for things on the internet or at stores, restaurants, or other places you might not want to have your main personal address. You can also use this e-mail on social media sites. If spam comes to this e-mail, it won't affect your daily, main personal e-mail or your business e-mail.

, Surfing the internet without these things is unsafe and invites spam, hackers, and viruses onto your computer. Having these safeguards on your computers protects you from things you might not even realize are threats. Make sure to keep them updated to catch the latest threats.


Trojans, spyware, malware, and viruses can not only make you vulnerable to identity theft and invasions of privacy, but they also can significantly bog down your computer and slow your processor.Anti-virus programs and anti-spyware programs protect your devices from these computer diseases, keeping your system healthy. There are many different programs available to purchase, but there are also many available for free online.
A firewall is hardware or software that creates a barrier between your network and the outside cyber world, allowing only certain data to cross.You can use either the firewall that comes standard with your operating system or a third-party software program to your liking.

, Many homes have wireless networks that connect computers, mobile devices, tablets, and gaming systems. Having a wireless network is convenient, but also can leave your devices and information vulnerable.


Change the name of your router from the default. This name needs to be something unique to you that can't be easily guessed by others.
Choose a strong password for your router, something not easily guessed by others. Use the same guidelines to choose a password you would for any protected online site.
Choose WPA2 or WPA security options for your router. They are more secure than WEP.Disable guest log in if your router has it. If you want to let friends use your Wi-Fi, but don't want to give them your password, set up a unique, strong guest password., These both put your files and system at risk for being opened by anyone on the wireless network, not just hackers. If you are within range of public wireless networks but don’t need to be online, turn off your wireless capabilities altogether.


In Windows, these options can be found under Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center.
In Mac OS X, they are under System Preferences > Sharing.
On some devices, there is simply an on/off switch for wireless; on others, you will need to configure this yourself (ex. on a Mac, click the Wi-Fi icon and turn off AirPort).
Join or use a public hotspot with caution. Because some could leak your sensitive info due to weak network passcode, or unencrypted connection. Moreover, one should consider using a valid, professional VPN service provider.

, The best companies will have many security devices in place. You may see a gold lock at the bottom of the page to indicate a secure site. When giving any bank details or other information, make sure the connection is secure.


Secure URLs begin with https:// instead of http://. This means the transmission is encrypted to and from the web server.Even if the connection is secure, still be mindful of what sites you are using. Not every site which runs HTTPS or accepts payments is trustworthy, even if the connection is. If you don't know anything about the site, do research first.

, When downloading files or software, only download from sites that have been rated or verified by trusted sources. Choose downloading resources that are upfront about price and ratings and vet their downloads (ex. download.cnet.com).


Beware of extra downloads. Sometimes when you download free software, like a game, an app, or even a browser, the download link contains browser toolbars and other unwanted add ons. When downloading a free program, always choose ""custom installation."" This allows you to unclick additional programs to install, like toolbars and add ons. Uncheck or deselect anything unfamiliar the site wants to download onto your computer.When in doubt, google the name of the site or download along with the word “scam” to see if you get any hits.
Do not download illegal copyrighted material without paying for it.

, Unless you know that a friend is sending you a .doc, .pdf, or other file to view, don't open the attachment. Some junk e-mails may contain viruses or spyware that can harm your computer. These e-mails may be automatically marked as ""spam"" or ""junk,"" but virus-ridden emails from unwitting friends can also slip through.


Avoid e-mails with file attachments ending in "".exe"" extensions.
If you use an email program like Outlook or Thunderbird, you can disable attachment previews. These take away your ability to decide whether or not to open an attachment. Look through your email program’s settings and disable options such as Show Attachment Previews, Display Attachments Inline, etc.

Be aware that it is important to be safe but it is also important to be realistic.,
Watch the disposition of people you don't know online.,
Understand that if a person on the chat starts the conversation by asking your age, where you live, your contact number and if your parents work, such questions are a red flag.,
Allow your inner self to hear what they are saying.,
Be especially alert when any stranger tries to be your friend when it's a ""friends only"" space.,
Listen to your inner sense of something not being right.,
Do not give out personal information online.,
Avoid using photographs.,
Immediately cease to talk to a person who makes offers of a meeting, a prize or anything similar.,
Keep it public.,
Use the power of the block.,
Keep a record.,
If you get a message telling you not to tell your parents about your chat or relationship, don't reply.,
Report any sexual and profane language such as ""You wanna do?"".,
Report cyber-violence.,
If someone hurts you or makes you feel uncomfortable, online or offline, always tell someone rather than repressing.,
Know you are not alone.",How to Be Safe in the Chat Rooms," While the following parts of this article discuss what to be careful of, and are things that both children and adults should be aware of, predators are a lot rarer than much of the scare tactics in online stories and safety software marketers suggest.Many of the people seeking to befriend others in a chat room really are seeking genuine friendship and are often just other children wanting to connect with other children.Approach chat room usage as follows:


Put the danger into perspective by being an aware user of chat rooms, not a terrified or suspicious chatter.
Know the signs of unsafe interaction so that you can shield yourself and focus instead on enjoying your chat room time.
Keep it in the open. Knowing what to look out for can also help you to alert others and to make it publicly evident whenever someone in a chat room appears to be at odds with the safe environment every other user of the chat room wants.

, When a new person approaches you or starts a conversation, be alert to any attempt at probing. If this person starts asking personal or private questions about you, such as where you live or if you are home alone, then he or she is not trying to be friends but is more likely to be a predator. This person may be trying to find out personal information so that he or she can harm you in some way.


Stay away from people who behave like this.
Do not reply.
If the person insists, log off from the chat rooms and even shut off your computer; tell your parents, an older sibling or some other trusted person.;
, Understand that any person who is unknown to you but pressures you for such personal information is more likely to be a predator, not someone genuinely seeking friendship.


Avoid replying, or do not give out the true information.
Make a clear statement, such as: ""Hey, I don't know you. Why do you want to know such personal information? That's creepy man.""

, Suppose someone starts talking to you, and tells you about school. You can chat back and forth without getting personal. They make you laugh and you kid around with them. You talk about teachers, homework, and movies. This is the start of a healthy friendship. Continue with this type of person, but again, be aware for warning signs. This is called a 'red flag' on the Internet. Once you sense a red flag, tell them you are uncomfortable and request to change the topic of conversation. If you continue to find red flags, discontinue the conversation.

, This is a major sign of inappropriate interaction; friends should only be people you know well.

, Feeling that you are mature and competent enough to handle strangers is all well and good. However, sometimes this is a denial of your ""icky"" feelings, so be alert when your inner gut senses something is wrong and pay attention to it.

, The following things should never be shared with strangers online (or via publicly readable/accessible areas of the internet):Your age and real name
Your home address
Your school address or name of your school
Your actual location or when and where you plan to hang out
Your workplace address (if you are a teen; adults can decide for themselves)
Phone numbers
Photographs of yourself, your family, your friends or your pets. Profile photos should be agreed upon with your parents if you are under 16.

, Even if your photograph doesn't show street names, license plates, or any PI, photographs that show what you (or your friends) look like and who you are can give away enough information to encourage unwanted attention.

, Anything like this is a potential lure to get you to give personal details or even to meet the person offline. Things to be instantly wary of include:An offer to meet famous people, such as pop stars or actors
A modeling assignment
Cut price tickets to a sporting or other event
Gifts of any sort, from electronics to makeup
Offers of hacks, cheats, passwords, etc.
Any request to appear naked or performing a sexual act; asking sexually charged questions; posting or sending sexually charged/naked photos
Offering quick money or money making schemes
Bullying
Intimidating, such as saying that the person knows where you live, what your family does, where you go to school, etc.
Asking to meet with you offline.

, Always stay in the public chat rooms with people you don't know. If someone you don’t know suggests going into a private chat room so you can talk in private, don’t agree. The public chat rooms have people in them, who will witness (and record) everything shared there. They might notice if there is something wrong. If you are in a private chat room alone with someone, there is no one to help you out.


Just because it's public, it doesn't mean you're totally safe. Even if you are in the public chat room and someone says anything which makes you feel uncomfortable, don't respond back. It is best to let this person know you are not going to engage at all.
Don’t get together with someone you meet in a chat room. If you really must, meet in a public place and bring along some friends. Most importantly, tell your parents what you're doing.
If you do plan to get together and meet, offer to meet in a police station. If they are who they say they are, they should agree to meet there because they have no reason to say no.

, If someone says or does something creepy — block them. Don’t respond. Read the next section about reporting bad behavior in a chat room.

, If you feel someone is a predator copy what they say into a word document so you can report it to the police and a moderator (if relevant). The more evidence you can provide, the greater the likelihood that something will be done to put a stop to the bad behavior.

, Tell an adult straight away. This is a ruse to keep you quiet, thereby allowing the bad behavior to continue.

, Leave and tell someone, such as the police and your parents, immediately.


If the topic turns to sex, always sign out. That can often lead somewhere you don’t want to go.

, Cyber-violence (unless make-believe, such as shooting orbs of water out of your hands) is not acceptable either. If anyone says ""*punches u and u bleed*"" or anything like that, leave and tell a trusted adult (or adults), such as the police.


Cyber-violence includes pretending that the person knows everything about you and threatening to harm or kill you, your family, your friends or your pets.

, Telling is not tattling.


If someone says, ""Don't be a snitch"" when you say you will tell, be reassured one hundred percent that telling is not snitching. Ignore this ruse to try to stop you from exposing their bad behavior and tell an adult or a moderator right away.
You may be afraid that your parents will restrict your time online. This is not a good reason to avoid telling your parents what happened. They are in a position to make things safer for you, such as telling the police, monitoring the site, changing the tools you use, etc. Yes, there is a chance they may change your online habits but this is for your safety and longer-term well-being, so put yourself first and get support.

, Many kids get harassed on the Internet, but now you know what to do if you are added to that already large group of kids. You are not the sole person who are embattled in this situation, so don't feel intimidated to report of predators in the chat rooms.

Log On to Myspace as usual.,
Go to your profile.

,
Make sure you don't have these things listed:


Your last name.,
Delete anything with the said above factors.

,
Delete any friends on your friends list who either a: you don't know, but they seemed nice, or b: they claim to live in your area, but they don't have any pictures and aren't friends with anyone you know.,
Make your Myspace private except for people listed on your friends list, and never add anyone you do not know in real life.",How to Be Safe on MySpace As a Teen,";
,, Just sign up with a fake one like 'blah blah' or use the last name of a favorite celebrity or fictional character. Use your middle name or mom's maiden name instead or keep it blank. (actually this isn't true, in order for people to search and find you on Myspace your last name has to be what it really is. But don't worry, this information is private and the only way it is used or seen is when friends search for you.) If your last name is very common, like Anderson, you don't have to worry about that. A list of common surnames can be found here.
Your full school name. If you go to a school called 'Riverside Clementine Junior High' don't put that on. Just put ""None of your Business"" or use the name of a fictional school, like Hogwarts or Pokémon Trainer School. Don't add your schools to your profile if you are under 18.
Your address, street name, city, phone/cell number, etc. These things are almost an instant key for pedophiles to find you. Just put something dumb, like ""123 Sesame Street."" Myspace does not give out addresses or phones by default, but watch these surveys.
Your full birth date. If you also post your location, someone can use it to guess your social security number (identification) and steal your identity. If you must, only put the month and day or just your age (without the birth date).
Where you go after school, on weekends, etc. If you go to practice at the soccer field outside of your school, just put ""Soccer Practice"". If you are going to a basketball game, just say ""basketball game"" on your status instead of your home team name, unless it is something common like Wildcats or Tigers.
What you 'like' in someone. Don't put 'I love rocker dudes who have pink hair and wear eyeliner and drink coffee.' Pedophiles usually come as the 'perfect match', which makes you trust them so quickly. Put more celebrity names or just say ""my friends from school or work or nice people""
Any pictures with license plates, addresses, store names (not Starbucks or Walmart or McDonalds, just local shops people can easily search up and find the one address), school names, or anything that leads a pedophile to you. Only post the name of a store or shop if you know it is a chain all over the United States or the world or blur the names out.

,, There is a good chance they aren't really friends.

, And there is a part on it where you can make your Myspace private from people you don't have as a friend. Only add celebrities and well known trusted people that you are not your friends. Do not add porn stars because you'll be filled with spam.

Read the label first.,
Record in a notebook what sheep you are vaccinating, the date and the vaccine batch.,
Get a syringe and needle.,
Disinfect the needle.,
Inject the needle.,
Safely dispose the needles.

,
Make sure you store the vaccinations properly when you have finished injecting the sheep.",How to Vaccinate a Sheep," It is vital that you read the label of the vaccine every time that you are about to vaccinate sheep. Even if you already know the label by heart, you still have to read it; otherwise you are making a criminal offense.;
, This important because if you forget and revaccinate the sheep it may get poisoned.

, Fill up the syringe to the desired amount. The most common is an 18 gauge needle that is 5/8 inch (2 cm) in length.

, It is best to use disposable needles, but that is costly.

, Either side of the neck is most common. For small lambs normally you pinch the skin and inject the liquid parallel to the skin and for full grown sheep you can jab it into the meat. When the needle goes in you should hear a pop noise.

,, Putting them in the bottom of your fridge is a suitable place.

Get the lamb some colostrum.,
Teach the lamb to drink from a bottle.,
Feed the lamb milk replacement.,
Increase the amount of milk replacement the lamb drinks gradually.,
Introduce hay, grass, and water.,
Give the lamb shelter.,
Supply warmth for the lamb.,
Give the lamb time outdoors.,
Socialize the lamb.,
Get the lamb vaccinated.,
Dock the lamb.,
Get the lamb drenched.",How to Raise an Orphaned Lamb," As soon as a lamb is born, it should drink a large amount of colostrum, which is the first milk that comes from mother sheep after birth. It is unlike normal milk because it is full of protein, fats, and antibodies that help a lamb thrive. Getting your lamb to drink colostrum should be a priority immediately after birth.Colostrum from other sheep or cows can be given to lambs. If you can get fresh or frozen colostrum that is ideal. Supplements are typically available at farm supply stores or websites but are considered less effective.Your lamb should have about 500mL of colostrum over the first day of its life. This should be fed over the course of 6 to 8 feedings.;
, Have the lamb stand up with its head up. Slowly put the nipple of the bottle in the lamb's mouth and move the lamb's jaw up and down in order to press the nipple together so that milk comes out. After about three or four times of opening and closing the animal's jaw, the lamb should catch on and suck regularly.If your lamb does not catch on, you should consult with a veterinarian. They may suggest the use of of feeding tube if your lamb is in desperate need of nutrition.

, Once the lamb has drunk colostrum for the first day of its life, you can switch to milk replacement. The lamb will need to begin by drinking 140mL of milk replacement every four hours.Milk replacement can be obtained from your local feed store or ordered from a livestock supply website. Be sure to follow instructions on the replacement container, as some brand's mixing instructions differ from others.

, Over the course of the first couple weeks, gradually increase the amount it eats to 500mL every four hours. Feed that much to the lamb for two weeks and then increase the amount you feed it again, to 700mL three times a day for two weeks.After that, you can begin reducing the amount of milk replacement you are giving the lamb, down to 500mL twice daily.

, When the lamb is several weeks old you can begin giving it access to grass, hay, and water. As the lamb begins to eat these things, you will be able to wean it off of milk replacement.Once the lamb is over a month old, you should be reducing its milk intake. My the time it is three months old it should be totally weaned.

, A motherless lamb is less likely to survive in part because it could get hypothermia from the elements. It will not have a mother to get shelter from at night, so you will need to supply some.Give the lamb access to a pen at all times but make sure that it is in there at night.
It is very important to give the lamb shelter from wind, which can really cause a lamb's body temperature to plummet.

, In addition to a basic shelter, you will need to make sure the lamb is given additional heat. Put dry bedding, such as straw, to the pen to insulate the lamb from the cold. Also add hot water bottles, heat lamps, or portable heaters to replicate the heat that would normally be provided by a mother.If you put heat lamps or heaters in your lamb's shelter, make sure that the animal has no way of coming into contact with it. These can pose a physical danger to the lamb and a fire hazard if not used safely.

, Even if the temperature is cold, your lamb needs some time outside. Let it get sunlight, fresh air, and space to roam every day. This is important for its development and its enjoyment of life.

Ideally, if it is cold outside, this time would be in the warmest part of the day.

, If at all possible, you should make sure your lamb bonds with other lambs and sheep. Put it out in a pasture with other sheep and let it explore new relationships with other sheep.

This will help it to learn how to function as a sheep, as opposed to as just a pet in your home forever.

, You will need to get your lamb vaccinated early in its life, at about 3 months of age. Vaccinations for tetanus and pulpy kidney are typically recommended by veterinarians but there may be others that they suggest as well.Choose a vaccination that has added B12 in it. This will help your lamb's health, as well as protecting it from illness.
Vaccinations are particularly important for lambs that did not get enough, or any, colostrum. If the antibodies and immune system defenses in colostrum are not given to a lamb, you will need to supply them through a vaccination.
You can either do the vaccination yourself or have a veterinarian do it. Vaccines for lambs are typically available through your veterinary clinic and they can show you how to do it as well.

, Docking the lamb is a process in which the tail is removed. It is typically done when the lamb is between a week and three weeks old. The modern way of docking a lamb is done by placing special rubber bands around the tail and testicles.If your lamb has testicles, these can be removed at the same time, in much the same manner.
During docking ask a veterinarian or rancher for help with this process.

, You will also want to have your lamb ""drenched"" when they are about a month old. This is a process of giving the lamb medication to protect it from worms. This is done with a special tool, called a drenching gun, that is used to give the lamb the medication orally.

Discuss the best drenching medications for your lamb with a livestock veterinarian.
Dosing will vary depending on the specific drenching medication you use. Look at the packaging and calculate the dose for your lamb's specific age and weight.

If you walk toward the ram you may be able to disorient it long enough to make an escape.Your main objective is to get to a gate and get out of the situation, so if walking toward the ram means walking away from a gate, you may need to take a different approach.
Don’t run toward the ram as it may see this as a charge. Simply walk at an even pace toward the animal.
If the ram backs up and you keeping walking toward it for long enough, it will most likely charge at some point, so be ready to perform another defensive technique.;
, You’ll probably need to carry the stick into the pen with you ahead of time. A stick that is three or four feet long and a couple inches thick is ideal. As the ram charges hold the stick out in front of you and swing it in a downward motion.


This may stop the ram in its tracks, but you should also be prepared to dodge in case it does not stop completely.

, It may be scary to stand still while the ram charges you, but running away is not an option since they can run up to 40 mph. When the ram gets close to you, it will get onto its hind legs, meaning it can’t move side to side. This is the moment when you dodge to the side.Since the ram is expecting to butt its head against something after it lunges, it will be confused when it only hits air. Use this time to make your next move.

, If you are able, grab the ram’s horn as it gets near to you and let its momentum swing the ram in a circle. If you can grab its back leg you may be able to bring it to the ground. This is a risky maneuver and should only be done in dire circumstances.Grab either the right horn with your right hand or the left horn with your left hand and swing the ram around the same side of your body as the hand you grabbed with.
As the ram swings in a circle, you may be able to grab a hold of the other horn and twist the ram’s head in a way that will bring it to the ground.

"
"
Keep your eyes on the ram at all times.,
Avoid scratching or pushing a ram’s head.,
Keep your head upright around a ram.",How to Defend Against a Ram2," If a ram decides to charge, it can get to you pretty quickly, so it is highly advised to never turn your back on a nearby ram. Knowing where the ram is at all times is the most effective safety measure.This takes vigilance, but it is the kind of proactive measure that is most likely to pay off. If you can see the ram always, then you have a better chance at defending yourself in case of a charge.
To the end of always having eyes on the ram, it is advisable to work with at least one other person, which can help you get done what you need to while still keeping the ram in sight.

, The ram’s head is its main weapon, so touching its head can be taken by the ram as a sign of aggression. This is why it’s especially important never to pet a ram on the head. Even if it seems friendly, this act can change the ram’s demeanor quickly.Rams that were raised as pets may get close and nuzzle in a way that encourages you to pet them, but you have to avoid it no matter what.
Pushing a ram’s head, even more than scratching or petting, will be taken as an act of aggression against it and can lead a ram to become aggressive.

, When a ram is about to charge, it lowers its head. So if a ram sees you lower your head toward it, this will be taken as a sign that you are an opponent. If you lower your head, you are challenging the ram and you may cause it to charge you.This is especially important to keep in mind if you happen to drop something and need to bend over to pick it up. You should squat and keep your head upright as much as possible so the ram doesn’t see you lower your head.

Be fully aware why lameness in sheep is a real problem.,
Understand what it's costing you.,
Cull.,
Quarantine.,
Treat appropriately.,
Avoid.,
Vaccinate.",How to Prevent Sheep Lameness," Lameness, to any degree, is causing sheep pain. It is a welfare issue and as an industry that prides itself on high levels of welfare, such pain is not acceptable. The image of sheep grazing happily in fields is something that needs to be preserved. It isn't something to be tainted by lame sheep, particularly as welfare creeps up on the public and government agendas.


Lame sheep cannot eat properly, or at all. This affects its health, immunity and production value.;
, Lameness expert Laura Green, of Warwick University, estimates that it could be costing as much as £10-15 for every ewe put to the tup with 8% lameness in the flock, that's up to £15,000 for a 1,000-ewe flock.

, Focus on recording which sheep are lame. Persistently cull lame sheep humanely. Green suggests this should occur only after the third treatment is unsuccessful.

, When buying in stock, always quarantine the sheep before introducing them to your existing flock. , Distinguish between foot-rot and CODD (contagious ovine digital dermatitis). If you're not sure, talk to your vet and learn all that you can.


Isolate sheep undergoing treatment.
Apply appropriate treatment options as recommended by the vet. A long-lasting antibiotic injection may be the first option.
Do not trim the sheep's feet during recovery.
Do not breed from treated sheep.

, Use hydrated builder's lime on all handling areas.


Handling areas should have hard ground, without stones. This will stop harm occurring to the sheep's feet.
Consider using portable handling areas. These have the advantage of being moved around and prevent the congregation of lots of sheep in any one spot, reducing the possibilities for contagiousness.

, Adopt a foot-rot vaccination program

Check sheep hooves regularly.,
Know how to spot problems.,
Treat hoof infections.",How to Deal With Hoof Problems in Sheep," During the wetter seasons, check daily.;
, Some of the more common problems that you might see include:


Foot scald: white-pink skin between the clefts of the hoof, possible lameness
Foot rot: infection in the hoof wall, lameness.

, The following treatment might help but see your vet if you have any concerns and if things do not improve.


Make up a solution of zinc sulphate and water (10 percent solution).
Soak the infected hoof for a few minutes.
Keep the sheep on a dry surface after to allow the solution to dry completely.
Check daily for improvement or otherwise. See the vet if it does not improve after a few days.

Decide the reason why you want to keep sheep.,
Consider if you have the financial resources and time resources to raise sheep.,
Choose a breed within these categories:



Wool breeds - Merino, Rambouillet, etc.,
Decide how many sheep you will purchase.,
Create a suitable environment for the sheep.,
Some organic sheep breeders believe it is possible to run as many as 18 sheep per hectare.,
Order your chosen breed from a certified breeder.,
Bring your sheep home.,
Feed them when required.,
Make sure there is always fresh water.,
Comb them and wash the sheep regularly.,
Keep the sheep wormed and healthy.",How to Get Started in Raising Sheep," Sheep are kept for a number of reasons - for reasons of earning a living from their wool, hides, meat and milk; for reasons of hobby farming to obtain organic homegrown meat and for their other products; for vegetation control; or to be a pet. Some people even like to raise sheep as a replacement for empty nest syndrome. It is important to understand from the outset that you cannot try to do everything with this multi-purpose animal because different breeds are more suited to one aspect or other and the pasture, feed and production practices will vary according to what you want the sheep for. Unless you have the necessary time, appropriate experience, adequate resources and appropriate pasture, don't over-extend!, Finances involved in setting up a sheep-breeding operation include the cost of the sheep, the cost of fencing, any feed required, vaccinations and vet checks and transportation costs. In addition, any requirement to stockpile food and provide a shelter for lambing and very poor weather needs to be taken into account.

,;

Meat breeds - North County Cheviot, Southdown, Dorset, Hampshire, Suffolk, and Texel etc.;

Dual purpose breeds (both wool and meat) - Columbia, Corriedale, Polypay, and Targhee etc.; and

Triple purpose breeds (milk, wool and meat) - mainly in Europe.

, Where you are and the productivity of your land will determine how many sheep you are able to sustain. Additionally, if you are seeking to make a profit from the sheep, you will need to factor in the market prices and the likely returns. In many places, it is very hard to make a profit from sheep raising on a small scale. It becomes even more difficult when the environment includes a harsh winter and additional feed and shelter must be provided for the sheep.

, Determine how much land you have available for your sheep. A rough rule of thumb is 5 ewes per acre.

, The pasture must also be productive. Provide adequate fencing around the area to prevent wandering and to prevent dog (tame and feral) or other animal attacks. Provide some form of simple shelter for the sheep - adult sheep are fairly hardy provided you have selected the right type for the weather in your region.

, Purchase sheep breeds from recognized breeders. There should be a local or national sheep breeder's association that can assist you to find the names of breeders. Check online or in phone directories.

, If you can have the sheep delivered, this is obviously easier. If you must collect them yourself, hire or purchase a suitable sheep trailer for safe transportation. If you need to make several trips, make sure the breeder is not too far away from you or you may need to make arrangements for overnight accommodation for you and the sheep.

, The key to feeding sheep is to ensure good quality pasture. Poorer pasture should be supplemented with hay, specialized pellet feed and salt lick blocks. When sheep are unable to graze, such as during winter when snow is on the ground or during a drought when pasture is poor or non-existent, you will be obliged to feed the sheep daily. This is a time-consuming process, so consider this possibility if you are not farming full-time.

, Ensure a steady supply of water, usually in the form of a long trough accessible by many sheep at once. Check regularly that the water is being recycled daily (if electrically driven by pump) or ensure to change the water by hand daily. If you don't they will get sick.

, If you are raising sheep for wool, showing, or as a pet, regular grooming ensures a healthy and tidy fleece.

, Ensure that the sheep are wormed regularly with a commercial worming paste suitable for sheep. Other considerations include dipping sheep to prevent pest infestation and in some places, tails are docked as a precaution against fly-blown disease. If you are in an area subject to foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks, take appropriate precautions to protect your sheep. Seek veterinarian advice on the best and most humane procedures for protecting your sheep against disease.

, There should be adequate bin space.

, If a fleece is not thrown properly, it may become broken or fall into pieces. Or, skirtings might become lost in the fleece wool.

, Spread the fleece flat and straight the edges. Trim.

,


A fleece that has no plant matter in it: Remove sweaty and fribby (side) pieces. Remove back wool if short, tender, mushy, or earthy. Removed britch wool from the sheep's hind quarters if it is too coarse or hairy.
If the fleece has burrs or seeds in it: Work around the selvedge edge and remove burry parts. Trim as above.
Medium level of burrs or seeds: Carefully trim to remove burrs and seeds; leave as much free wool or lightly burred fleece as possible.
Totally covered in burr/plant material: Remove a minimum amount of fleece (the sweaty, fribby, stained piece, and dags.)

, This is the beginning of classing them.

, Stack neatly per type of fleece (separate stacks).

, Five bales of one uniform type form one big lot.

, Sweep up burrs, fleece, dags, dirt, etc. Dispose of properly.

, Use the approved method in your region.


Use all identifying numbers and text as required.
Provide all relevant information to help the seller classify the lot easily.

Provide year-round shelter.,
Give them straw bedding.,
Make sure that your pasture supports the number of sheep you choose.,
Keep the airflow moving.,
Set up fencing.,

Avoid over-feeding your sheep grain.,
Avoid storing feed for more than one month.,
Make sure your sheep have access to salt.,
Provide them with fresh, clean water.,
Maintain their hooves properly.,
Shear them at least once a year.,
Perform preventative health care.,
Keep an eye on general health.,
De-worm your sheep.",How to Care for Sheep," Your sheep need a shelter that protects them from all the elements, year round. These elements include sun, wind, and rain. While a barn is a great, it's not necessary. A three-sided structure works just as well.The nice thing about having a barn with stalls is that you can separate sick or pregnant sheep from the rest of the flock.
A shaded area outside is a good idea, so that the sheep can be outside in the warm weather, but have somewhere cool to graze. This could be anything from an overhang off the barn, or a clump of trees.;
, How much bedding you have should depend on how much time the sheep spend in their shelter. For colder climates it's best to give them a good, thick bedding of hay. This will keep them clean and warm.Don’t use sawdust as this will ruin their wool and is also not very absorbent.
Some people consider pine shavings to be better than hay, because of its absorbency, but that simply depends on your personal preference. Pine shavings do cling to a sheep's coat, which can make it more difficult come shearing time.
You can sprinkle PDZ in each stall and under the overhang outside about once a month to neutralize urine.

, Sheep will spend about 7 hours a day grazing. An estimated 2 acres of pasture is needed for 6 sheep. The exact acreage needed will depend on the climate and the pasture's condition.A good rule of thumb is that a pasture that supports one large grazing animal (like a cow) should support about six or seven commercial sheep.
Pasture sizes vary based on locale, climate, maintenance, type of planting, and rainfall. For example: dry rocky conditions will need more pastureland to provide more grass.

, Install a fan, and keep the doors to the shelter open. This is especially important if you live in a hotter climate, or have hot summers. There should be airflow all throughout the year, even in the cooler times, although you don't necessarily want to have the fan going in winter.


A fan and open doors will cool the shelter on hot days, as well as keep the flies away from the sheep.

, Fencing is incredibly important for keeping the sheep in and the predators out. A five foot (1.5 m) tall fence should be enough to keep the sheep in the pasture. Higher fences are needed to keep predators out.


Make sure you have portable panels to enclose sick sheep, especially if you're also got stalls. You'll need to keep them away from the healthy sheep.
You can also electrify your fence. Even with a tall seven foot (2 m) tall fence, predators can dig under the fence and attack your sheep. Electrifying your fence will deter predators as soon as they touch the fence. Don't count on it keeping your sheep in, though. With heavy coats, sheep are less likely to feel the bolts of electricity.

, Sheep naturally eat pasture plants such as grass and clover. If the pasture is large enough and stays in bloom all year, you do not need to provide supplemental food for the sheep.The amount of pastureland needed will depend on your climate and how fertile the pasture is. In an average climate you can again follow the estimated standard of 2 acres of green pasture for 6 sheep. Climates with hot summers or cold winters that kill the grass will have less fertile pastures.
The amount of hay needed will depend on the quality and quantity of your grass. Sheep will eat around 1.5 lbs. (0.5 kg) of hay for every 100 lbs. (45kg) of their own weight.
Hay is basically cut, dried, and baled forage. It tends to be a grass or legume (like alfalfa or clover). The later the cutting the better the feed quality of the hay, typically.
Alfalfa and clover hays tend to be more nutritious and preferred by most animals. They are more expensive, though, and aren’t imperative for sheep.
Keep in mind that some clovers may contain a substance similar to estrogen which can work as birth-control in sheep, so avoid that if you’re trying to breed your ewes.

, Grain isn't actually that great for sheep, except in a few specific cases, because these mixes tend to contain too much copper for a sheep's diet. If you do need to supplement your sheep's diet with grain try to get a mix that is specially formulated for sheep.


Eating too much grain can also cause your sheep to bloat, and potentially die. So really avoid over-feeding grain.
A basic mix with corn/soy/oats, or specially formulated sheep/goat chow from your local feed mill should work if they need a little extra supplement. Ones that may need some grain added to their diet typically are young, lactating, or elderly sheep.
Goat or cow mixes are better than horse mixes if you can’t find one that is formulated specially for sheep. Again, sheep are sensitive to copper, so avoid all-purpose mixes.

, This is true for both baled hay and for grain mixtures. Storing feed too far in advance can cause it to mold and become toxic to sheep. So make sure that you're getting fresh food for them, if they need something beyond what's in the pasture. 

, Sheep need the minerals that come with salt. Make sure that you're getting minerals that are specially made for goats, because while they need copper too much copper can make them ill or kill them.


Salt blocks can be good, but they also don't last all that long and might not get enough minerals just from licking it.
Loose mineral salt tends to be less expensive than salt blocks and you can place it in a feeder in the shelter.

, Sheep need access to fresh, clean water. Sheep will consume a couple gallons of water each day, and more when it is hot and it needs to be clean (free of algae and so on).


You can use an automatic waterer if you don't want to have to carry a bunch of buckets every day. The tub automatically fills when the animals drink. All you have to do is scrub it clean once a week.

, You want to provide a dry surface for your sheep to walk on the majority of the time and helps to avoid things like foot rot. If it isn't possible for your sheep to spend time on dry surfaces you'll need to cut or pare away any excess horn (which is what their hooves are made out of).Make sure that when you do cut at the dead horn that you don't cut deep into sensitive tissue. This can cause bleeding and infection in the sheep.
In dry weather you want to trim their hooves every six weeks or so, more in wet weather. Start by digging out dirt from the toes. Trim away excess nail parallel to the lines of hoof growth. Pare the heels to the same level as the soles of the toes. Take away excess nail tissue around each toe. With a wood rasp, make the hoof flat from the sole of the foot forward.
Foot rot is a problem specific to sheep and goats. It's more frequent with animals who walk on damp or wet ground. Their hooves soften which makes it easier for bacteria to get in. Foot rot can cause severe pain and lameness and usually stays in the pasture around 12 days. Separate infected sheep from the flock (you'll notice a foul smell). Pare the hoof to remove excess horn, and apply antiseptic agents.

, Sheep with longer fleeces will need to be sheared twice a year. Consider shearing your sheep before the onset of warmer weather and avoid shearing before cold weather.


You want your sheep to be comfortable during the shearing, so keep your sheep off the pasture for at least ten hours before shearing. This will allow their stomachs to empty out.
Shearing wet sheep can cause health problems, so avoid doing that. Not shearing sheep and allowing their fleece to get waterlogged can make them more prone to flystrike.

, While you can't anticipate everything that might happen to a sheep (know your local veterinarian), there are some things you can do to care for your sheep. Performing these extra steps can help keep the sheep from certain sicknesses and problems.


Crutching means trimming the wool around the crutch of the sheep (the area immediately around and below the tail, down the hind legs and halfway to the underside of the body). Urine and feces can soil this area, so keeping it clean can prevent things like flystrike.






Dagging removes all the dirty wool around the rear end and belly of your sheep. Dags are basically the clumps of soft or hard fecal (or mud) material that's become bound into the wool of the sheep. Dags can attract blowflies, so try to remove the dags as soon as possible while they're still soft and the blowflies haven't found them yet. Use hand shears or digging shears.







, You'll know when your sheep is sick, basically they'll be doing things that are unusual or lethargic, and so on. Keeping an eye on their basic health can alert you to problems more quickly so that it doesn't spread to the rest of the flock.


A nasal discharge may be one of the first signs of a respiratory infection.
Diarrhea in sheep is about the consistency of dog stool. Diarrhea can be caused by all manner of issues, so it's a good thing to get a veterinarian in quickly.
Check the coat frequently for any external parasites such as mites or lice. They'll need to be treated immediately.

, You'll need to have your veterinarian occasionally check your sheep's stool to see if they have worms. If they do you'll need to rotate between ivermectin with fenbendazole or albendazole. No one product will destroy all types of parasites, unfortunately, so you should seek your veterinarian's help in determining what will be best for your sheep.Medication (dewormers) come in types: bolus (large pill), paste, liquid, pour on, and injectable. There is no one type that works most effectively.
Paste or liquid forms tend to be the easiest to use, but otherwise are no more effective than any other type.

Keep a record.",How to Drench Sheep," The correct drenching schedule can vary based on the conditions of your farm. It would be a good idea to talk to a livestock veterinarian concerning the best drenching program for you flock.If you don't plan on breeding your sheep, it's usually a good idea to do some preemptive drenching during shearing time. If you do intend to breed your sheep, however, preemptive drenching should be done four weeks before lambing.
Lambs should be drenched one or two weeks after weaning.
If you suspect that your sheep may have a worm disease problem during another period, you should collect samples and submit them to your livestock veterinarian for a worm test. Most vets will return the test within a few days at most.;
, Drenches are either broad spectrum or narrow spectrum. Choose the best type and brand based on the needs of your sheep.


As the names might suggest, broad spectrum drenches treat a wide range of internal parasites and narrow spectrum drenches only treat a limited number.
Broad spectrum drenches are good when your flock faces threats from a wide range of parasites.
Narrow spectrum drenches might be better when you only need to treat a certain type of parasite common during a specific time of year. They can also minimize the risk of drench resistance and may prove less stressful to the animal.
Note that there are also white (BZ), clear (AV), and yellow (LM) drenches. Each can perform the same basic function but may work differently, so you should check into which one best matches the needs of your flock before making a decision.

, Calibrate the drench gun to make sure that it will give an accurate dose.Remove the plunger from a 10 ml syringe and place your thumb over the end. Squirt a full 10 milliliters (0.34  fl oz) dose into the syringe from the drench gun to check for accuracy.
Repeat this step five to ten times before using the gun to deliver the drench.
Make sure that the drench gun is clean, free of leaks, and put together properly. Twisted tubes can result in harmful air bubbles. Additionally, you can check for leaks by placing your finger over the nozzle of the empty gun and squeezing the trigger.

, The dosage of your drench should be determined based on the weight of the largest sheep.


Do not base dosage on a smaller sheep. Using a smaller dose than necessary can cause the parasites to become resistant to the drench, making the medication less effective.
On the other hand, giving sheep a dramatically larger dosage than necessary could make the animal sick and may result in its death.
If the sheep in your flock vary greatly in size, split the group into different sections based on weight. Weigh the largest sheep in each group and calculate a different dosage for each group based on that.

, The correct dosage will vary based on the weight of your largest sheep and on the specific drench used.


Each drench is different, so you will need to read the package instructions that come with the drench to determine the proper dosage ration.

, Herd the sheep into an enclosed pen or yard. You'll need to organize them throughout the process so that you can determine which sheep have already been drenched and which still need the medication.


When you first gather the sheep, it's also a good idea to inspect the flock for animals that appear ill or injured.

, Load the drench gun with the correct dosage. Double-check that the dosage is correct before continuing.


Note that you should shake the container of drench to mix its contents before loading the drench gun.
Most drench guns have a dial on the side that allows you to set the dosage. Check this dial in between each drench to make sure that it remains set at the correct amount.

, Approach each sheep from behind and place your hand under its neck to hold it securely in place. Tilt the head slightly to the side to present yourself with a clear view of the mouth.


Even though tilting the head can help you administer the drench, keep in mind that the head should be mostly horizontal. Allowing the sheep's head to tilt too far to one side can cause some of the drench to slip out of the mouth, resulting in improper dosage. Pulling the head back too far can prevent the sheep from swallowing.
Do not put your thumb or fingers in the mouth, even if doing so would help you steady the sheep. The sheep will probably bite you if it senses your fingers near or inside its mouth.
Improperly restraining the sheep can result in serious injury. If it moves around too much, it may not swallow the full amount of drench. The nozzle of the gun can also penetrate the tissues at the back of the mouth, which may result in death.

, Slip the nozzle of the drench gun into the corner of the sheep's mouth.More specifically, the nozzle will need to fit into the gap in between the molar and incisor teeth.
Do not attempt to insert the nozzle over the front teeth since it isn't designed to fit there.
Once the nozzle is inside the mouth, position it so that it rests just above the back of the tongue. Pointing the nozzle in any other direction while drenching the sheep may result in improper administration.
Make sure that the nozzle doesn't point directly down the back of the throat. If it's too deep into the throat, it may prevent the sheep from swallowing. The correct position will be roughly at eye level of the sheep.

, Squeeze the trigger of the drench gun to deliver the medication into the mouth of the sheep.


The sheep may squirm as you squeeze the drench into its mouth, so prepare to tighten your grip to prevent the sheep from breaking free.
Be gentle yet firm while delivering the dose to each sheep. If you are too aggressive, you may damage the back of the throat, break teeth, or get the drench into the sheep's lungs.

, Remove the nozzle of the drench gun from the mouth and release the sheep once it swallows the dose.


As you remove the gun, you will still need to keep a steady grip on the sheep's mouth and head. After a few seconds, the sheep should swallow the drench, and it should be safe to release it.
If you release the sheep before it swallows the dose, the drench may spill out of the mouth or the sheep could spit some of it out.

, Repeat the drenching procedure with each member of the flock until each sheep has been medicated.


Carefully keep track of which sheep have been drenched and which ones haven't been.
Take your time. If you rush through any part of the process, you'll be more likely to make a mistake. Certain mistakes can be fatal to your sheep.

, After drenching your sheep, allow them to graze over a clean pasture to minimize the risk of possible re-contamination.


Allow the old pasture to rest for as long as possible before returning the sheep. Doing so will kill off more of the parasites previously festering in the pasture, making it safer for your sheep to graze over.

, After drenching your entire flock, clean and dry all of the equipment with warm water.


Rinse both the gun and pipe with warm water. Do not use any soap, though, since it can damage the seal in the gun and might be difficult to rinse out.

, Keep any unused drench in a cool storage area out of direct sunlight.


Ideal storage temperatures range between 39 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit (4 and 25 degrees Celsius).
Before using this drench again, make sure that it has not expired.

, When you administer white (BZ) and clear (AV) drenches, you should usually withhold food from your sheep for 12 to 24 hours to improve the effectiveness of the medication.


Most yellow drenches (LM) do not have a wait time, though.
Regardless of the drench you use, it's a good idea to to check the medication instructions for more accurate, specific information about withholding food.

, Record of the date and dosage each time you drench your sheep. Save this information in an official log book.


You should also make a note of the expected withdrawal period. This period will vary based on the dosage and the specific drench used, so check the instructions that come with the drench to determine what you should expect.

Start by planning.,
Gather supplies.,
Know your fish.,
Make sure the tank setups are working.,
Begin breeding and stocking your tanks.,
Keep healthy fish.,
Start up your shop.",How to Start an Aquarium Shop," Research is the key to success. Investigate how you will lay out your store, price your fish, what kind of fish you will sell and which breeders to contact. Or maybe you would like to breed your own fish. Breeding aquarium fish is one of the steps to becoming a skilled aquarist.;
, Listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section below.

, Learn as much as possible about the fish you want to sell.

Are the fish peaceful, semi-aggressive and aggressive?
Know which fish will be compatible with other fish, how large fish will get and how quickly, what the fish will eat whether they are herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores.
Know what the fish need their water temperature at for survival, best growth, and breeding.


Do your research on fish you order and make sure you have good knowledge on the fish you order and sell because the customers will have lots of questions. Be able to answer them quickly, easily and correctly. Your answers and suggestions to their questions about the fish may very well be the thing that brings them back or turns them away, and keeps their other fish alive or dead.

, Fish from a breeder might be ill. If you see signs of illness, remove the fish to a hospital tank. Check your fish daily and change the tank water often. Note: Commercialize your fish tanks as much as possible, but maintain happy fish. Healthy tanks attract customers.

, Before you add expensive tropical fish to your new tanks, you will need to go through the cycling process. This process is to avoid ""new tank syndrome."" You should cycle your tanks with a few hearty fish.


Add easy breeder fish such as guppies and mollies. Once these have a stable population in your tanks, start buying different types of fish. Stock up on food and medications.







, This can be a challenge. Once your tanks are set up and cycled through, you will need to care for the fish. Maintaining healthy fish will include these tasks:


Regular aquarium cleanings and water changes
Regular filter maintenance
Regular feedings, using a variety of healthy foods






Recognizing any odd behaviors in your fish






Inspecting your equipment






Many problems start with water quality. The quality of the water can be compromised when the decorations-rocks, gravel, plastic plants-are added. They may contain limestone which will make the water alkaline. You will forever struggle with maintaining the pH balance in your tank. Make sure the decorations you use are clean, appropriate and of a quality material.







, Once you have the amount of fish and tanks that you want, open your store up. Make sure to obtain the right permits before attempting this step. Read up on starting a small business."

These differences include how you initially set up the aquarium and all ongoing care, maintenance, everyday chores, and costs requirements. There are several key issues you will need to consider while you choose:


Saltwater aquariums cost more. Saltwater aquariums have specific water requirements that need extra tools and equipment to maintain it, as opposed to maintaining a freshwater aquarium. For example, most saltwater aquariums need protein skimmers or a foam fractionator in addition to the regular filter system that all aquariums need.Unlike a regular aquarium filter, protein skimmers completely remove dissolved organics from the water which is vitally important for saltwater aquariums where a build up of nitrates can be deadly.
Water changes are easier for freshwater tanks. All aquariums need weekly or bi-weekly partial water changes. For freshwater aquariums, simply doing a 10% to 20% water change with an aquarium vacuum and refilling the tank with dechlorinated tap or filtered water is enough. However, saltwater aquariums will require you to mix new saltwater days before your scheduled partial water change.
There are more saltwater invertebrates and fish to choose from. In terms of aesthetic and choice, there are more options available if you are choosing to have a saltwater aquarium. You can find stunning saltwater fish like angelfish, clownfish, and lionfish and a vast array of invertebrates available like starfish, shrimps, worms, and corals.
Saltwater fish may need special diets. In most cases, getting freshwater fish to eat flakes is not a problem. However, if you choose saltwater fish, especially those that need to be caught from the wild, they may need special diets or be weaned into eating conventional fish flakes and food. Giving fish an inadequate diet can lower their immune systems and cause diseases, which can eventually lead to death.;
, A small fish tank set up is generally more economical than a large fish tank. There are several issues you should consider when choosing the size of your tank:


Where will you put your aquarium? The best place to put a fish tank is away from direct sunlight and heater vents. Fluctuations in temperature and sunlight can cause green algae to form and dirty the water quality of your tank. In some cases, the best location for an aquarium can restrict the size of your tank.
Your aquarium stand should be able to withhold the weight of the tank. For each gallon (4 litres) of water, there is approximately 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of weight. Obviously, smaller tank would hold less weight than a larger one.
It’s harder to maintain the quality of water in a small fish tank. This means you will need to do more partial water changes than if you had a large fish tank.
The size of your tank will determine what type of fish you can have. Most fish require at least 5 gallons (20 litres) of water with the exception of betta fish that don’t need as much water. However, being able to survive in a certain condition doesn’t necessarily mean the fish is thriving or living a happy life.

, There are three main saltwater aquarium types: Fish Only, Fish Only with Live Rock (FOWLR), and the Reef Tank.Fish Only Tanks: As the name suggests, this tank only houses saltwater fish. It is the least expensive way to set up a saltwater aquarium. However, it does have its disadvantages. Fish Only tanks take longer to set up, require more frequent tank maintenance and testing, and have a shorter shelf life than the other types of saltwater aquariums.

Fish Only with Live Rock: FOWLR tanks are set up like Fish Only tanks but with the addition of live rock and better aquarium lighting. The live rock acts as a natural biological filter for saltwater and keeps your tank healthier than a Fish Only tank. A live rock has hundreds of tiny creatures and biological organisms living inside and on the surface of the rock.

Reef Tank: If you choose this type of saltwater aquarium, you are most likely looking towards having invertebrates, corals, or anemones as the main focus of your aquarium and fish are just an afterthought. Reef tanks require daily water quality checks, high lighting levels, extra water supplements, heavy duty filtration systems and are generally the most expensive to maintain. Reef Tanks are recommended for more experienced aquarium hobbyists.

, The kind of lighting and the temperature of your aquarium depend on what kind of aquarium you have and who your tank inhabitants are. The type of light you choose also affects the overall temperature of your tank.Aquariums that are Fish Only: This means your freshwater tank will not have real or live plants in it. In this case, you will most likely be using fluorescent lights that are between 18 and 40 watts.

Freshwater aquariums with plants: The type of lighting you’ll need will depend on the depth of your tank, the plant species you have, and the desired growth rate of the plant. Usually, you should provide 2 to 5 watts of light per gallon in a planted freshwater aquarium. Always research and consult with your aquarium expert when you plan to have plants in your tank.


Saltwater Reef Tanks: These tanks need high levels of light that are characteristic of high output fluorescent and metal halide lamps. Some corals may even need more intense levels of light that can be achieved with T5-HO, Very High Output (VHO), and metal halide lights.

, All filters have three functions to them, which include mechanically filtering the water by trapping or removing free floating particles, biologically filtering the water by growing good bacteria, and chemically filtering the water by dissolving wastes. There are various types of filter:



Mechanical Filter: The most popular type of filter is the corner filter that recycles water through the three-filtration stages. It usually sits at the top of the aquarium in the middle or in the corner and sucks up water through a tube and spits it out again.

Undergravel Filter: This filter provides good mechanical filtration since it is located underneath the gravel in plates, which forces the water to filter through the rocks, trapping and taking any fallen particles in the water.

Canister Filter: This high end filtration system operates by having multiple trays that mechanically, biologically, and chemically filter the water. It filters the water by pushing water from the bottom of the canister to the top.

Protein Skimmer: This filter is necessary if you have a saltwater aquarium. Protein skimmers remove dissolved organic materials from the water as opposed to other filtration systems that only trap it until you change the filter.

Set up your aquarium.,
Add water to your freshwater aquarium.,
Turn on your aquarium’s filter, lights, and heater.,
Wait a few days before adding fish to your tank.",How to Set Up an Aquarium2," Before buying your fish, you need to prepare the aquarium. A typical freshwater aquarium needs:



A tank. Your tank’s size should match the type and number of fish you plan to have. Generally, you should have an aquarium that can hold at least 5 gallons (20 litres) of water.

A filter. Keeping fish without a filter drastically shortens your fish’s life. Filters help oxygenate and clean the water, allowing your fish to breathe better in a clean environment.

Water treatments. Any water you add to your tank should be treated or dechlorinated. This protects your fish’s delicate mucus lining from harsh minerals and chemicals found in our drinking water and keeps it healthy.

Aquarium gravel. Gravel not only helps to keep decorations or live plants in place, but gravel also affects the water quality of your tank.

Heater and thermometer. Most freshwater fish need to live in temperatures ranging from 75 to 80 °F (24 to 27 °C). Some fish, such as tropical fish, will need to be placed in a tank with a higher temperature.Always research or consult with your local aquarium expert about what the correct temperature for your fish tank is.

Lights. The type of lighter you choose depends on what kind of fish or invertebrates you plan to have and whether or not you want to have live plants.

Decorations. These include fake or real plants, as well as rocks, caves, and other picturesque aquarium ornaments.

Airstones or air pumps. All tanks need to be well oxygenated. Airstones or air pumps add oxygen to the water by aggravating it.

Aquarium vacuum. There are several types of aquarium vacuums to choose from: ones that connect to faucets, ones that only suck up water, and ones that you need to pump.

Fish net. You’ll need to remove your fish from its tank for various reasons. Be sure to choose a net big enough to hold your fish.

Aquarium glass scrubber or sponge. Some glass scrubbers act as magnets that stick to the tank’s glass for easy clean up, while some are special sponges that are safe to use in your tank.

A large bucket. You’ll need a bucket or several buckets that can hold a large amount of water for when you need to do water changes.

Aquarium test kits. To maintain your tank’s water quality, you will need to test your tank’s pH, ammonia, and nitrogen levels regularly.

Fish food. Be sure to provide your fish with the correct diet. Not all fish can just eat fish flakes or pellets everyday.

, Never use soap or detergents to clean your tank. Using soaps or detergents can seriously injure and damage your tank inhabitants. Simply wash your tank and equipment with hot water.


Use a sponge or clean washcloth and scrub the inside of your tank. Then hose it down to rid your tank of any impurities.
Wash and soak your aquarium gravel or sand in a bucket. Use a pasta strainer to separate the dirtied water from the gravel.
Wash and massage your filter’s cartridges under the tap or in a bucket. This is very important, especially if you’re using a carbon filter. Massaging or rubbing the filter activates the carbon inside the cartridge.
Wash all decorations in clean water.

, This means putting your tank on its stand, filling the tank with gravel, arranging your decorations and airstones, and setting up the lighting and heating for your aquarium.

If you are using an undergravel filter, place the bottom plates into your tank and attach all necessary tubes, airline, gang valves, and air pumps before adding your gravel.
Don’t plug in your filter. Set it up and place it in the correct position but don’t turn it on until you have water in the tank. Having it on without water can damage your filter.

, It’s vital you treat your water with conditioner to remove chlorine and chloramine. You can find water conditioners at your local pet store with instructions on how much to add depending on how big of a tank you have.


Don’t fill the tank with water until you are sure of your aquarium’s layout. It can get quite messy if you stick your hand in a full tank to move things around.
Place a plate over your gravel to avoid messing up your tank layout. Pour water directly onto the plate so the pressure of a stream of water won’t make a hole in your gravel or move your decorations around. Remove the place once your tank is full.

, This will begin your tank’s nitrogen cycle.


Ensure your tank is safe electrically before turning or plugging everything in. A power cord in the wrong place can cause serious injury to you.

, The nitrogen cycle takes a few days for it to completely stabilize. You might notice your tank becoming cloudy which means the cycle is kicking in.


You can add some hardy fish like feeder goldfish to your tank to speed up the nitrogen cycle. However, don’t expect the fish to survive, as the harsh conditions of a new aquarium can be quite stressful and inhospitable.
Use a nitrate testing kit to ensure your aquarium is at its best quality before adding your fish.

Your substrate will be cleaned after your aquarium is set up.

, This means putting your tank on its stand, arranging your power heads, and setting up the lighting and heating for your aquarium.


If you are adding a live rock, do not add substrate or decorations to your tank. You must cure your live rock before you can do this.
Don’t plug in your filter. Set it up and place it in the correct position but don’t turn it on until you have water in the tank. Having it on without water can damage your filter.

, The saltwater mix you purchased should have detailed instructions on how to prepare your saltwater. Generally, you will be mixing room temperature water with the salt mix in a bucket or several buckets. If you don’t have enough buckets, you will need to prepare your water in parts or mix the salt right in the tank.


Check your salt levels with your refractometer. Typically, the specific gravity reading should be between 1.021 and 1.024 depending on the temperature of your water. Measuring the specific gravity of your saltwater means measuring the density of your water since adding salt to water increases the density of water., If you have FOWLR tank, you will need to start the process of curing your live rock, which could take up to 2 months to complete. To begin the process:


Turn on your aquarium. This means turning on the lighting, the heating, the filters, and the power heads.
Place your live rock in the tank. You may need to drain some water from the tank to accommodate your live rock. You should also place it in a position where it is in the middle of the tank and several or all power heads are aimed at it. The power heads will help blow off the debris from the rock.
Prepare saltwater to do a partial water change. A few days before, mix a new bucket of saltwater and wait for it to reach the same specific gravity reading of your tank.
Do a partial water change and scrub your live rock every few days. Turn off the power and take a brush like a toothbrush, and scrub your rock to remove any dead or dying organisms. You can do this directly in the tank. Then, vacuum the debris from the tank and change the water.
Use a test kit to determine your tank has 0 ammonia and 0 nitrates. Before your live rock is completely cured, your tank should look and smell pretty bad. You’ll know when the process is over when your tank begins to smell like the ocean.

, Before adding any substrate to your tank, you will need to prepare a bucket of saltwater to help clean it. Add your substrate into the bucket and stir. This allows the dust and dirt from your substrate to rise for you to siphon out with your aquarium vacuum. Use a cup or ladle to add your clean substrate to the tank.


You will need to drain more water out of your aquarium to accommodate the addition of your substrate and any decorations.

, Thoroughly check your aquarium’s water salinity, pH, ammonia, nitrate, and hardness levels using your test kits before adding any fish. The ideal readings for a saltwater aquarium with a live rock are:Temperature: 75°F - 82°F (24°C - 28°C)

Specific gravity: 1.020 - 1.024

pH: 8.0 - 8.4

Ammonia: 0

Nitrite: 0

Nitrate: 30 ppm or less (especially for invertebrates)

Alkalinity or carbonate hardness: 8 - 12 dKH

Obtain a suitable bucket.,
Procure a vacuum kit.,
Connect the vacuum.,
Wash and rinse your hands well.",How to Start a Siphon (Fish Tank)1," You are going to need a bucket that can hold a lot of water. However, you must also keep in mind the weight of the bucket when full. For example, a gallon of water weighs a bit over 8 pounds, which means a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket full of water would weigh in at 40+ pounds, if completely full., Pet stores selling aquarium supplies often sell inexpensive vacuum kits. These consist of about a 2 inch (5.1 cm) (or larger) diameter by 6 to 18 inch (15.2 to 45.7 cm) rigid plastic tube. This tube will be open at one end, with a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) diameter opening at the other end. Included in this kit will also be a fairly long length of 1/2"" clear, flexible tubing. The 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) flexible tubing should be of sufficient length to reach from the furthest point inside the tank, over the tank top and downward into the bucket., Connect the wide rigid tube to the 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) flexible tube (if not already connected). The object of weekly maintenance is to remove solid waste and change about 25% of the water in the tank. This siphon procedure will do both at the same time., Before placing your hands in the tank, be sure to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and warm water, and rinse well. Marine life and plants can react negatively to dirt, bacteria, and even soap.

Position your bucket.,
Place your siphon tube in the aquarium.,
Flood the vacuum and tube.,
Seal the discharge opening.,
Lift the discharge opening.,
Direct the water into your bucket.,
Stop water flow.",How to Start a Siphon (Fish Tank)2," The bucket may be placed anywhere, so long as the top of the bucket is below the bottom of the tank. If the tank is very large, additional tubing and coupling(s) may be required. Cut off any excess tubing, if desired., Begin by placing the vacuum end (the larger opening) of your tube inside your aquarium. You will want to keep the end of the siphon tube several inches above the gravel. Take the opposite end of your siphon tube, and point it toward your bucket.If the siphon you are starting has a “gravel vacuum” attached to it, you can rest the open end on top of the aquarium gravel.

, Place the vacuum opening (the larger tube opening) into the fish tank, so that water displaces the air in the tube. Then, slowly lower the remaining length of tubing into the tank. (Water should continue to displace the air from the entire length of the tubing.) If done correctly, there will be very little air left in the tubing.







, Grab the discharge opening (the other, more narrow end of the flexible tube). With the vacuum opening still submerged, seal the discharge opening by pressing a finger over it. Do not break the seal., Lift the end of the tube with the discharge opening up and out of the tank. Lower it down into your bucket, maintaining the seal. Make sure the vacuum end is still against the tank bottom, and remove your finger from the discharge end of the tube. Water will begin to flow from the tank into the bucket.







, Keep the discharge end directed into the bucket, while you gently move the vacuum end around the tank bottom. It may be useful to have a second person on hand to help you.








, When you have removed enough water, you can stop the water flow by raising the discharge end to a point slightly higher than the aquarium.









You will need to flood the vacuum and tube again if additional siphoning needs to be performed.

"
"
Position your bucket.,
Position the tube.,
Initiate suction.,
Direct the water into the bucket.,
Stop the flow.",How to Start a Siphon (Fish Tank)3," Another method for starting a siphon it to you use your mouth to initiate the suction. To accomplish this, first place your bucket on a surface lower than your fish tank.

, Next, place the vacuum end (larger opening) of your tube at the bottom of your fish tank. Keep the vacuum end a few inches above the gravel, unless you have a gravel vacuum attached. (If using a gravel vacuum, the tube can rest directly on the gravel.)

, To initiate the suction and get the water flowing, place your mouth on the discharge opening (the smaller end of the tube) and suck lightly. Ensure that the end of the tube is lower than the container from which you are siphoning water.

, As soon as the water begins to flow, quickly remove your mouth and place the discharge opening into your bucket. Then simply allow the water to flow. Move the vacuum end of the tube around the tank to suck up dirt and debris.

, When enough water has been removed, lift the discharge end of the tube so that it is higher than the fish tank. This will stop the flow of water. If you want to siphon more water, you will need to begin the procedure again."

,, Place it securely in its new home, and if possible check to make sure it is level. Remember, unless it is a very small tank, once it is full you should never attempt to move it. Moving a tank with water in it can lead to disaster.

, If you plan on using live plants, consider researching what substrate is best to use. Remember, some fish have specific requirements on what substrate/gravel they need. You will need approximately 250g of gravel per liter of tank (depending on your setup). It is important to have enough gravel as gravel is a place for good bacteria to grow on(more on those later). You will want to rinse your gravel well before placing it in a tank to remove dust and debris from travel. If you are using an undergravel filtration system install this now. Scoop the gravel into your tank slowly so you do not damage or scratch the glass. Generally it is best to create a gentle slope of gravel; deepest in the back and most shallow in the front.

, Place a small, clean dish on the gravel floor of the aquarium, and pour water into this dish if you wish to avoid displacing the gravel. If you are a beginner fish keeper, it will be easiest for you to use tap water.

, Good brands will also remove chlorine, ammonia, and nitrite). Be sure to follow the instructions on the package.

, Remember to use only safe decor for a freshwater aquarium. Not all rock types are safe for freshwater aquariums- research or ask your local fish shop what their recommendation is. Consider what species you are going to keep- décor for an aquarium full of African Cichlids would be different than for goldfish, for example.

, Each filter is different so be sure to follow instructions. Once it is hooked up properly, you may plug it in and ensure that it operates properly. If you are using a canister style filter, consider attaching the spray bar so that it agitates (creates ripples) on the surface of the water. This will help dissolve oxygen for your fish. All other types of filters should normally agitate the water.

, Follow instructions carefully! Some heaters are fully submersible, some or not. Wait at least 30 minutes before plugging your heater in! If you fail to do this you run the risk of causing the heater to shatter due to thermal inversion. Set the heater at a proper temperature. This may take some fiddling depending on your heater model.

, Ideally most tropical freshwater fish enjoy a constant temperature in the 24 °C (75 °F) - 28ºC range. Research the species you wish to keep to learn about specific temperature requirements.

, Note that most lighting will work for any species you keep, however additional research should be preformed if you wish to keep live plants. Live plants often require more than standard lighting. Some fish keepers find that attaching their light to a timer is beneficial.

, A drip loop is a U-shape in the cord, so that if any water were to drip down the cord, it will fall to the floor instead of running into an electrical socket!

, Test for pH, carbonate hardness(KH), General Hardness(GH), Nitrites, Nitrates, and Ammonia. You should not have any Ammonia, Nitrite or Nitrate yet, unless your tap water contains these. Calcium carbonate (hardness) ties in to pH. If you have very soft water, the pH of your tank can become unstable. If your water is soft, add conditioning salt & KH Powder to your tank to prevent a pH crash. Most freshwater fish can live in a pH from 6.5 to 8.0. (7.0)is Neutral and preferred by most fish. Ask your aquarium to test your tap water for its pH level. If your pH ranges are above or below, ask the staff at your local aquarium for advice.

Remember that fish are very adaptable. They are more likely to get sick from a fluctuating pH than a stable but less than perfect one.






Test your pH at least once per month and never let it drop below 6.0.

, Grab a book or hop on the Internet and decide what kinds of fish you might like. You will need to wait at least 48 hours before adding your first fish. Adding too many fish too quickly is usually the worst of beginner's mistakes and usually leads to total tank failure.

, Adding fish is the most exciting part of setting up the tank! Unfortunately, it is often the worst mistake unless done properly. By following these steps, you will help to avoid the heartbreak of having all your fish die:


Let your tank run without anything in it for at least 48 hours. This helps the temperature stabilize. It allows you to make sure your water parameters are safe, and gives the dust and all parts of your tank to settle.
If you plan on keeping live plants, add them. They will help jump start the biological process needed to support live fish in your tank.
Take time to understand that your tank is not just a fancy cage for your fish. It is an entire ecosystem. Fish produce lots of ammonia- they produce it when they defecate, and they produce it as they breathe. That's what the filter is for, right? Well, yes and no. The filter only works properly when it is full of nitrifying bacteria. These are the good bacteria necessary to support your live fish. Without these bacteria, the ammonia that your fish make stays in the water and poisons your fish. Your brand new tank, being clean and newly set up, does not contain these good bacteria. If you add a group of fish without letting this bacteria grow in your tank, you are dooming your fish. This bacteria takes anywhere from 2-6 weeks to populate! So, what do you do? There are several methods of 'breaking in' or 'cycling' a tank... So, Cycle your tank.
If you know someone with a tank that has been set up for more than two months and with healthy fish, you can borrow some used filter media from them. Keep the media wet until you add them to your tank (gotta keep those good bacteria alive!). The good bacteria will have a jump start in populating your tank. If you don't know a friend with fish, you can purchase live bacteria in several forms from your local aquarium.

, If possible, add no more than 1-2 smaller fish per 40 liters. For the first week, feed them very sparingly (a tiny amount) every other day. This is not cruel- remember if you overfeed at this point it may kill them. If you have your own test kit you can test your water daily, keeping a special eye on the Ammonia and Nitrite levels. If at any time the Ammonia or Nitrite spike to a dangerous level, perform a 20-30% water change. Never remove more than 30% at this stage (or you run the risk of killing your good bacteria off) and always replace with dechlorinated water. After a week it should be suitable for you to add a few more fish, and repeat the process. Barring any problems, you should have a stable tank within 4-6 weeks. After your tank is stable, you can feed on a regular schedule and can add fish as you desire. Remember: adding a large number of fish at a time sometimes causes the tank to become temporarily imbalanced, so use caution. Also remember that your tank can only support a limited number of fish per liter. This number depends on how large the fish is and its eating habits.

Get your aquarium.,
For your main filtration, use an all-natural method.,
Place the tank in a good location.,
Use the correct type of water to fill the tank.,
Proceed to fill the tank with water and add salt, following the manufacturers directions for adding the salt.

,
Keep adding salt until the specific gravity is 1.023.,
Put in the heater.,
Place the live rock in first, using an open pattern so the fish have room to swim through and hide in the rock.,
You must then cycle the aquarium in order to avoid any livestock death.,
When your aquarium has fully completed cycling and you're confident all water parameters look stable, you will be ready to add a fish and a coral.,
Make sure to do your homework and research the species of fish and coral you're thinking of keeping; (try to offer them foods they would get naturally from the ocean).",How to Set up a Miniature Reef Aquarium," To start, you will need to pick out the aquarium you would like to use.


Three good starter sizes are the standard 14 gallon (53.0 L), 29 gallon (109.8 L), or 40 gallon (151.4 L) aquariums. Next, you will need to decide on the lighting system you want to use.
You may choose from may different kinds of lights. The most commonly used are PCs(Power Compacts), Fluorescent tube bulbs (the best being T5s) and Metal Halides being the ultimate reef lighting system producing brilliant shimmering effects. You may purchase any of the commonly available lights which include Sunpod, Orbit and Outer Orbit, Nova Extreme, and others just to name a few. You may also notice that bulbs have different Kelvin (kelvins are a measure of color temperature) ratings such as 6500ks 10,000ks (or 10ks) 12,000ks and 20,000ks (or 20ks) plus actinic . All are appropriate for reef tanks but 10ks, 12ks, and 20ks with actinic are recommended. 6500ks are a warm red, 10,000ks are a crisp white and 20,000ks a cool blue. Actinics are a deep purple which cause certain corals and fish to fluoresce. Most people put on there actinics for 2 hours then put there other type on for 8 hours with actinics, followed by 2 more hours of actinics. This creates a dusk dawn effect, but is not necessary. For your average soft coral reef tank you need only 4 watts per gallon, and for a stony coral, tank 8 or more watts per gallon is needed.
For the heater, it is recommended using a 50w or 75w Ebo Jager brand heater, as users of these have consistently had success in such small aquariums. You may not need a heater as your light fixture produce a lot of heat unless your house is very cold. Lastly, you will need a small Powerhead for circulation with a turnover rate of 20 times (For a 10 gallon a powerhead rated at 200gph) and an adequate filter. You can use a power filter, a wet-dry filter, or canister filter. The best filter system would be an under tank sump, with a Protein Skimmer, (To remove dissolved organic material which can pollute your tank) a mechanical filter, (to remove solid particles IE filter floss or mesh pad) chemical filter (IE Carbon in a filter sock) and a calcium reactor for a stony coral reef.
It's important that you make sure to plug all equipment into a ground fault circuit before plugging them into the standard home outlet. Do this in conjunction with using a grounding rod inside your aquarium.;
, Good quality cured live rock and live sand is the key to starting a successful system. You will want to use at least one pound of cured live rock per gallon, and about one-half pounds of live sand per gallon.

, When you look for a location to place your nano reef, you will want to keep a few things in mind. The tank should be placed on a level and sturdy surface that can support approximately 70-250 pounds depending on the size of the tank. For the beginner, it's recommended to place the tank in a high traffic area, so that it will be under constant supervision, especially in the beginning while the tank is still stabilizing.

, When the time comes to fill the tank with water, you will need good de-chlorinated water; it's recommended to use reverse osmosis water, you can find R.O. water from most local pet fish stores.


You will also need to have good quality synthetic reef salt and a specific gravity meter (hydrometers are more commonly used).
Floating hydrometers can be purchased for under $10 and will provide a basic reading of the specific gravity (salt concentration in ppm's parts per millionth). A more expensive Refractometer is recommended for highly accurate readings, if money allows that is.

,, Place the Powerhead in immediately so it will help mix the salt.

, Now is also the time to place in your heater and get the water temperature to 78 degrees. Once your specific gravity has reached its proper level and the water has begun to stabilize, (this time will vary depending on your particular set up), you can add the live rock and live sand.

, Be as creative as you want during this process and don't be afraid to go back and change it later. Once the rock is where you like it, you can pour the live sand around the rocks, keeping it at a fairly even thickness throughout the tank. Adding the live sand in will cloud the water, but don't worry it will eventually settle and the water will clear.

, This is done by adding a source of ammonia, which could be fish food. If you do not do this, your first fish will add this ammonia, which will almost inevitably cause it's death. You must then check the ammonia level every 2 or 3 days until it drops to zero. You then repeat the process with nitrites and then nitrates. Once they are all zero you may add your first fish. Nitrates may be up to 20ppms. The best test kits available are Salifert although you may use a cheaper brand.

, But don't rush this process; take your time to be rewarded in the saltwater hobby.

, This way you'll know how to care for them, when you get the little guys to their new home.

Cycle the tank with a fishless cycle additive i.e.",How to Set up a Small Reef Aquarium," This guide is for tanks less than 30 gallons (113.6 L). Decide on the location of the aquarium in your home. This place should have lots of circulation and have zero exposure to direct sunlight. Tanks of this size can be placed on a sturdy piece of furniture. You can also purchase a pre-manufactured stand which may increase the warranty on an aquarium. Also be sure to get the items in the ""Things You'll Need"" section.;
, Always Use R.O.D.I. water. Tap water will not work and will lead to massive algae break outs as most tap water has many phosphates and silicates. If you do not have an R.O. unit, buying premixed water from a reputable local fish store is a great option. You may also experiment with distilled water from the store however if the water has copper in it (distilled in copper containers), it will kill coral. Be sure to leave about two to four inches at the top of the tank.

, Continue adding salt and stirring and checking salinity until the hydrometer reads somewhere between 1.022-1.025. With a new hydrometer you will frequently get air bubbles stuck to the needle, these will seriously throw off a reading. Tap it up and down and left and right until they float off. Once you have an appropriate salinity take a break and let the water clear up. Pour the water into the aquarium. Check it again and proceed to the next step.

, Slice open one side of the bag and slide it out very gently. It is similar to the magician pulling out the tablecloth, but a lot slower. If you do this properly the tank will hardly cloud at all. If you don't, you will have to wait longer for the water to clear so you can see through the aquarium. (You may use sand bought at the pet store or live sand bought from a local reef store)

, Read the directions for the test kit they vary in methods. Alkalinity reading should be 8-12 dKH. Calcium should be at 400-500 ppm. If either tests low, add an appropriate amount of alkalinity increase or calcium increase.

, Keep in mind that you will need to clean the glass so leave enough room on any sides you will be cleaning, really important on the front pane. It is also advisable to stack the rock in an arch formation with many open holes and few touching regions.

, Place the filter in a place where it will maximize the flow in the aquarium. The middle works better than the sides. If you are using two filters place them on opposite sides but not on the edges. Read the directions thoroughly before you plug them in. Make sure the filters are running properly.

Add one fish at a time.",How to Set up a Healthy Goldfish Aquarium," For instance, if you own single-tailed goldfish, you’ll need 40 gallons of water per fish. However, if you own fancy goldfish with small bodies and double tails, you’ll only need ten to twenty gallons per fish.The more space your fish have, the healthier they will be.


The reason you need such a big tank for goldfish is that they produce a lot of waste during digestion.Get a twenty-gallon tank for one fancy goldfish.
Pick a forty-gallon tank for two fancy goldfish or for one single-tailed goldfish.;
, You’ll want a spot that is close to a power supply and a water source. It should get some natural sunlight but shouldn’t be directly in front of a sunny window. Since a consistent temperature is important, you’ll also want to avoid a drafty location.If you are not breeding the goldfish, you want to maintain a consistent temperature of 23 Celsius (74 Fahrenheit).
Because goldfish normally live in a fairly bright tropical environment, they need some sunlight during the day and darkness at night.
If you use an aquarium light, you’ll need to turn it off at night so that your goldfish can rest.
If your goldfish don’t get enough light, their color will fade.

, Because a full goldfish tank is very heavy, you’ll need a tank stand or a very sturdy piece of furniture. If you have a very large tank, you’ll also want to position it so that the weight is evenly distributed across your floor joists.A ten-gallon goldfish tank will weigh approximately 100 pounds.
A 100-gallon tank weighs about half a ton.

, Because goldfish produce more waste than other fish, you’ll need a really strong filtration system.You’ll need a very strong flow rate, which is the amount of water filtered per hour. Pick a filtration system that moves at least five and as much as ten times the volume of your tank per hour. Although both internal and external filtration systems will do the trick, you’re more likely to get that kind of flow rate with an external system.If you are using a twenty-gallon tank, you’ll need a flow rate of 100-200 gallons per hour.
If you have a forty-gallon tank, you’ll need a flow rate of 200-400 gallons per hour.
Undergravel filters are only recommended if you're on a budget or if you're keeping sharpness sensitive goldfish such as the Bubble Eye.
Canister filters are best for large tanks.

, Fill a bucket halfway up with gravel. Run water over the gravel and agitate it with your hands. You should see dirt and sediment rising up from the gravel. Dump out the sediment and rinse it again. When it looks clean, you can add three or four inches to the bottom of the tank.If you are using an undergravel filter, you’ll need to install it prior to adding the gravel.
A recommended gravel size is 1/8’’ (3 mm).
Goldfish tend to put small gravel in their mouth, so you should avoid smaller gravel sizes.

, Pick some colorful rocks from your aquarium store, such as slate or red shale. Put the decorative rocks on top of the gravel. If you have any other special scenery, you can add it at this time., Run some clean, cold water into a bucket. Pour the water into the tank. At this point, you’ll want to make adjustments to the scenery. Try to make sure the fish have some hiding places but also plenty of room to swim around. If you have some plants that need to be secured in the gravel, you could make those adjustments., Fill a bucket with clean, cold water. Pour it into the tank until the water is close to the top of the tank.At this point, you can make any necessary adjustments to the filtration tubes. For instance, if you have an undergravel filter, you’ll want to make sure the lift tubes are halfway in and halfway out of the water.

, Although goldfish can withstand relatively cool temperatures, you’ll need to keep your tank warm to encourage strong growth and overall health. However, if you plan to breed your goldfish, you’ll need to introduce seasonal variations in water temperature.Use either an internal or an external aquarium thermometer to measure temperature.
If you want to breed your goldfish, keep the temperature at 10 Celsius (50 Fahrenheit) during the winter months. In the spring, raise the temperature to somewhere between 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit) and 23 Celsius (74 Fahrenheit) to encourage breeding.
Don’t let the temperature go above 30 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit). Your goldfish will get stressed out if the temperature gets that high.
Avoid extreme fluctuations in water temperature.

, Once you have your tank completely setup with everything except the goldfish, you’ll need to build up the good bacteria by adding ammonia. For every gallon of water in your tank, you’ll need to add one drop of ammonia. Every day, add the required number of drops of ammonia into your tank.If you have a ten-gallon tank, you’ll be adding ten drops of ammonia.
You can get bottled ammonia at the pet store.
You can also add fish food and let it decompose in your aquarium, which will add ammonia to the water.

, After adding ammonia for a few days, you’ll need to start testing the water for nitrites and ammonia.Take two water samples with the syringes included in your master test kit. Shake the solution for testing ammonia and add the number of drops indicated on the side of the bottle. Next, shake the solution for the nitrites and add the number of drops indicated on the side of the bottle. Finally, match the colors in the test tubes to the color chart to determine the concentration of ammonia and nitrite in your tank., After a few weeks of adding ammonia, you should be able to start testing for nitrates. Take a water sample with the syringe included in your master test kit. Shake the bottle for nitrates and add the required number of drops to the test tube. Match the color to the color chart to determine nitrate concentration. Also, test for ammonia and nitrites. If the ammonia and nitrite levels go down to zero but there is some nitrate, your tank is successfully cycled and ready for fish!You’ll still need to add ammonia to feed the good bacteria up until the day you add your goldfish.

, You’ll want to change half of your water in order to lower nitrate levels prior to adding your fish. To be safe, you should add one fish at a time. Since the aquarium is a very delicate setup, it is best to see how one fish lives in the tank before adding any more.After you add the one goldfish, you should keep testing the water for nitrates, ammonia, and nitrites. You want low levels of ammonia and nitrites, but some nitrates are fine.
You can add the next goldfish after testing the water for two weeks to make sure the tank is cycling properly and there is sufficient water volume in the tank to handle the additional fish.

",How to Set up a Marine Reef Aquarium," Put the tank in a area of the house which isn't drafty, near a radiator, near a window, in direct sunlight, or near other sources of fluctuating temperatures, for example kitchen areas . Also avoid areas which can get overly hot or very cold. Don't put it in a very busy area, but make sure you can see it enough to enjoy it!;
, Larger aquariums provide a much more stable environment, because the water chemistry will be easier to maintain over time.

, Acrylic will scratch easily but is easier to drill and is much lighter. You can buy a tank pre-drilled, or if you are handy do it yourself (using a diamond bit hole saw). Some fish shops and glass stores will also provide this service. A tank with an ""internal overflow"" is a big plus. These are often sold as ""reef ready"". It is better to choose a tank that is not too deep(e.g. 24 to 30"") so you can reach the bottom easily; a tank that is wider will provide a better depth of view for a more natural look as well as have better light penetration. A second smaller tank (a sump) is placed under the reef ready aquarium and will hold all the equipment out of sight. A sump is not a need per se, but it is nice to be able to hide equipment in as well as increasing the overall water volume in your system.
, 250 watts bulbs will suit most common aquariums except for the deeper ones where 400 w bulbs provide more light penetration.The color spectrum of the bulbs (expressed in color temperature in Kelvins) is a matter of personal preference. Bulbs between 10,000 kelvin and 20,000 kelvin are the most popular, and the higher the kelvin rating the 'bluer' the color. Some claim coral growth is affected by the color, but corals grow fast and successfully on either end of the 'spectrum'. One halide bulb for every 2–3 feet (0.6–0.9 m) of tank length is usually recommended.

, Two popular kinds are Power Compact and T5, or T5HO (meaning T5 high output). These can be found in many of the same color ratings as metal halide bulbs, and are often cheaper and produce less heat than a metal halide. A popular choice is to use both fluorescent and metal halide. The main thing to keep in mind when choosing a fluorescent T5 fixture is to make sure to buy one with individual reflectors. While the lights do put out a fair amount of light with regular parabolic reflectors, they become amazingly bright using individual reflectors. Many people choose to use a single color of metal halide, like 10000k, and will use a few blue (or Actinic) fluorescents to make the color more pleasing.

, If you have chosen to buy a larger tank (40+ gallons) a protein skimmer is a very important piece of equipment to purchase. Get a good quality protein skimmer and place it in your sump or on the back of your tank if it is designed for it. Do not skimp on this. Often protein skimmers are under-rated for the size of tank, so in practice a skimmer rated for a 100 gallon (378.5 L) tank is barely adequate for a 50 gallon (189.3 L) reef tank (especially one with many fish that get fed a lot). Needle wheel skimmers are a popular choice, and can be very effective for their size/cost. Don't rely on 'venturi' skimmers, unless they are high end models with very strong pumps. Don't bother buying 'canister' filters, often used on freshwater aquariums. Not only are they fairly useless in a marine aquarium environment, they can cause a buildup of Nitrates on their internal media that can negatively effect the aquarium. That being said, a canister filter can be used for carbon or other chemical media, provided it is cleaned on a regular basis.


A skimmer quickly becomes cheaper than salt-water changes.
If the aquarium is not heavily stocked and does not have delicate (or very valuable) fish, try putting the skimmer and even the filter on a timer--though there must always be some circulation such as from powerheads--to allow everything to filter-feed during the day and have its water cleaned thoroughly at night.

, Additional powerhead pumps in the tank or external pump(s) should be installed to provide additional vigorous turbulent flow to otherwise stagnant areas, which is crucial to the survival of your future corals.

,, The high intensity lighting used in reef aquariums adds a surprising amount of heat to the aquarium, making it harder to keep a reef aquarium 'cool' enough. Although heat issues are not as much of a problem in cooler countries like Canada, you'd be surprised just how much the heat can creep up on a warm day in your tank. The point is to try to keep the temperature variation minimal. The less your temp. varies throughout the day and night, the more stable your marine environment will be.

, Run all your pumps. Turn the sump pump off to see how much water drains into it. Use a piece of tape to mark your ""maximum"" water line. That is the maximum amount of water that can be in your sump before it overflows. You can also put a piece of tape down for the minimum fill line, which is the minimum amount of water required in your sump to get the pump to work and not blow air into your display. Run the water level somewhere between those two lines. The chamber housing your pump is usually the one in which you will notice a drop in the water level due to evaporation. There are auto top off kits available to top your water off daily with fresh dechlorinated water(no salt). Alternatively, you can top off manually by marking where you want your water level to be and then keeping it full to that line with fresh dechlorinated water (preferably RO/DI).

, Use only a good aquarium sea salt brand and purified water with a Reverse Osmosis or R0/DeIonization Filter. Another option is to fill the tank with RO/DI water and then add the salt. The importance of RO/DI system cannot be understated. Tap water can be used, but your aquarium is then at the mercy of whatever harmful chemicals may be in it. A good RO/DI system is not too expensive, and should be considered a necessity. A 100 gallon (378.5 L) per day model is a good choice, because you won't have to wait too long to make purified water which is a nice convenience. If your tank is smaller you can purchase bottled RO water at your local store. Use of distilled water is not recommended as most distillation units use copper pipes. Copper is toxic to most invertebrates; including corals, decorative shrimp, etc.

, It takes a little time for your salt to dissolve and your water chemistry to stabilize, and the action of the pumps will drive out excess carbon dioxide (which initially causes a low pH). You can add sand if you choose to, either before adding your water (if it is not a live bed) or after. If it is a ""live"" sand bed, add it after you have mixed your saltwater in the tank. Leave the skimmer off until the sand settles. A sand depth of 4 to 5"" is recommended for maximal detritus biological processing (at this depth only seasoned hobbyists as at 4 to 5 inches many nasty things can grow as well -research aerobic and anaerobic sand beds for reef tanks).. Some folks prefer the look of the sand bed, but don't want the possible ""old tank syndrome"" that can come with having a deep sand bed. (Old tank syndrome happens when the sand bed has accumulated more detritus than it can handle and may result in a ""tank crash"" if pockets of toxic H2S are stirred up in the bed.) A 1-2"" sand bed can also be used as long as the detritus is vacuumed out on a regular basis ( this is actually the preferred depth, especially for beginners).

, This is called ""bare bottom"". It is much easier to keep the tank clean with a bare bottom, as you can easily siphon out the detritus. It's not as pleasing to the eye perhaps, but for many people, the ease of keeping it clean makes up for that fact.

, The rock can be placed on an aragonite sand bed, or alternatively you can add the rock prior to the sand. Live rock can be obtained online, from other hobbyists or at your local marine aquarium store.

, Inserting bits of frozen fish foods in the sand bed can speed the cycle. (This is unnecessary if you added live rock. There are plenty of dead crustaceans and worms already inside due to shipping). This may take 1 to 6 weeks. Algae blooms can be a natural part of the cycle. Check and make sure the salinity is stable at 1.023 to 1.026. This does not mean it can be 1.023 one day and 1.026 the next. Find the salinity you want and keep it at that level. 1.025-1.026 is the optimum salinity for corals; a lower salinity is inappropriate for inverts/coral. A fish only tank can be kept at 1.021-1.026. Compensate for evaporated water losses with RO/DI water. Keep the temperature, Calcium and Alkalinity levels stable. Do not use commercial ""supplements"" other than water changes unless you know what you are doing. Algae blooms are common for probably the first 6 months of your aquarium, so don't be alarmed to find new algae growing. Just keep it clean and do about a 10% water change every week. Once your tank is stable you may choose to slow down the water changes. Ensure the new water has been heated and mixed for a while in a separate container prior to putting it in your tank.

,


If this is your first reef aquarium, get just one to three inexpensive fish that will be compatible with a variety of other fish including any specific exotic kinds you may want later. Being inexpensive means not only that they will not be a big monetary loss if they die, but that they are strong (thus plentiful) and less likely to die. Being few (and small, which tends to go along with inexpensive) means they are unlikely to overload the biological filtration as you start out.

, A 'mature' tank is much more suitable for growing coral. A good rule of thumb is to watch your live rock. At some point you will notice your rock or your glass developing spots of purple. The purple encrustation you see is called coralline algae. The right conditions for coralline are correspondent with the right conditions for coral. You will seen new crustaceans, worms, feather dusters, coralline and more. Once you see this marker, assuming your test kits still read 0 for ammonia and nitrite, and less than 20ppm for nitrate, you can begin to add coral.

Enjoy the sight of your creatures among your nice plants!",How to Set Up a Plant‐Only Aquarium," Just because you don’t have any fish doesn't mean you can skimp on the basics, including:

A simple filter of your choosing (hang-on back filters are the easiest to find and are suitable for most tanks),
A tank light for growing plants, secured properly for safety. Different plants need different light levels, so do research and plan your tank accordingly.
An air pump (with airstones and airline tubing). It does not need to be strong, but needs to disturb the water and add oxygen to prevent stagnant water buildup.
If your tank’s water temperature reaches cool extremes, it’s best to invest in a heater as well.
Sunlight is not a suitable replacement for tank lights! It can heat up the tank; it's unregulated, and accelerates algae growth, so keep your tank away from it.;
, Wash such material with normal tap water, thoroughly.

You can skip decorations, but substrate is vital in planted tanks. Keep in mind that certain plants do better with certain substrates.

, Use a proper water conditioner to prepare; don't just aerate the water. You might also add aquarium salt (1 tbsp per 5 US gallons) to ward off unsightly parasites, but aquatic plants usually don’t have many parasitic animals plaguing them. But if you add invertebrates, then do add sea salt for them.

Don’t, as yet, add the plant fertilizer (substrate or water soluble).

, You must not skip this even if you only want plants. Plants die over time, and a proper bacterial filtration system will make sure ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates don’t skyrocket.

While some (not a lot!) of nitrates are vital to the plants’ growth -- ammonia and nitrites are toxic to them. Plants handle the chemicals better than fish do, but it’s better to err on the caution side.

, Of course, buy freshwater plants. As mentioned before, light requirements are a big factor. If your light is not strong enough (or too strong), then revise your plans. Think about nutritional requirements and how each plant grows. Larger plants shade over others if not arranged properly, blocking out light. All of the plants need to coexist peacefully.

Buy from reputable sites. A snail-free promise should be searched for, as snails can reproduce quickly to decimate your tank.
Research carefully. Some “aquatic” plants actually should not be fully submerged. It’s great to use these, but don’t put them fully in the water. They will rot.
Many plants are fine with gravel, but some do poorly in sand. Keep this in mind.

, This is the artsy part of aquascaping. Tall, bushy plants should be near the back to provide a background. Shorter, weedier plants can be in the middle. Smaller, stunningly beautiful plants can be in the front as a centerpiece. Put the airstone in between plants to hide it, if you want. Try to use your imagination to build underwater scenes that have a natural feel to them.

If you included natural wood décor, there are “mosses” or other plants that flourish on floating wood. Add them to the wood!
A good example would be an underwater “meadow”. Hairgrass, wood, and rocks are used to create the illusion of a scene usually seen on ground.

, There are different forms of nutrients, from pellets to solutions. Add the right amount according to your tank and follow instructions to the T. Since there are no fish (even if you will add invertebrates), there will be minimal waste for the plants to utilize. This is key to a healthy tank.

Follow suppliers' instructions. Don’t just put in whatever seems reasonable. Too much can burn the roots and plants or mess up water chemistry.

, Rinse off debris with normal tap water and snip off any yellow or dead parts. Hopefully, you’ve devised a plan on how to arrange them by size and kinds, so work logically. Some plants have a rhizome similar to roots -- but some of those should not be buried, so be careful to read each of their requirements.

Plants that grow on wood can be tucked into crevices or held in place gently by a temporary, weak rubber band.
Rooted plants should have their roots tucked completely into the substrate.
Floating plants can be anchored to aquarium weights or rocks, or left to freely wander.

, Even if less waste is being produced than in a fish tank, the nitrates will eventually build up. Depending on whether you put special invertebrates in (see “Adding Invertebrates”) depending on your tank size, and your number of plants, this frequency will change. This is a general rule. Replace 25% of the water, correctly treated and with aquarium/sea salt for health of freshwater fish if you want.

Once in a while, use your gravel or substrate vacuum to clean the substrate surface of rotting organic matter.

, If you use salt as an electrolyte or supplement for aquatic health, do not add salt to the water when you are only topping it off! When water evaporates from your tank, the salt does not evaporate with it. Adding more salt can make the tank too salty. As always, condition the water., Some substrate fertilizers last for a very long time and do not need to be bothered for months. Some liquid varieties require weekly additions, so make sure you keep up on that. A carbon dioxide supplement (recalling that plants make and give off oxygen but need carbon dioxide given off by fish and other animals) can be useful as well, added weekly, and does not harm any animal or plant if used with the correct proportions., Algae is not harmful unless it starts to block out light and suck up too many nutrients. A soft-padded brush (available at pet stores) easily gets the job done. Algae on plants is usually fine. If it bothers you, lightly rub it off with your fingers.

Avoid too much algae by keeping the tank away from sun, not using too-strong lights, and not overdoing fertilizer/supplements.

, These should be added to an established planted tank. Common invertebrates such as mystery snails and shrimp actually function as tank “cleaners”, eating waste, dead matter. Many species are peaceful, but some can be incredibly aggressive. Some prefer open space, while others prefer hiding spaces. Be mindful.

Most pet store variety invertebrates only eat dead matter, but some do eat live plants. Furnishing their needs and protecting your aquatic plants can include putting in bits of plant material.

, Bright colors (if applicable), active movements, and an intact body indicate good health. Ask the pet supplier about the conditioning of their invertebrates tanks to get a sense of how they are handled by them. If you see a tank with dead or diseased organisms (even fish), it may be best to pass on the invertebrates in there.

Don’t be afraid to request particular sizes and kinds of specimens! This is common and acceptable.
Avoid buying baby invertebrates for an unestablished tank. They generally do not do well in a newly prepared tank.

, You should not add more than a few of any animal in at one time, to let the tank get used to it. Adding them in means that you should put them in a bucket of your tank water and gently scoop them out of the bag of store water. Dumping the bag’s contents into your tank can stress them and introduce questionable pet-store water into your water.

The best method to acclimate them is to simply float the animals’ bag in the tank water for at least 30 minutes.

, Giving them debris from cleaning a fish tank does not provide enough food for invertebrates. Giving them a balanced diet of bits of vegetables, pellets, or frozen foods ensures healthiness. You want to make your invertebrates part of the whole underwater scene, not just a side attraction. Feed them well and they will grow beautifully!

Inadequate feeding of vegetable food will push normal scavengers into eating your plants at times, so protect your plants by feeding adequately.
Remove food after a few hours/within the day if not eaten, to prevent mold/algae.

, Shrimp can enhance visual appeal of the tank, while tidying it. This type of tank can sustain/clean itself nicely, with animals and plants working together. Still, take care of your tank!"

Place the fish inside.",How to Set up a Guppy Tank," A ten gallon tank is the norm for guppies. Anything less will likely not cycle and you will be stuck cleaning water every couple of days.;

, Insert them and create a little hole (as if you were planting a real tree). Real plants are normally not much more expensive, give a better feel and fish generally don't eat them. Just be sure to check their living conditions before buying.

, Make sure the décor does not have any sharp or pointy objects on it. This could harm your fish by tearing their delicate fins. They can be quite fragile.

,


Note: Filters and heaters are nearly always necessary to keep water clean and tank heated to the correct temperature.

, Make sure that the water is about room temperature because it could kill the fish if it is way too cold or way too hot.

,, If you just got back from the pet shop, allow the fish bag to float on top of the water for at least 10 to 30 minutes while slowly replacing the bag water with tank water. This will allow the fish to slowly adjust and adapt to the water temperature and pH of the tank.


Slowly release the fish into the tank.

It’s best not to post anything inappropriate, embarrassing, or overly personal online.Try the “grandma test” as a rule of thumb: before sharing anything online, ask yourself if you would also show it to you grandmother. If not, it’s probably best to keep it private.;
, Most social networking sites and similar services allow you to control who sees what you post online. For instance, you can make your profile and posts private, so that only followers you accept can see your content.

Making your accounts private will limit outsiders from accessing your information, but won’t keep it totally secure.

, It’s easy to connect with lots of people online through social networking sites and in other ways. If you keep your online circles limited to people you know and trust, however, you are more likely to avoid being cyberbullied.

If the bully’s actions are repeated or severe, respond.

, If someone says something cruel online, it's tempting to say something mean about them.

Take it slow.,
Trust your instincts.",How to Safely Meet a Person You Met Online1," If you want to stay safe online, anonymity is the way to go. Don't even use your real first and last name, or list where you live or go to school. You don't want strangers online to know too much about you.With some dating apps, you have to enter your real location to get the most out of the app. Keep your location as general as you possibly can and still use the app properly. Be extra cautious who you talk to.
On some social media platforms, such as Facebook, you can create groups of friends and control who sees what information on your profile. For example, you could have your high school only visible to a group of your friends who went to high school with you, and invisible to everyone else.;
, Every social media platform or dating app has privacy settings that are designed to protect you. These settings allow you to control who can see specific information or posts you make.If you don't understand the way the privacy settings work, talk to a friend who can help explain them to you and get things set up the way you want.
Most social media platforms give you the option to view your profile the way a stranger would, so you can make sure you're not revealing more information than you want.

, Once you've started talking to someone regularly, it may be time to do a little online sleuthing before you meet up in person. Even if you don't have a lot of personal information about them, there are still ways you can determine if they are deceiving you.Look carefully at their page. If you have any friends in common, contact those people and ask how they know the person and if they've ever met them in real life.
Copy their photos and do an image search of them to see if they appear elsewhere on the internet. If someone is trying to pretend to be someone else, they may intend to harm you.
See how far back their page goes, and look at any comments or interactions they have with other friends or followers. You can usually tell by these interactions whether they actually personally know each other.

, In general, you want to avoid telling anyone too much about you until you've met them. Get to know them a little better before you tell them your address, your birthday, and your life history.This can be a delicate balance. If they are being safe, as you are, they won't reveal any personal information either. This can make it difficult to look into the person's background, but try to respect that they have the same privacy concerns you do.

, It can be easy to divulge too much information about yourself too quickly when you're talking online – especially if you talk to the person frequently. Keep your emotions in check and check yourself regularly to make sure you're not getting ahead of yourself.You don't want the person to know too much about you until you've met them in person at least two or three times. Keep conversations focused on common outside interests, such as music or movies, and avoid talking too much about your own life or your thoughts and feelings.

, When you make friends with somebody, it can be tempting to shrug off comments or behaviors that normally would give you pause. Keep in mind that this person is a stranger, and avoid giving them the benefit of the doubt.If the person says something that bothers you, mention it directly. Be honest, and don't allow them to think you're okay with something when you're not.
If you don't feel comfortable saying something to the person directly about something that's bothering you, that in and of itself is a red flag that maybe this person isn't the best friend for you.

Talk before meeting.,
Bring a friend.,
Avoid alcohol on your first meeting.,
Ask lots of questions.,
Keep your first meeting brief.,
Take personal belongings with you.,
Plan another meeting.",How to Safely Meet a Person You Met Online2," You may not want to meet too close to home if you're worried about the person knowing where you live. But at the same time, you don't want to meet someone for the first time in an unfamiliar part of town.Often you will feel more comfortable in a place where you've been several times, especially if you're anxious about meeting this person for the first time.
Ideally, you still want a place that you don't frequent often. If things don't work out, you don't want to risk running into that person again.
Plan your meeting during the day if at all possible. If the two of you are only available in the evening, choose a place that typically is fairly busy at the time you're planning to meet.

, Before you meet someone in person who you've met online, you want to make sure they are who they've said they are. The best way to go about this is to have a phone call or live video chat with them.If the person isn't able to video chat with you, ask them to take a selfie holding a sign with particular words on it. This can help assure you that they aren't pulling photos off the internet or otherwise deceiving you about who they are or what they look like.
If you and this person have developed a friendship to the point that you want to meet in person, they shouldn't have any problems doing this. If they refuse or make excuses, it could be a red flag.

, If you're really nervous about meeting the person, bring a friend along with you or organize a group date with several friends. If the person legitimately wants to get to know you, they shouldn't be put out that you want to meet in a group first.Especially if you're meeting the person further away from home, or in an unfamiliar part of town, bring someone along who knows that area.

, For people of drinking age, it's quite common to meet people at the local bar or pub. The problem is that alcohol can lower your inhibitions and cause you to lose control.If you do decide you want a drink, order a single drink with a low alcohol content, such as a light beer. Get a glass of water along with your beer, and sip slowly, alternating between the beer and the water.

, The point of meeting in person is to get to know each other better. Since the person might be more reserved in person than they were online, be prepared to ask questions to get them to open up.Referring back to a conversation you had online can help make both of you more comfortable. You'll be able to link the person in front of you to the conversations you had before.
For example, you might say ""I remember you telling me that Radiohead was your favorite band. Did you hear that they're playing a concert here in a few months?""

, For your initial meet-up, find some place you can sit and talk for a half hour or so, but don't plan on anything any longer than that. This way, if you find you're not interested in the person, you don't have to spend too much time with them.A short meeting gives the two of you the opportunity to sniff each other out and figure out if there's any connection in person as there is online.
Make a commitment with another friend so you have an easy out if the person tries to convince you to come somewhere else with them. Keep in mind a predatory person might try to lure you to a more private or out-of-the-way location.

, If you have to excuse yourself at any point, such as to use the restroom, do not leave your purse or cell phone unattended with the person you're meeting. Treat them as a stranger and don't give them access to your private information., If the first meeting went well, plan a second, longer meeting rather than extending the first meeting. This way you're continuing to take things slowly and you're remaining in control of the situation.Assuming your first meeting lasted 20 or 30 minutes, your second meeting should be a similar duration, maybe a little longer. You can work up to sharing a meal together or engaging in other activities.

You also may be able to talk to someone who works at the place where you met. Explain the situation to them and they may be able to help you.

, Before you meet up with the person, have several options in mind that will enable you to get out of the situation quickly if anything happens. Rely on your own transportation as much as possible.If you have your own car, drive to the meeting and park as close as you can. Don't go anywhere else where the person could potentially isolate you from your transportation.
Have a couple of options if you don't have your own car or are relying on public transportation.

, Always make sure that several people know exactly where you're going and when. Arrange for a friend to check in on you during the meeting so you can let them know if things aren't going well.Keep your phone on your person at all times, either with the ringer on or on vibrate so you won't miss this text or call.
You also can get a friend to drop by and act as though the two of you just ran into each other. Only try this if both you and your friend are capable of acting through the situation.

Remove the sick sheep from your herd.,
Call a vet to determine if it's viral or bacterial.,
Give the sheep medications to help with symptoms.,
Feed your sheep proper nutrition to help with recovery.,
Test for and remove any parasites.",How to Care for a Sheep With Pneumonia1," Pneumonia, in some cases, can quickly spread from one sheep to another and result in deaths. Take the afflicted sheep and put them in a quarantine separate from the rest of the herd making sure they do not share grazing land, food, or water supplies.


For recovery sake, you'll want them to be placed in a warm and dry environment. This will prepare them to weather symptoms better as humid environments can exasperate breathing problems and extreme temperatures can hinder recovery.;
, The vet can test for pneumonia using a simple blood test that can identify the presence of certain pathogens in the blood or use a chest x-ray. If it's viral, there are no medications to specifically help the pneumonia. However, they can provide an anti-biotic that will help with the complications of the viral infection. A bacterial infection can be treated using anti-biotic. , This is particularly critical in lambs.The most common types of medication given to sheep with pneumonia include: Naxcel and Nuflor. These are both given as injections for two to three days consecutively or as directed. If you are injecting your sheep, choose a muscular area, such as the back of the neck, to give the injection. Make sure to sanitize the injection site prior and have help to hold the sheep in case they become frightened. If your animal has a fever, give them an acetaminophen, such as Tylenol. The dosing should be 3 mg/kg of body weight. You can give these orally in your sheep's food. If they are not eating, your vet may give you a liquid or injectable form that can be forcibly administered.

, There are special vitamin mixtures given in addition to their normal diet that can give your sick sheep a boost such as SheepDrench. These vitamin mixtures can be purchased at any feed store. You will also want to give them a probiotic paste to help promote good digestion while using anti-biotics. Add soybean meal or beet pulp to give the food a high burst of nutrition. In extreme cases, the sheep may stop eating altogether despite medications and need a feeding tube to be inserted in its stomach. Your vet will make this assessment. If your sheep is not drinking, make sure to give them electrolytes. If they have no interest in water, you can give an electrolyte mixture, purchasable at any feed store, through their mouth forcibly. It can be mixed into a syringe that can be squirted into the sheep's mouth, or put in a bottle for lambs. , Parasites can be a common cause of pneumonia. Sometimes bacteria from the parasite can spread into tissues further weakening the animal and an anti-biotic treatment can help alleviate these ancillary problems. They are found using tests but can also be narrowed down using symptoms such as listlessness or diarrhea.


These parasites are overwhelmingly internal and require an injectable anthelmintic medication such as Moxidectin or Ivermectin. The dosing is based on the weight of the animal and can range from 1 oz per 100 pounds or 1ml/10 pounds. "

Look for changes in behavior.,
Take your sheep's temperature.,
Listen for coughing and labored breathing.,
Look for eye or nose problems.",How to Care for a Sheep With Pneumonia2," One of the earliest signs of pneumonia is a general listlessness, disinterest, and an overall dullness. This can particularly be seen in eating and drinking habits. If your sheep shows a general disinterest in eating, you'll want to keep an eye on them.Watch how your sheep interacts with the flock. If they are having trouble keeping up with and interacting with the rest of the flock, they may be coming down with an illness.

, Using a rectal thermometer, insert it into the sheep's rectum in the early morning before it has had time to engage in activity or be in the heat. Any temperature above 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius) signals that your animal is likely ill. If you have never used a rectal thermometer, consult your vet or a friend so that you do not cause any damage to the animal.

, If your sheep is acting different, and has a high temperature, you'll want to look for other common signs of pneumonia like coughing. Sheep dealing with respiratory issues may cough and sound wheezy with labored breathing.


It's normal for an animal to have quickened, labored breathing in hot weather so make sure to take into account the setting and circumstances.

, Sheep with pneumonia may have a whitish discharge coming from their nose and water-filled eyes that appear weeping. Their eyes may also appear dry and sunken in some cases.


In its more developed stages, the sheep may have a frothy discharge coming from their mouth caused by difficulties breathing.

Keep the sheep's environment sanitary.,
Keep barn temperature and humidity controlled.,
Try to keep stress to a minimum.,
Prevent overcrowding in your herd.",How to Care for a Sheep With Pneumonia3," This is particularly the case if your herd has been dealing with ongoing issues with pneumonia. These usually are given four to six weeks apart and then another one annually. However, these can have limited effectiveness and other means can also help prevent the disease from taking root in your flock. , Urine and feces can release gases that harm the respiratory track making pneumonia more likely. Also, a wet bedding can cause the animal to become chilled and more susceptible to pneumonia.

, Sheep are fairly resilient and can tolerate some heat or cold but avoid anything too extreme. If it is a chilly winter night, make sure that your sheep are in a barn that can provide some heat and shelter for them. Also, make sure that their barn is not too humid as this can exasperate and cause respiratory issues. Make sure to keep it properly ventilated. Stagnant air can cause breathing problems.

, Animals that are constantly stressed because of transportation, birthing or heavy milking are more prone to disease. If you know that an animal is going to be susceptible to these sort of circumstances, make sure you monitor your animal carefully. , Sheep that are kept in cramp conditions and overcrowded are much more likely to develop and spread diseases like pneumonia. Make sure that they have adequate room to move around, eat and access to plenty of fresh air. "

Only open social media accounts that you plan to use regularly.If you find that you seldom use a social media account, take steps to deactivate or fully delete the account. You don't want to leave that information out there for people to access.
Older social media accounts can give scammers personal information about you, such as things that happened in your past, that they can use to get close to you. Often a sweetheart scammer will try to convince you that they are safe by saying they know someone from your past, or that they know things about you that you think they wouldn't know unless you had been acquainted at some point.;
, All social media platforms have privacy settings that you can control to limit access to your information. Before you set up a social media account, study these settings carefully and make sure you understand how they work.Many social media platforms, such as Facebook, give you the opportunity to ""test"" your privacy settings by seeing how your page or certain posts will look to a stranger or to certain friends or followers. Make use of this preview function to make sure your privacy settings are correct.
You may need to help children or elderly loved ones adjust their privacy settings so that strangers don't have access to information they shouldn't.

, In the world of online dating this can be difficult, but at least on social media it's important to limit your ""friends list"" only to people who you've actually met in real life.Most social media platforms that have a friends list also have a ""follow"" function, where people you don't know can follow your account and read public posts. Encourage people who you don't know to use that feature.
Kids and elderly people may be more vulnerable to adding someone who seems like a kind stranger. Kids get excited if someone seems interested in them, and elderly people may be lonely and appreciate connecting with someone who seems interesting and caring.
If you are caring for children or for elderly relatives, review their friends lists regularly. Engage them in conversation about names with which you're not familiar, and ask them how they met. They should delete or remove people they don't know, unless someone else they know can vouch for that person.

, Even if you've restricted your friends list solely to people you know and have strict privacy settings, you still should avoid putting any information on your profile that could allow someone to gain more information about you or even steal your identity.Be especially cautious when ""checking in"" to locations, especially if you're on vacation. Sometimes the check-in information can become public, such as if you tag a public place. Additionally, it puts people on notice of your present location.
You should never put information such as your phone number, full birth date, driver's license, or other government identification numbers (such as your Social Security number) on an online profile. Scammers can use this information to uncover other details about your life, which they can use to convince you that they actually know you somehow and they are safe.

, If you want to try online dating, restrict your matches to a relatively small geographic area. Do not match or talk to anyone that lives far enough away that meeting up with them is not an easy option.Keep in mind that scammers may use your location to fake their own. Be diligent about questioning them to determine whether they actually live near you. Talking about local news is a good way to do this. Focus on small, community-based stories or points of interest that aren't all over the internet.
Vague questions or statements about the season also can help you identify a scammer or otherwise dishonest person. For example, you might say ""Weren't the cherry blossoms downtown beautiful this year?"" If the person agrees with you, but there aren't any cherry trees in your town, they're probably not being truthful about their location.

, With online dating, anyone interested in you may not give you their full name right away. However, if you've talked for awhile and made a connection, they should be willing to give you this information.Once you have their full name, type it into your favorite search engine surrounded by quotation marks. Click through the results that follow to learn more about the person. You can also compare the web results and images that come up against anything the person has said to you.

, Looking at someone's social media profiles can be a good way to check into their background and figure out if they're a legitimate person or if they're trying to lure you into a sweetheart scam.See if they have photos of themselves with friends in which they've tagged the other person. See if that other person is listed among their friends.
Check their friends' interactions on their posts. Do these people seem to actually know them, or does their profile read more like a fan page? Consider it a red flag if they don't have any pictures of them with other people on their profile and their friends don't directly interact with them on a personal level.

, Scam artists often try to lure victims by stealing photos from a gorgeous model or celebrity and claiming they are selfies. You can search by image on all major search engines to see if these photos appear elsewhere on the internet.This may be the easiest way to determine if someone is using pictures that aren't really them. Scam artists typically don't go to a lot of effort to find pictures to use, so it isn't that difficult to uncover the fraudulent behavior if you're willing to do a few minutes of legwork.
Simply right-click on the photo to copy it, then paste it into your search bar. Review the results to see if any identical matches come up.

, Especially on dating sites, people typically are looking to meet up and actually date someone in person. If you encounter someone who doesn't want to meet up, or always makes excuses, they may be trying to scam you.Keep in mind that people can be legitimately busy. At the same time, if someone has no time to meet up with a potential date, you might question why they have a profile on a dating site.
You also should be wary of people who aren't willing to meet in a public place, or at a reasonable hour. Out of concern for your own safety, you always should meet an online date for the first time in a public place, preferably when it's still daylight.

, Most dating sites and apps have robust security and privacy features that are designed to protect you from scammers or predators. Be wary of someone who attempts to lure you off the site or app.If you choose to communicate with the person outside the app before you meet with them in person, use a secure texting service that won't reveal your phone number.
Avoid giving someone you haven't met in person your phone number. They can use it to gain information about you that you might not want them to know, and they can use this information to scam you.
Additionally, if the person does turn out to be a scam artist, you typically have the ability to block them on most dating sites and apps. Once blocked, they will never be able to see or contact you again. However, if you give them your phone number, you may have to change your phone number to keep them from contacting you.

, The hallmark of a sweetheart scam is that the person will claim to be in love with you, or foster your emotional attachment, and then request money to help them deal with some hardship or trauma in their life.Sweetheart scammers prey on the generosity and caring nature of people they've seduced or befriended. They will tell you a lengthy and often complicated sob story of something terrible that has happened to them, and request assistance.
You may feel bad refusing to help them, but you can simply say ""I'm sorry, but I don't feel I know you well enough to send you money at this point. I wish you luck in dealing with your financial difficulties and am here to support you emotionally."" If the person gets angry after that, or continues to try to pressure you into sending them money, you can be sure that they're just trying to scam you.
Be especially wary of people who want you to send them money using a wire service or other untraceable money transfer service. If you send them money through one of these services, you typically won't be able to get it back.

, In most cases, your scammer will not be local. However, if you have been scammed or if someone has attempted to scam you, the first place you visit should be your local police station.Even if the local police can do little to go after the scam artist, you may need a copy of the police report to file reports with other law enforcement agencies.
Go in person and bring copies of any communication you've had with the person you believe is trying to scam you. Tell the officer at the information desk that you want to file a police report.
When you are interviewed by an officer to complete a police report, provide detailed information about the scam artist and your communications with that person. Some details may be embarrassing for you to admit, but everything is important to help authorities bring the scammer to justice.
Make sure you get a copy of the written report in case you need it later.

, Every social media or dating platform allows you to report unsavory characters or potential scam artists for a violation of the platform's terms of service. If a violation is found, the person's profile will be removed from the platform.When filling out your report, make sure you provide as many details as possible about your interaction with the person. Even though some of it may be embarrassing, don't leave anything out.
Provide your contact information so the platform can get in touch with you if they need additional information.
In addition to reporting the person, don't forget to block them from your account. Many platforms will ask you if you want to report the person when you block them.

, In most countries, federal law enforcement is tasked with monitoring and prosecuting criminal activity that occurs on the internet. In the United States, these crimes are investigated by the FBI.If you want to file a complaint with federal law enforcement in the United States, visit https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx and follow the prompts. Make sure you have gathered all the information you need to provide on your report before you start.
If you're located outside the United States, your local law enforcement may be able to tell you what you need to do to file a report with national authorities. Otherwise, you can find this information through a quick internet search for ""online crime"" or ""online scam"" with the name of your country.

, If you live in the United States, you can report a sweetheart scam to the FTC. The FTC collects data about online scams, and uses it to identify patterns and issue regulations to help prevent scams.To file an online complaint with the FTC, visit the FTC's Complaint Assistant at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/#&panel1-1.
Click on the ""scams and rip-offs"" category and follow the prompts. Review the information you submit to make sure it is complete and accurate before you submit it.

Many domains start with ""com-"" in an attempt to try to look real; however, web addresses usually don't work that way if they're legitimate. Here are examples of fake websites:

wikihow.com-in.site/reward.html
youtube.com-red.com;
, Is it trying to fool you by being close to a well-known name? If it feels fishy, don't click on it. Search for it online and see if there are any other reports of people being misled by it.

If you did click on it, where did the link lead? Was the website trying to take you to a scam?

, Unless the offer was from a trusted website or trusted company, do not trust the offer. Check back on the URL, most scams use scam URLs.

Be aware that some trusted websites may have untrustworthy advertisements. Going back to domain names, check the URL of the offer and see if it matches the URL of the trusted site. If it's a pop-up that doesn't have a URL, err on the side of caution and don't touch it. You may want to ask the website owner if the advertisement is legitimate.

, Many fake offers have surveys. They say the requirement for the product is completing the survey and giving your personal information. However, never give your personal info to an untrusted source. Most surveys have an eligibility test (Usually whatever you enter, it says you are eligible):

Do you want blah blah blah
Your age range
How often do you shop
Do you like that company

, Look for misspellings of brands and company names. These are usually called knockoffs. If you find any knockoff names, it is obvious scam., Search to see comments about the offer to see what people said. Be careful not to trust comments from the page the offer was on. They may be using fake comments. But search online to see what other people said about that offer., If you're unsure of whether an email is legitimate, check to see if it has a ""tail"". An email with a sender of support@wikihow.com would be legitimate, but if the email address was ""support.wikihow.com@gmail.com"" or anything that isn't known to be from the site, it's a scam. If it's in your spam folder, it's most likely a scam, too., Use a temporary email address for sites that might be spammy. Some email scams spam your junk inbox. To fight spam, use a free temporary email such as:

, Your web browser cannot determine anything about your computer files., Some browsers and ISPs send unsafe website warnings, such as malware site, Deceptive site, broken not private connection, fraudulent site, etc. Those are meaning the site can be risky. They will have a button to go back, and another button to accept the safety risks and enter the site., Most fake computer errors try to say your computer contains errors such as out-of-date drivers or viruses and malware. This is a tactic employed by a few ""rogue security"" malware programs, such as SpySheriff.

Creating additional dialogs, and recreating them after you close the dialog. You may not be able to disable the computer from recreating the dialogs.
A button or hyperlink to install something, often claims to be an antivirus program or a computer cleaner, but is very often malware or a virus.
Error messages from your web browser that you have malware on your computer. As mentioned before, websites can't determine things about your computer files, so your web browser shouldn't be giving you notifications that you have a virus.

, What is the computer error? If the error said anything regarding on computer virus, outdated drivers, etc. those are scams. Most as well have a phone number, telling you to call that phone number for immediate tech help. Some calls may ask for credit card number for purchase of ""PC Protection"", which usually is a rip-off, or sells your personal information filling up your voicemail, email, and phone calls with spam., Some websites may have some sketchy advertisements, and a common one is a JavaScript ransomware. The most common scam claims to be from the FBI, claiming that your browser has been ""locked"" for supposed illegal activity, and demands that you pay a large amount of money through a MoneyPak to ""enable"" your browser again. This is a fraudulent claim; however, trying to close out the window will result in a pop-up window claiming that not paying will result in your information being detained, and won't let you leave the page. To disable this scam, you can try disabling JavaScript temporarily or force-quitting your internet browser. Under no circumstances should you pay the fee - you won't get the money back.

While this scam has not been known to install malware, you may want to run a virus scan afterwards, just to ensure that your computer hasn't been infected by the problematic website.
Some ransomware, such as the infamous CryptoLocker, has been distributed through trojans, with the malware file being disguised as a seemingly innocuous PDF or document file. If you don't remember downloading the file, the best choice is to remove it from your computer without opening it.

, If you are on a website to download a program, make sure it is the official program website and not a tech support site that has a lot of downloads available. Also, you may find ads disguised as the download button. Make sure you are not clicking on an ad before clicking ""Download""., If you see a seal about safe to install, click on the seal to see where it goes. If it goes to a computer safety program website, it usually means the download is safe.

If you do not see a seal, search online to see if it is safe.
Look for comments. Only trust social media based comments. Like if you see Facebook comments, or anything in this relevance, the comments usually can be trusted.

, Some problems with your browser or browsing can likely be malware. If you are currently not using any anti-malware programs, be sure to install a trusted one. They will scan your PC for any malware and remove them. The most popular ones are:

Malwarebytes
McAfee
Norton

Be wary of giving out identifying information on the internet.,
Keep your location private.Do NOT give away your location to anyone you do not know online.,
Do not give out personal contact information online.This refers not only to your phone number and email, but your social media sites or instant-messaging services.,
Think before posting compromising content.,
Be wary of strangers who want to meet.",How to Be Safe and Smart on the Internet1," Giving away personal information on the internet is like giving away your life. When people are on social networks (Facebook, Myspace, etc.), they often don't realize when they're sharing too much information. There are many ways in which oversharing your personal information can endanger you.


If you need to enter your name on an account, use a nickname or a fake name. Alternately, you could use an incomplete form of your name. For instance, if you need to enter your name on a form, enter ""Eric P."" instead of your full name, Eric Pillata.
Maximize your account privacy wherever possible. Many sites and messenger services have varying levels of privacy. For instance, you may have the option to share your name, date of birth, and where you go to school in addition to the content you post. Hide this data from everyone except your immediate friends. Explore your account settings to ensure that this information is kept confidential.
Don't post other unique identifying information like your Social Security Number, date of birth, and other data. These are among the most important pieces of information about you, and with them in hand, hackers could easily steal your identity.
Don't use a picture of you as your profile picture on social networks. Put a picture of something that you love instead. For instance, if you love eating grapes, post a picture of grapes on your social media account or chat messenger service of choice. If some malicious person were to discover your real picture, they might use it to locate and harm you.
If you are a minor, always ask your parents what personal information they want you to share online.
Do not overload a user with information, as that user can be hacked and then you sending messages makes you a sitting duck.;
, This means you should not share your address or even the city you reside in. Even the school you attend should remain a secret when chatting or posting online. With just a few details about your location, an internet predator could pretend to be someone you know. For instance, if you tell someone online you live in a certain town, and they know your age, they might be able to pose as someone you know or as someone who lives nearby in order to get you to share important info.


Be careful when posting photos of where you live. A picture in front of your house or near your mailbox might include a partial or complete address which a predator might use to track you down. Carefully examine all photos before posting them online.

, If you make your contact information known to the general public, you might get threatening or abusive messages, or attract unwelcome attention. Keep your accounts visible only to friends who you specifically selected for access.


If you have a website, keep your domain name registration private. If you list your domain privately, instead of your personal contact info, the contact info of your domain registrar will show up for anyone conducting a domain ownership search., The most obvious example of this would be nude pictures or videos.But you could also end up in trouble by posting images, text, or video which celebrates or admits to drug use, racism, and violence. Even if you send this content in confidence to a boyfriend or girlfriend, there’s no way of knowing what they’ll do with it. If you break up, they might, for instance, post the images anonymously online in revenge.


Even if your social media accounts are private, people might repost your content in a public place where you’d rather it not be seen.
Once something is on the internet, it is virtually impossible to remove it. Be smart and don’t post anything you wouldn’t want your mother (or a potential employer) to see.
If a friend posts something on their social media profile, blog, or website which you do not want online, ask them kindly to remove it. If they do not remove it, attempt to force them to remove it by contacting their parents or guardian, or enlist aid of a third party to negotiate with them.
Be proactive in preventing compromising content from being posted online by telling people who take potentially compromising pictures of you, ""Please do not post that online.""
If you are underage, check with your parents before posting anything online., If you are on a dating site or get a message from someone you don’t know who wants to meet, do not meet them unless you are comfortable doing so. Do not give in to pressure from a stranger on the internet to give out your address or other contact info. Remember, with the anonymity of the internet, anyone can claim anything about themselves.


If you do decide to meet someone from the internet, choose a public place like a restaurant or shopping mall to ensure they are who they claim they are.
If you are underage and want to meet up with a friend you've met online, check with your parent or guardian to ensure they know the situation."

Know your sheep.",How to Shear a Sheep," Shearing is done for two main reasons: to collect sheep's wool for sale, but more importantly to relieve the sheep of heavy wool which may cause them to overheat in summer. In some parts of the world, sheep shearing is even considered a sport!


If the sheep are not sheared, they will become uncomfortable and possibly unhealthy, due to the dirt that can become matted up in their wool. Therefore, even if you do not plan on selling the wool for profit, your sheep will still need to be sheared at least once a year.
Due to its warmth and the ease with which it can be spun into yarn, the wool from certain breeds of sheep is a valuable commodity. These animals are often raised differently and fed a special mineral-rich diet to improve the quality of their wool. A single sheep can produce 8 to 10 pounds of wool.;
, Most sheep only need to be sheared once a year, although some breeds with faster-growing wool will need to be sheared twice. The best time of the year to shear your sheep is in early spring, before the lambing season starts and the hot summer weather sets in.


Shearing ewes before lambing season is a good idea for many reasons. It will help to keep them cleaner while giving birth, and make it easier for the lambs to find their mother's teats for feeding. If the animals are kept in a barn during lambing season, the sheared sheep will also take up less space.
Another reason shearing before lambing season is a good idea is that sheared ewes will often eat more grass in order to produce more body heat. This provides them with the extra nutrition they need before giving birth.
Try to shear the sheep about a month before they give birth to the lambs. This will give them time to get over the stress of shearing. If you own a breed of sheep with fast-growing wool (such as Cotswolds, Icelandics and Lincolns) aim to do the shearing in late summer or early autumn. Sheep will need at least six weeks to grow their wool before the winter weather sets in., Although it may not seem like it, shearing a sheep is very hard work. It requires confidence, skill and strength. Therefore, it might be a good idea to call in a professional shearer to perform (or at least help out with) the shearing.


An inexperienced shearer can cause injury to the sheep or to himself. It can also stress the animal, therefore affecting its health. In addition, an unskillfully sheared sheep can cause damage to the wool, thereby making it less valuable for selling.
In certain areas, professional sheep shearers can be booked out months in advance, so it's a good idea to call well ahead of shearing time. Other options include bringing the sheep from a number of smaller farms to a central location to be sheared. Here a hired shearing crew can shear all the sheep and process the wool simultaneously.
If you're adamant about shearing the sheep yourself, you can learn the proper skills by attending a sheep shearing school. Many sheep-farming states hold annual shearing classes that are open for any shepherds to attend., It's very important to have good quality shearing equipment. This will make the whole process much easier and is safer for both the shearer and the sheep. These days, electric cutters are used almost exclusively.


Electric shears have three main parts - the handpiece, the comb and the cutters. Look for shears with a higher number of teeth on the comb, as these tend to cut closer to the skin. You can expect to pay $250 to $500 for a good quality electric shears.
It's important to ensure that your cutters are still sharp before you begin shearing. Dull cutters will be more difficult to use and could be dangerous for both you and the sheep. Luckily, it is very easy to just replace the cutters on your shears. New cutters will cost between $10 and $15.
In years gone by (and in places with limited access to electricity) shearing was done using hand shears. This method of shearing is much more time-consuming and leaves more wool on the sheep.

, Before shearing, the sheep should be rounded up and gathered into a pen. If possible, separate the sheep into groups, keeping any lambs, yearlings, ewes and rams separate from each other. You could also separate the sheep according to breed or grade.



Don't allow the sheep to get wet. Make sure that the sheep are not exposed to rain before shearing, as wet sheep cannot be sheared. This is because the shearer or the sheep could receive an electric shock (from the shears) and wet wool cannot be rolled up and sold.

Fast the sheep for a day before shearing. Sheep should not be given any food for the day prior to shearing. This will reduce the amount of waste they produce and help to keep the shearing floor clean. It will also minimize their discomfort when rolled on their backs for shearing., The first step in shearing a sheep is to get it in the correct position. There are five main positions you will need to use throughout the shearing process.


The first involves gently tipping the sheep over onto her back, then propping her shoulders between your knees for support. Her belly should be exposed and her four legs should be in the air.
Keep in mind that the more comfortable your sheep is during shearing, the less she will struggle - making your job easier as a result., The wool on the sheep's belly is normally the dirtiest and is not valuable for selling. This is why it is a good place to start.


Using long, confident blows (this is the correct term for shearing strokes), shear the wool from the top of the brisket (breast bone) all the way down to the open flank area.
Make your first blow on the right hand side, your second on the left, then shear off the wool in between. Make sure the first and second belly are set wide enough apart. This will make the rest of your job easier down the line.

, The next step is to the wool from the inside of the hind legs and the crotch. To do this:


Lean further forward (still holding the sheep firmly between the knees) and bring the shears up along the inside of the right leg.
Then bring the shears across to remove the wool along the crotch. This blow may need to be repeated to ensure all the wool is removed. Now run the shears down the inside of the right leg.
The most important thing to be aware of here is the ewe's teats. It's advisable to cover the teats with your left (or non-dominant) hand to prevent yourself from accidentally shaving them off.

, Turn approximately 90 degrees so that your right knee is in front of the brisket and the sheep's right foreleg is in between your legs and her left side is exposed.


First shear the wool from the sheep's left hind leg, starting at the toe and working your way up towards the hind quarters, finishing on the near side of the backbone.
Shift your right leg a few inches backwards to gain better access to the sheep's tail. Position the comb of the shears so it will enter the wool at the top of the tail. Make a blow from the top of the tail upwards along the backbone. Repeat once or twice to clear all the wool from the tail.
Since you have easy access to the sheep's head in this position, you can take this opportunity to shear the topknot of fleece from the sheep's head, if necessary., Before you continue, you will need to move into the third position. To get in position:


Place your right foot in between the sheep's hind legs and your left foot at the base of her spine, holding her body firmly between your knees. Use your left hand to grab the sheep below the chin and stretch her head backwards.
Bring your clippers from the brisket towards the neck, ending your blow just below her chin. This is one of the most satisfying parts of the process, as it feels like you are ""unzipping"" her fleece.
Continue to make long parallel blows along the left side of her neck, ending first beneath her eye and then beneath her ear. Use your left hand to hold her ear back so you don't nick it.

, Shift your weight and maneuver the sheep slightly, so you have better access to her left shoulder.


As the skin on the shoulders can be quite wrinkled, use your left hand to pull the skin taut. This will make your blows a lot smoother and help you to avoid nicking or cutting the sheep.
Starting from her left knee, shear upwards towards her left shoulder, using one or two blows to clear the wool. You should also use this as an opportunity to clear the wool from the inside of her left foreleg.

, Move into the fourth position by sliding the sheep down along your shin until she's lying on her right side. Keep your right foot between her hind legs and your left foot under her shoulder.


Now it's time for the long blows, which extend all the way along the sheep's back. Position the shears at her tail and make a long straight blow all the way to her head, staying parallel to her spine.
Continue making these blows along the back until you've gone one blow past the backbone and her entire left side is cleared of wool.

, Now it's time to move into the fifth and final position. Swing your right leg around so you're standing upright with the sheep's nose between your knees.


Shear along the right side of the sheep's head, neck and shoulders, using three or four separate blows. Remember to use your left hand to hold the wrinkly skin around the shoulder taut.
Once the neck and shoulder are cleared of wool, shear the wool from her right foreleg, from the shoulder to the toe.
Next, make a series of of diagonal blows along the sheep's flank to clear the wool from this side. Use your left hand to put pressure on the sheep's right shoulder joint to keep her steady.

, The last step is to shear the wool from the sheep's right leg and hindquarters.


Shift your right foot forward slightly so you can reach and place your left hand on the sheep's right flank, applying firm pressure. This forces the sheep to keep her leg straight (making it easier to shear) while also stretching the skin.
Shear in a curved motion from the sheep's flank to her right hind leg. When the leg is cleared, make the final few blows to clear the last of the wool from the sheep's hindquarters. Congratulations - you've sheared your first sheep!

, Once the sheep has been sheared, you will need to skirt and roll the fleece (if you plan on selling the wool).


Skirting means removing any dirty or ""incidental"" wool which is not valuable and therefore not used for selling. To skirt the wool, place the fleece flesh-side down on a flat table or other surface. Spread it all out til it forms a single layer.
Remove any dirty or contaminated wool from the outside edges of the fleece - this includes any off-color wool, tags or matted wool. These bits are mostly found on the wool that was on the belly, legs and rear end of the sheep.
Once the contaminated wool has been removed, you can roll the fleece. The best way to do this is to fold the long sides of the fleece towards the center, then roll the fleece from one end to the other, so the flesh side is facing outwards.
This creates a neat package that can be easily transported for sale. Do not tie the rolled fleece, as this can lessen the value of the wool., One of the most important aspects of becoming a good shearer is to be confident with your blows.


Try not to second guess yourself or fumble with the shears, this will only increase your chances of making a mistake.
Try to develop a rhythm as you shear, this will help you to move easily from one section to another., Sometimes when a blow is performed incorrectly, you will need to make a second pass with the shears to remove the remaining wool. The small bits of fleece that result from this second pass are known as second cuts.


Second cuts are undesirable as they cannot be included in the rolled fleece. This is because they make yarn weaker and cause it to pill more easily.The more experience you have, the less likely you are to produce second cuts. Being confident with your blows will help you to avoid them.

, The shears will move more easily and get a closer cut when the sheep's skin is pulled taut.


Therefore it is important to constantly use your left (or non-dominant) hand to stretch the skin you are about to shear.
This is particularly important for sheep with finer wool, as their skin is more wrinkled and harder to see through the excess wool.

, Being familiar with your sheep will make a world of difference when it comes to shearing.


Knowing whether she's fat or skinny will help you to navigate her body shape and move the shears at the right angle over her hips, shoulder and spine.
Knowing how many teats she has (some sheep have two, others have four) will help you to avoid them while shearing, and prevent you from accidentally shaving any off.
Being familiar with the overall health of your sheep is also useful. Healthy sheep produce plenty of lanolin (a wax-like substance produced in the sebaceous glands) which melts and lubricates the clippers on the shears, helping the wool to come away more easily. The lanolin on unhealthy sheep tends to stay thick, clogging up the clippers."

Determine the geographic area from which to purchase your wool.,
Determine the type of business from which to purchase your wool.",How to Buy Sheep Fleece1,"


Consider wool from Australia or New Zealand. Australia is the leader producer of wool in the world, and the country's wool mainly comes from Merino sheep, which have the highest quality wool. The second leading wool producer is New Zealand, which provides crossbred wool from Merino sheep bred with other types of sheep. Australian and New Zealand wool can be purchased online or through woolen mill catalogs.
Consider wool from the United States. The majority of wool in the U.S. comes from Texas, Colorado, California, Wyoming and New Mexico, where most commercial sheep farmers breed Rambouillet (French Merino) sheep. Buy American wool online or through woolen mill catalogs.;
,


Purchase sheep fleece from a woolen mill or warehouse. A woolen mill provides an extensive selection of sheep fleece in large quantities. The wool at woolen mills and warehouses is typically provided through large-scale sheep farmers.
Buy sheep fleece from wool pools or fiber co-ops. A wool pool or fiber cop-op is a group of fleece producers who combine their wool yields for increased sales potential. Often, sheep farmers don't produce enough fleece to sell directly to a warehouse or woolen mill, so they work with other sheep farmers in their region to market their wool. Wool pools and co-ops typically offer a variety of fleece options sorted by type and classification.
Purchase fleece directly from a local farmer. Small farmers raise sheep for specific markets, such as hand spinning, weaving and knitting. For example, a small farmer may produce only long wools, which are commonly preferred by hand spinners.
Buy sheep fleece from a local carding mill. A carding mill is an establishment that cleans and brushes fleece using machines. Carding mill workers may sell you raw fleece or direct you to local sheep farmers.

You should take the lamb to the vet's first before attempting to treat the lamb yourself. The vet will be able to tell you exactly what the lamb needs in terms of care and help you find the proper milk and colostrum replacers to feed your lamb and assure she gets all the vitamins and minerals she needs.;
, Colostrum is the first type of milk a ewe produces after giving birth. It's vital to the health and well-being of a lamb.


Colostrum is important because it contains high levels of nutrients and also protects against a variety of infectious agents. Lambs do not carry antibodies at birth, so they need colostrum to help them develop antibodies and combat potential infections.Lambs should receive 10% of their body weight in colostrum after birth. That means a 10 pound lamb should consume 1 pound of colostrum during the first 24 hours of life. If your lamb has been abandoned or rejected by her mother, get her colostrum replacer as soon as possible. In fact, if you raise lambs, it's a good idea to have colostrum replacer on hand at all times in the event of an emergency.Colostrum replacer should be sold at most places that sell livestock feed and equipment., Your lamb will need milk replacer for roughly the first 13 weeks of life.


Lamb milk replacer can also be purchased at a store that sells livestock feed. Once opened, keep it in a sealed gallon jar. Placing a few bay leaves on top of the jar can prevent insect infestations.Make sure the milk replacer is specifically for lambs. Do not try to substitute milk replacer with products for cows as these have different nutrients and vitamins and will not keep a lamb healthy., If you cannot find milk replacer or colostrum replacer, you can make your own at home. It's recommended you try to find store bought brands first, as they're more likely to have the proper nutrients, so only resort to homemade products as a last resort.


Colostrum replacer can be made by mixing 740 milliliters of cow's milk, one beaten egg, a teaspoon of cod liver oil, and a teaspoon of glucose together. It can also be made with 600 milliliters of cow's milk, a teaspoon of castor oil, and one beaten egg.Milk formula can be made with a teaspoon of butter, a teaspoon of dark corn syrup, a can of evaporated milk, and oral and liquid baby lamb vitamins you can purchase at a feed store., A lamb should be fed with an 8 ounce baby bottle with a rubber nipple.


Initially, you should fill the bottle with 10% of the baby lamb's weight in colostrum and feed this to the lamb within its first 24 hours. Feed the lamb every two hours, if possible, during this timeframe.After the initial colostrum feeding, your lamb will need 140 milliliters of milk replacer. Measure out the proper amount into the bottle and heat the bottle until it's warm to the touch but not scalding, much like you would heat a baby's bottle.Sterilize the bottles and nipples regularly with Milton sterilizing solution or a baby's steam sterilizer.Any milk residue is an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. Do not use bleach because it will ruin the nipples., Once you get past the initial 24 hour period, you should set and follow a feeding schedule for your lamb.


For the first 24 hours after receiving the colostrum, lambs should be fed 140 milliliters every four hours. After this, feed your lamb 200 milliliters four times a day. Your lamb should still be fed about every four hours. Keep track of what times you feed your lamb and make sure to get a feeding in at the proper intervals.Once 2 weeks pass, you can begin gradually upping the amount of milk you feed your lamb.
As previously stated, heat the milk replacer first so it is warm to the touch without being scalding., Once you have the milk measured and prepared, you can feed your lamb.


Lambs should feed standing up. Do not cuddle or hold your lamb while bottle feeding as this could result in a clot in her lung.Most lambs will suckle instinctively. If your lamb is not suckling, pressing the bottle's nipple against her lips should encourage her to feed., After a week of bottle feeding with colostrum and then milk, your lamb should have some solid foods in her diet.


Give the lamb fresh water, hay, and grass. Let her eat and drink as she desires.If she's strong enough, let her out to graze with the rest of the flock so she can begin socializing with other sheep., You should increase the amount of milk your lamb gets as she grows.


After two weeks of feeding her 200 milliliters four times a day, gradually build her up to 500 ml four times a day.
After another two weeks, gradually increase the feeding amount to 700 ml a day four times a week.After 5 or 6 weeks, begin decreasing the amount of milk. Cut back to 500 ml a day only two times a day., By the time your lamb is 13 weeks old, she should be completely free of milk and transitioned into a diet of hay, feed, grass, and water. Make sure you keep track of time and stick on your schedule to gradually decrease feedings starting at 5 to 6 weeks., You need to make sure your lamb is not being over or under fed. There are several ways to make sure a lamb has received an adequate meal.


At the end of a meal, a lamb's sides should be straight from the hips to the rib. This is ideal, as it means your lamb has had an appropriate amount of food.If you notice your lamb's sides are puffed out after feeding, reduce the amount of milk in the next meal as you likely overfed her., Lambs are often bottle fed because they're orphaned or abandoned. If a lamb cannot rely on the body heat of a flock, her body heat might become dangerously low and hypothermia could result. There are measures you can take to prevent hypothermia.


A lamb in the beginning states of hypothermia will appear weak, gaunt, and will probably be hunched over. A rectal thermometer can be used to confirm a low body heat. A normal lamb will have a body heat of 102-103 degrees Fahrenheit. Anything lower than this can be a sign of a problem.Wrap your lamb in a towel to warm her. You can also use a hair dryer to warm a lamb. You can also buy a lamb jacket, a device meant to stay on a lamb's body overnight. Heat lamps are not advised as they can cause fires in a barn.Keep your barn free of drafts, especially in the winter months., Pneumonia is a common problem in lambs, especially those that need to be bottle fed as they do not always get the proper antibodies to fight off bacteria even with colostrum replacers.


Pneumonia is marked by respiratory problems, an increased heart rate, and fever. Lambs suffering from pneumonia might not want to nurse.Drafts and dampness are the primary causes of pneumonia. Keep a clean, dry barn free of drafts to prevent pneumonia in your lambs.If your lamb develops pneumonia, get antibiotics from a veterinarian and administer them as soon as possible."

Don’t listen to their lies.Cyberbullies will often claim that there are a number of other people who agree with them.,
Stay cool.,
Do not reply to or engage with cyberbullies.,
Contact the administrator directly in order to get the individual banned or reprimanded.",How to Be Safe and Smart on the Internet2," They may say that others have contacted them privately about you and your behavior or beliefs in order to bolster their case that there is something wrong with you. This is especially common in long-term online communities like chatrooms or online forums.


For instance, after enduring several weeks of abuse from a cyberbully you might get a private message from them which reads, “A number of users have contacted me about what you’ve said and agree with me that you are both stupid and ugly.”

, Do not let abusive messages hurt your feelings. Remember, the cyberbully is posting or sending abusive content with the express goal of getting a rise out of you. If you feel sad, hurt, or angry, the cyberbully has won. View the situation in a detached light and consider the cyberbully for what he or she is: a pathetic, sad individual who projects their weaknesses and flaws on others.Understand that cyberbullies, like any other kind of bullies, are cowards and use the anonymity afforded by the internet to hide who they are. Recognizing this will help you put their opinions and abuse in perspective. It is difficult to take seriously the worthless claims of a coward.
Don’t blame yourself for the cyberbullying.Don’t, for instance, feel that the abuser might have a point when he or she criticizes a shirt you wore in a picture you posted of yourself. You never deserve slander and abuse online or offline for the clothes you wear (or any other reason).
Engage in hobbies and interests where you cannot be cyberbullied. Try taking a brief break from the web by playing a sport, picking up a musical instrument, or writing your feelings in a journal. Running or biking are also great choices to relieve stress brought on by cyberbullying.

, Cyberbullies thrive on the sense of control they derive from taunting and harassing you. When you see their messages in your inbox, or read them in a forum, do not reply in order to deny their charges, and do not reply with an equally malicious line of slander.Doing so would bring you down to their level.


If possible, block the user on the forum or chat community. This way, they cannot send you messages and you cannot see their posts., Keep all abusive messages and emails. Do not delete them. If possible, create a subfolder for these messages labeled “Abuse” and store them there. The messages will serve as evidence for you later if you need to take more serious action. The accumulated emails or messages will serve as evidence that you have been a victim of cyberbullying.Each time you receive a message or see a threatening or abusive post, report it to the forum administrator.
If your cyberbully is sending messages directly to your email, you may need to contact their internet service provider (ISP) directly in order to have their email account shut down. For instance, if you get emails from bully@aol.com, you can contact AOL (the provider of the email address) in order to get that email address banned.

Turn your computer off when it is not being used.",How to Be Safe and Smart on the Internet3," Your firewall is an option which helps protect your passwords and computer security. You can think of it the same way you think of a lock on your door. If your firewall is down, you open yourself up to hackers who can take or delete information, steal your passwords, and wreak all manner of other havoc. Do not, therefore, switch the firewall off.


Grant access to the firewall only for authorized programs which require it like games or video streaming services.

, A virtual private network (VPN) essentially acts as a middleman between the web and your computer, and provides an extra layer of encryption to your interactions online. The VPN server might be located in a different city or even a different country than the one you reside in, and means that tracing your data back to you is almost impossible.


For a double-whammy of internet privacy, combine the VPN with your browser’s incognito or privacy mode. Privacy mode prevents data, cookies, your download record, and other info from being saved on your computer.

, Spend a minimum amount of time logged on to public wifi.


Be sure what the name of the public wifi hotspot is. Logging into the wrong one, or one with a similar name meant to deliberately deceive public wifi users, could mean your online communication -- including passwords, emails, and bank info -- is being lifted by a hacker.
Keep your home wifi connection encrypted. Open wifi makes it easy for hackers to access your computer and download illegal files.
Purchase a new router every few years. Some routers have vulnerabilities which never get corrected., Use long passwords (greater than eight characters) with a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and (if possible) other characters like underscores and dollar signs.


Make each password unique and write them down in a notebook that you always keep in one place. You’ll remember the most important and most common ones in time; the less common ones will be accessible with your password notebook.
Add passwords to your devices, too. Your computer, phone, and tablet should all be password-protected.
Don't use something obvious as your password like your lover's name, your date of birth, or your name.

, Many services have begun using two layers of security, a process called two-step authentication . For instance, Google offers its Gmail users the option to receive a text message containing a random logon key after entering a password on unknown devices. This way, if someone does gain access to your password, they will be unable to use it except on the devices you have selected as safe.

, If your operating system or internet browser does not incorporate fixes for the latest security glitches, you leave yourself vulnerable to hackers. Set your system and software to automatically update when new updates are available. This will keep your system safe.


Most software will ask you when you first install it whether you want it to auto-update. Indicate that you do to save yourself the hassle of figuring out how to manually update later.

, Hackers and phishers will often send mass emails out to unsuspecting users with worms (malicious data-gathering programs), viruses, or other malware. Users who download email attachments without first scanning them or checking them against known bad files put themselves at risk for a security breach. Do not download attachments in online links, emails, or messages from sources you do not trust.

Decide what form of wool to purchase.,
Determine whether you will purchase ""greasy wool"" or scoured wool.,
Consider whether to purchase fleece from long wool sheep or medium wool sheep.,
Evaluate whether to purchase course or fine sheep fleece.,
Consider what color of sheep fleece to buy.",How to Buy Sheep Fleece2," Wool is typically available as raw fleece, roving or curly locks.


Choose raw fleece for an actual skirted fleece. The wool is in its natural state, cut from the sheep and usually not cleaned.
Choose roving for wool that has been combed, cleaned and twisted to the hold the fibers together. Roving is usually fine and very soft, and is often used for spinning.
Choose curly locks for soft, curly wool. Curly locks are usually cleaned and combed, and are ideal for craft projects like dolls or Santa beards. Curly locks also can be used for spinning and knitting, but the curls may create additional texture in the finished products.

,


Select greasy wool if you intend to wash the wool after receiving it. Wool in its pure form off of the sheep is known as greasy wool because it not cleaned and contains high levels of lanolin. Greasy wool also may contain dirt, vegetable matter, dead skin and sweat residue. You can wash or scour the wool on your own with warm water and a mild detergent. You may need to remove vegetable matter and larger clumps of dirt by hand. Because it has not yet been processed, greasy wool is usually cheaper than scoured wool. However, the greasy wool will shrink after washing, so the quantity you order may not be a true indication of the finished product yield.
Select scoured wool for cleaned fleece. Large commercial wool providers use industrial detergents and alkali to clean the wool. They also may remove vegetable matter through a process of chemical carbonization. Smaller farmers may simply clean the wool by soaking it in a mild detergent and warm water. Scoured wool is more expensive than greasy wool, but the wool is already pre-shrunk.

,


Opt for long wool sheep fleece for the heaviest and longest fibers. Although long sheep fibers are course, their length makes them easier to spin into finer, softer wool. Long wool sheep fleece can be used for almost any apparel.
Consider medium wool sheep fleece for lighter weight fibers. Medium wool sheep are usually raised for meat, not fiber. They produce light weight fleeces that can be used for blankets or socks. Medium wool fibers also are ideal for felting projects.

,


Choose course sheep fibers, called carpet wool, for home decorative applications, such as carpets or tapestries. Do not use course sheep fibers for apparel because the garments will be itchy and uncomfortable to wear.
Select fine wool sheep fleeces for increased project versatility. Fine wool fleece has a small fiber diameter and is ideal for almost any project, including garments.

,


Purchase natural white wool for its ability to absorb dye. White wool is more valuable in the commercial fleece market because it can be dyed any color without the use of chemicals.
Buy dark wool for its natural beauty. Many hand spinners prefer natural wool colors. However, dark wool fibers cannot absorb dye, so the color cannot be changed or altered.

"
"
Consider the wool classification.,
Evaluate the fiber diameter.,
Consider the crimp.,
Evaluate the staple length.,
Consider the yield.,
Ask the sheep farmer or wool provider about the care of the sheep.",How to Buy Sheep Fleece3," Each sheep fleece is classified by a wool classer, who evaluates the fiber diameter, staple strength, staple length, yield and color. Before purchasing a sheep fleece, ask the seller about its classification.

, The fiber diameter, which is sometimes call fineness, is the thickness of the wool fiber measured in microns (one millionth of a meter). The finer the wool, the higher the quality. The fiber diameter should be uniform across a sheep fleece. Merino wool, which is the highest quality wool available, typically has a fiber diameter between 12 and 24 microns. On the other end of the spectrum, carpet wools have a fiber diameter between 35 and 45 microns.

, The natural bend or waviness of a wool fiber is called the crimp. Wool fibers exhibit natural elasticity, and can be bent approximately 30,000 times without breaking. The crimp varies along the diameter of the fiber, and can help predict how fine the wool is. Fine wools typically have more crimp per unit than coarser wools.

, To determine the staple length, measure from the base to the tip along an unstretched fiber. Length adds weight to the fleece; therefore, longer staple lengths are preferred over shorter staple lengths. The ideal staple length is between 2 and 4 inches (5.8 and 10.2 cm) because it is easiest to process or spin into yarn at that length.

, The yield is the amount of wool left after scouring. After it is washed, wool shrinks. The yield typically is posted as a percentage of the original greasy wool weight. The yield can vary from 40 to 70 percent. The bulkier the fleece, the higher the yield.

, Many farmers who raise their sheep specifically for wool take precautions to keep the wool protected. Ask about what efforts are made to prevent contamination of fleeces, whether the sheep are protected with coats, and what type of bedding is provided for the sheep. Inquire about the type of plants in the pastures and how the sheep are fed. The answers to these questions will provide insight as to the care of the sheep and the quality of the fleece.

Put the raw wool into the pan or pot.,
Add 1 - 3 tablespoons of salt to the water.

,
Bring the water to boil.,
Clean and waterproof an area to place the wool.

,
Remove the wool from the boiling water.,
Keep the water boiling until all the water evaporates off.,
Pour the lanolin through a cheesecloth.",How to Extract Lanolin from Sheep's Wool," Raw wool or fleece can be purchased direct from a sheep farm, or, if you have your own sheep, use your own fleece.;
, The pot should be large enough to contain all the wool. It might be easier to do this outdoors over an open fire if you have a large amount of fleece.

, Push the wool into the water gently. Pieces of wool can be placed in mesh laundry bags to prevent them from breaking apart.

,, Keep the wool boiling over a period of several hours. During this time, keep an eye on the boiling water and add more water as it evaporates off. Do not leave unattended as the water could boil off and burn the wool.

,, Do this using a pair of tongs or large slotted spoons.

, The remaining substance is lanolin.

, This will remove any impurities. Pour it into a bowl and leave to cool. Once cooled, scrape off the lanolin and place into sterilized jars. The lanolin is ready to use.

Wear long pants and long socks to protect your skin.,
Approach the sitting camel from the side, slowly and confidently.,
Throw your leg over the middle of the humps and quickly mount it.,
Lean backwards as the camel starts to stand.,
Slowly lean forward as it gets onto its front legs.",How to Ride a Camel1," Camels have an odd, side-to-side gait that causes a lot of friction if you aren't prepared. And the last thing you want is rough, straw-like camel hairs grinding up and down your soft legs. Your socks should come up as high as you can get them since the motion often hikes your pants up uncomfortably. Other clothing essentials include:


A hat and sunglasses to protect your face from the sun.
A long scarf or bandanna to protect your face in case of a dust storm.
Dust goggles, especially if the forecast hints at possible storms.;
, Don't look it in the eyes if you're nervous. Just stride up to it purposefully, coming from a diagonal angle. Unless you're a pro or have help, you're only going to mount the camel if the beast is sitting.


With most guides and groups, the chance of agitating a camel is pretty low. However, there is no reason to take unnecessary risks., Getting on the camel is the hardest part of riding. Do it quickly, using your momentum as a guide. There is usually a stirrup on one side for your foot. Step up on this stirrup and get your other leg over and around.


You want to be straddling the camel to keep your balance as you start riding. Once the camel stands up you can then move your legs to get more comfortable.
There will be a handle on the front of the saddle to help you hold on as you get up.
Some people actually mount by ""leapfrogging"" from behind the camel. Trust your guide's judgement if he/she suggests this — they know their animals best., Camels stand up with their back legs first. If you're not careful, they'll throw you face first into their necks. Hold onto the saddle and lean back to counteract the camel's motion.

, Once it has sure footing with the back legs, it will move to the front. Slowly lean forward as the camel pushes up so that you end up with your back straight."
"
Cross one or both legs up on the saddle.,
Let yourself sway with the camel.,
Do not try and control the animal.,
Relax.,
Wait out any spooked or panicked camels with calm, even words.,
Get comfortable being uncomfortable.,
Dismount when the camel sits back down.",How to Ride a Camel2," While straddling the beast like a horse may seem more natural, camel riders have far more comfort when their legs are up and crossed. This better distributes your weight along the humps, saving your tailbone from unnecessary pain. Wrap one or both legs around the saddle post to look like a pro.


Without your legs clamped to the sides, you can sway with the camel's natural gait much more freely.If you're more comfortable straddling, that's fine! The leg cross is not an absolute must, although it is more comfortable on long rides.

, A camel's walk is odd, irregular, and herky-jerky. It is not like the measured gait of a horse, so you need to ride accordingly. Instead of fighting it, let your body swing back and forth, holding onto the saddle post for support.


There is often another post behind your seat. Holding on to both of them, with a hand in front and a hand behind, puts you in line with the camel's body and makes it easier to work with its movements.
Tie in any valuables and electronics. This movement can easily cause things to shake loose and fall if you're not careful.

, Unfortunately, camels won't listen. Camels will listen to their master, however, and follow the line in front of them. While they may respond to the occasional tug or push, you shouldn't try to steer or direct them — they'll just be unhappy with it., This isn't just for your peace of mind. Loosening your muscles and taking a deep breath will also calm the animal down. Other camels may nip or play with your ride, but if you keep calm and cool, nothing will get out of hand. Panicking, however, may cause the creatures to panic as well. The calmer you are the calmer your ride will be.


Once you get used to the gait, relax your grip a bit. Take a deep breath.
Let yourself move around, but trust that you won't fall off. You'll get used to it quickly enough.

, If the camel gets spooked or starts moving too quickly, stay calm. Keep a firm, but not tugging, grip on the reins and speak calmly until the camel relaxes. If you can, try to use the reins to pull the camera into a circle, so that it rides in small area until it calms., If you've never partnered with a camel before, know that this is not going to be the most pleasant ride of your life. You will have some pain in your tailbone, as it's not used to this sort of movement and pressure. Pop a couple of over-the-counter pain relievers thirty minutes before you go, or have some on hand to manage the pain later., Getting off is much easier than getting off. Use the saddle handles to push yourself up, then swing your leg over the hump to one side. You can simply jump off.

Consider your cash flow. Camels will cost a lot of money. There's not just the cost of buying and transporting the camel, but also food, equipment, and vaccinations. If your camel gets sick, you will also need to find a specialized vet.
If your camel is not properly trained, you may need to spend additional time and money to train it. This will be important when it comes to grooming the camel.;
, Depending on what you will need the camel for, you may need to make some additional preparations. It is best to make these preparations ahead of time. This way, you will have everything ready for your camel, and you won't have to scramble to make any last minute purchases. Here are some things to keep in mind:


If you plan to keep the camel for a pet, you will need a pasture with strong fences and a three-walled shelter.Plan on having at least two acres of land per camel, and to keep them away from horses. Because camels are herd animals, it might be a good idea to keep at least two.If you plan to ride the camel, you will need a saddle, a rope and peg, and blankets. You might also find a camel stick helpful too.If you plan to use the camel to carry stuff for you, you will need additional rope and sturdy sacks., Camels can go for a long time without drinking water, but they need food daily.Before you buy your camel, it might be a good idea to have some food prepared for it. This is especially important if you plan on traveling with your camel to places where it cannot graze.


Camels prefer alfalfa hay and oat hay. You can also feed them corn or oats from time to time.Camels need 5 ounces (140 grams) of salt every day. If the camel's food does not already include salt, consider getting a salt block.Make sure that your camel will get enough selenium. A camel will die if it does not get enough selenium. If the camel's food does not already include selenium, you will need to supplement it., Just like cats and dogs, camels need yearly vaccinations as well. They also need to be trained, not just for riding, but also to handle proper grooming.


Camels need yearly vaccinations, such as West Nile virus vaccine. These can be administered by a specialized vet. If you are not willing to give your camel vaccinations, you would end up with a very sick camelCamels need to be groomed. This will keep their thick fur clean of dust and insects. Regular brushing will allow you catch any bites, bumps, or cuts, and to treat them before they get infected.Camels have nails instead of hooves. They will need those trimmed by a vet or farrier. They will need their toenails trimming either by the vet or a farrier.Camels need to be trained to stand still while having their fur brushed and their nails trimmed. They will need additional training if you plan on riding your camel.

, Depending on where you live, you might need special clearances, authorizations, and paperwork in order to own a camel. For example, if you live in the United Kingdom, for example, get a DWA license. You need this license to legally keep a camel in the UK., Depending on where you live, this can be not only expensive for you, but stressful for the camel. In general, ground-based transportation will be less expensive and less stressful than overseas transportation. If you are using an agency to transport your camel overseas, be sure to ask if they offer any aftercare. Some agencies just drop the camel off at a predetermined location, and how you get your camel home from there is up to you.

, This will not only affect the number of humps a camel has, but also its size and fur. For example, the Dromedary has one hump. It tends to be taller, and a natural desert dweller. The Bactrian has two humps and a stocky build. It gets a thick woolly coat in winter, making it ideal for colder climates., This is especially important if the camel has to carry supplies, a people, or both. A weak camel can get hurt easily, especially if it is not accustomed to bearing so much weight. Here are some things to consider:Observe the camel's knees when it sits and stands back up again. Look for any signs of shaking or trembling. This is an indicator or weak knees. A camel with weak knees will not be able to safely bear heavy loads.
Watch how it walks. If the camel has a limp, this could be a sign of weakness or illness. This could spell problems later on in your journey.

, Camels are large, strong creatures. A disobedient camel will be difficult to control by strength alone. You also don't want a camel that bites or kicks.


A well-trained camel is important not just for riding, but also for grooming purposes. The camel must be able to stand still while being brushed and having its nails trimmed., The movement should be smooth and fluid. This is especially important if you plan on riding a camel. Unlike with horses, the camel must be seated in order for you to get on and off. You can't mount a camel if it is standing. If the camel sits or stands too roughly, you'll be more likely to fall off.

, Camels do not wear bridles and bits like horses do. Instead, the reins are attached to their muzzles through a peg in their nose. If the camel gets fussy while wearing a nose peg, it might not be trained for riding.

, An unhealthy camel will only create problems, whether you are going to ride it or keep it as a pet. Check the camel's skin and mouth for any sores. Also, if you can, take a look under its feet. There should be no sores or open wounds. Any of these are indicators of serious medical conditions, which can be disastrous, especially if you are traveling in the desert.


Even if you aren't planning on ever riding your camel, you want to get a healthy one. An unhealthy camel will require veterinary care, which can cost a lot.

, These camels tend to be experienced enough while being strong and healthy., You do not necessarily have to travel to the Middle East in order to buy a camel. For example, if you live in the United States, you might be able to find a camel breeder in your state.


Ethiopia, India, the Gobi desert, and Australia all sell camels. Livestock markets are a great place to start looking.
In India, the city of Pushkar has a huge camel festival in October and November.
Some organizations will allow you to view and/or select your camel online before you physically travel to the location.

, Sellers may recognize your foreignness and flock to you. Some may be honest and helpful, while others might be less so. The dishonest ones may try to use your foreignness against you and over-charge you.If you are visiting a foreign country to buy your camel, it might also be a good idea to familiarize yourself with that country's culture customs, especially when it comes to business, bartering, and haggling. This will prevent you from appearing rude or disrespectful.

, This can be a friend or someone you trust. Try to find someone who knows something about camels. This person can help manage the bartering for you, and ensure that you get a fair price.Offer to pay the person who is helping you for their time, travel, and effort.

, Camels will be cheaper during times when they are plentiful, and more expensive when they are scarce. Other factors that might influence the price of a camel may also include any of the following:


Its age and sex
Whether is it used for meat, milk, or fur
Whether it is used for riding or travel
How well it is trained
Its parentage, especially if it comes from a breeder.

, Choose a name that best matches your camel. Decide based on your fancy, the way they eat or walk, or even just the way they look.

Expect the clothing to get dirty and perhaps a bit smelly.",How to Dress to Get on a Camel," The average pack camel can carry about 400 pounds over 25 miles (181 kg over 40 km) in a day.So it won't be bothered about how many clothes you've got on. You, on the other hand, might be, so don't overdo it, especially when it's hot.;
, Walking, hiking or climbing clothes are a good choice, as clambering up on a camel and staying on it requires flexibility. Choose baggy clothing as this helps with flexibility. The basic rule is: if you can sit in the clothing on the ground, you can sit in it on a camel.


Prefer long pants, slacks or jeans. Camels have fleas, they can spit, and camel hair can be scratchy against a bare leg. By covering up, you will also protect your legs from the sunshine and the potential for getting saddle sores, caused by friction., Layering will let you remove layers if you get too hot, and put them back on if you're feeling chilled.

, You're up higher, so you will get some wind reaction. Roll it up and place it in a pocket, or tie it around your waist.

, Keep the sun off your face as you amble along on your camel. A hat with a tie-on is the best choice.


Consider wearing a Legionnaire's style sun hat, with the long piece covering your neck as well.

,, Bare feet are not recommended around an animal as large as a camel. It could step on your feet and cause a lot of harm. In addition, avoid wearing any shoes that are not strapped or tied on. Camels can jolt, and you don't want shoe loss holding back your enjoyment.


Wear hiking or walking shoes, covered sandals, sneakers, etc.

, While a saddle might protect you from some odor transfer, expect some grime to mark your clothing, as is normal for any outdoor activity.

Learn what female deer look like.,
Study what baby deer look like.,
Examine the neck width.,
Look at the deer's legs.,
Study the deer's body.",How to Age a Deer1," A doe is a female deer and is commonly confused with young male deer, or fawns. Female deer do not have antlers and neither do fawns. Typically, the top of a fawns head will be much flatter than a doe's head. Female deer will have longer, more muscular necks than young male deer., Fawns, or baby deer, have small, square bodies, square heads, and large ears. Their bodies and legs are thin and haven't built any significant muscle definition. Sometimes fawns will not have any antlers, so they are easy to confuse with does., Young bucks will have much thinner necks than adult bucks. Once the deer reaches 3 to 3.5 years old, the neck will begin to start to look more muscular. By 4.5 years old, the buck will have a muscular, proportionally sized neck.During breeding season or the rut, a buck's neck will become swollen and large.

, Young deer's legs look much thinner and longer in comparison to its body. Up until three years old, the legs will maintain this thin and long appearance. When the deer reaches 4 1/2 years in maturity, the legs will often look much shorter and stockier in comparison to younger deer.You should also look for dark tarsal glands. These can be found at the joint on the deer's leg and are darker the older the deer is.

, Young deer will have much smaller stomachs and torsos than fully grown deer. Examine the deer's stomach. If it looks stocky or bulky, there's a good chance that the deer is fully matured. Another area to look at is between the neck and chest. As the buck ages, this area will also become larger."

Look at the length of its antlers.,
Examine the antler spread.,
Understand the deer in your area.",How to Age a Deer2," Get a side view of the deer and take a look at how long the antlers extend in front of its face. An older buck's antlers will stick out about as far as the deer's nose. Adult deer's antlers will typically jut out 20 inches (50.8 cm) or more in front of their face. If the antlers do not protrude far in front of the deer's face, there's a good chance that it's a younger buck.It may be hard for novice hunters to determine an age of a buck by its antlers because they grow at different rates depending on the health of the habitat.

, Look at the buck straight on and try to estimate the distance in between both of his antlers. Antlers will almost never be larger than 14 inches (35.56 cm) apart for bucks who are younger than 2.5 years old. Once the buck is 3.5 years old or older, the antler diameter will typically grow to over 15 inches (38.1 cm)., The size of deer antlers will often heavily depend on the healthiness of the habitat for the deer. Get to understand the deer's habitat and the average size for antlers of adult and young bucks. Talk to your local hunting association or park rangers to better understand the deer in your area.In places like South Texas a buck's antlers can grow to 110-150 inches (279.4-381 cm) long.
In Wisconsin a buck's antlers can grow to be over 200 inches (508 cm) long.

Count the number of teeth in the jaw.,
Look at the third tooth in the deer's mouth.,
Examine the coloring on the third tooth.,
Look at the enamel on the teeth.",How to Age a Deer3," A deer that has five or fewer teeth in its mouth is a fawn. Typically a deer will have four teeth if it's 5 to 6 months old and five teeth if it's 7 months old to one-year-old. Once the deer is over a year old, it will develop its sixth tooth., If the deer is under a year old, its third tooth will be a tricuspid, or have three cusps that form a single tooth. This tricuspid will look worn down until it falls out to be replaced by a permanent bicuspid, or a tooth that has two ridges., If the third tooth is bicuspid, it could still be a younger deer. If the coloring is lighter on its third tooth, or the tooth is just starting to develop, the deer is a little older than one year old. If the third tooth is the same color as the rest of the teeth, the deer could be anywhere between 2.5 years old to a fully matured deer., As a deer starts to age, the enamel on its teeth will start to wear away and the teeth will start to brown. Fully matured deer will have most of the enamel on their teeth worn away at this point. If the teeth look worn down, there's a good possibility the deer is over five years old."

Feed them as much Bermuda hay as they can eat.,

Train them with a halter from a young age, leading them on walks.,
Keep your camel company, as they are very social animals and need companionship.",How to Care for a Camel," Oats and grains are far too rich for a camel's diet, as camels are used to nutrient-poor desert scrubs. Alfalfa, which they love, is also much too rich, but can be used as a treat in small bunches.


In place of Bermuda hay, you can use any other grass-like, dry hay for food. However, Bermuda is your best bet.
Feeding camels costs about as much as it costs to feed a horse. Expect to drop about $250 a month feeding an adult camel.If the camel has grass and shrubs in their field, this is a supplement to their diet. It can not replace regular feeding.;
, Sodium is incredibly important in a camel diet. Camels should have constant access to a salt lick, which you can buy at any store that sells horse supplies. You can also get chunks of salt that they can chew, or hanging ""salt treats."" In general, these smaller chunks are easier for a camel to lick than a large block.No matter your style, make sure your camel can access this crucial nutrient source.

, Camels may not drink if the water isn't clean. Run the hose into their bowls each day so that they get fresh water and nothing is stagnant. While camels have a reputation for needing only a little water, this is only for trained camels accustomed to desert life. The more water you can get them, the better., These can be easily given to them with a treat, such as a handful of alfalfa pellets, carrots, or apples. A standard horse multi-vitamin, with vitamin B, potassium, etc. — will generally do. You also want a selenium supplement, and plenty of vitamin E. Talk to your veterinarian, however, about the exact amounts for your camel.


If you have powdered supplements, try wetting the treats with water or apple cider vinegar. This helps the powdered supplements stick to the treats.
Some camel-specific salt blocks have selenium in them as well. These two nutrients are perhaps the most vital for your camel's health., A tiny stall is not going to cut it for a camel. It must be big enough for the camel to move, eat, sleep, lie down, and be happy. It should be big enough that they can turn around completely with ease and are sheltered from the rain and weather.


If you offer them a large enough area (generally one or more acres) to explore, you can get away with a smaller hut. In these cases, huts would only be a place to get shelter from bad weather., Camels are big and need some room to live. A yard with some grass is highly advised, although is not a must. The more room you can create for your animal, the better. In general, at least a half-acre should be enough. But if you have multiple camels, you'll need more room so they don't get into trouble with each other.


Camels are notoriously tough on fences. An electrified wire is usually your best bet to contain them., Camels are quite clean animals and hate to be in a mess. Clean up their dung in their hut and/or yard weekly, and make sure to do full cleanings regularly. Comb and brush out your camels' fur, and keep their living spaces clean as best you can., This shouldn't be too frequent, but camels' nails can get long and land uncomfortably when they walk. On hard, rocky ground this shouldn't be a problem — the ground will naturally file their nails. But if you have them on softer soil, keep an eye out for any nails that seem to drag along the ground or catch underneath them.


If you're on soft soil, you'll need to train your camel to raise its feet to check and file them. A large metal file will suffice to grind their nails down.

, Shoot for at least one consultation per year, or whenever an issue arises. Camels need a variety of shots and protections to stay healthy, including:


Deworming
Vaccinations for the clostridial diseases and tetanus
Periodic checking and floating of teeth.
If showing or traveling with your camel, check to see your required shots, vaccinations, and certifications., Camel illnesses can be difficult to diagnose, but there are several symptoms that require immediate assistance from a vet:


Soft and/or squishy hump.
Refusal to eat.
Temperature (checked rectally) less than 99 degrees or over 103 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 2-3 days in a row.
Worms or parasites in feces., Camels are massive, dangerous animals if not handled properly. Make sure that you are firm and in control, but don't try and rile up the animal or hurt them when they misbehave. Positive reinforcement (a treat for good behavior) is always your best bet. Camels are smart, social, and affectionate animals. Treat them as such and they will become dream pets.

, This will train them to roughhouse with you all the time. It may be fun when they're young and cute, but it can get dangerous once they weigh a ton and are over seven feet tall.If they panic or get spooked, stay calm and confident. Speak gently and keep your hands on the reins. They will follow your lead.

, They should generally follow your lead. Start this behavior early so they get used to you as the ""alpha camel."" Push firmly along their neck and back, and they should move away from you.

, Reward good behavior with treats — a slice of apple, a carrot, a bunch of alfalfa — as these intelligent beasts respond well to positive reinforcement. The younger you start, the easier this will be. You want them trained before they are too massive to push around. When they do something you like, pet them and give them a bit of a treat. If they don't follow instructions, just be neutral until they get it right. You don't want to spook it and get angry.


Get them comfortable in the harness when they are young. They may resist it at first, but they will quickly grow accustomed when they realize it won't hurt them.

, A halter, similar to the ones worn by horses, is a good idea to help you control and train your camel. They can be purchased at specialty shops. Use it to walk your camel from a young age, getting it used to follow you and stopping on your command. To teach them to stop, pick your word (like ""stop"") and then use your body to physically stop them while you say it. Give them a treat when they comply. Other essential skills include:


Lifting feet so that you can check them.
Sitting down.
Coming to you when called.

, Camels are herd animals. They like company and will often times feel lonely if they are all alone. Consider buying another camel, but only if you can easily handle the responsibility. Camels generally do well with dogs and sheep as well, and will bond with most people. They are very affectionate animals, and even constant visits from you will do them good."

Research different kinds of fish and decide which ones interest you.,
Be careful to undo any myths you might have learned with respect to keeping fish.,

",How to Take Care of Your Fish," Be sure to find out what they need to live, such as tank size, food, and compatible species. If you don't know these basics, you're not yet ready to own fish.;
, For example, common mistakes include putting goldfish and bettas in bowls, adding fish before cycling your tank, and placing incompatible fish together.

, This includes the food, the tank, the filter, substrate, lighting, a heater, and a test kit to measure ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH. You also need water conditioner to remove the chlorine and chloramine in tap water. Spend some time reading the instructions accompanying all of the products you've purchased, as this is a really good way of quickly improving your knowledge and helps you to understand how to set everything up and proper care for that product.

, Fill up the chosen container with water. Then, turn on all equipment and check that it's all working. It is better to find out the things that don't work and fix them before adding the fish.

,, These can have the benefit of offering shelter, filtering the water, and even serving as food. However, be sure to match the types of plants to the fish you're going to keep.

, Fish appreciate things to do and places to chill, just like all living beings. Give them things to hide under, rest on, swim through, look at and even be challenged by. This can include beautifully colored gravel, interesting water tank decorations, large pebbles/rocks, and water cascades.

, It is always best to add only one to three fish at a time. Float the bag in the water for 10 or more minutes so the fish can adjust to the water temperature. Then, add some of your water in the tank into the bag and float it again for 10 or more minutes. If necessary, do it again. Then, gently net the fish out and place it into the tank. This will prevent the transfer of diseases and waste from the pet store.

,, Be sure to vacuum the gravel. Don't replace the filter media if it looks dirty, just rinse it gently in used tank water so you won't kill off the beneficial bacteria that live in the filter.

, The plant life should support the fish, not take over the tank. You will need to cull overgrowth when it occurs and remove diseased or dead plants. You will also need to pay attention to getting rid of algal growth, even if you have fish that feed off it.

"
Decide whether you want Tropical or Coldwater fish.,
Decide what kind and how many fish you want.,
Get an appropriately sized tank.,
Make sure you have all the proper equipment- filters, heaters (for tropical fish), water conditioner, test kit, etc.

,
Set up the tank and cycle it.

,
Put your fish in.,
Perform partial water changes weekly.,
Test the water regularly.,
Feed your fish two or three times a day.

,
Monitor your fish.,
Try not to stress out your fish.",How to Take Care of Your Fish (Tanks)," Coldwater fish include goldfish and minnows. There are many types of tropical fish, from angelfish to corydoras catfish. Coldwater fish are usually a little more hardy, and will survive those first few mistakes, but they need more room.


Start off with inexpensive fish, even if you can afford expensive ones. Inexpensive ones are inexpensive because they are very successful in their natural environments or so comfortable in captivity that they even breed regularly and, in either case, do not die easily on their way to and in pet stores.
Do not start out with saltwater fish. They require techniques and understanding that are much more complex. Plus, the water you'll have to work with and that may leak is messy, slowly corrosive to metal, and conductive. If you believe you want a saltwater tank, get a medium sized tropical fish tank with some plants and see if you can keep that in perfect order first for a year or so.;
,


Research before putting species together. Some fish are compatible, others aren't. One might speculate that fish would enjoy some activity in their lives, so don't get just one. (The fish need not be the same species; for some territorial fish, it is best that it isn't. An armored catfish can be a good ""companion"" for such a beast.)
Make sure you can provide any specialized care the fish need. For example, different fish need different foods, and some fish require more frequent maintenance than others. Owning fish is a big responsibility.
Some fish are perfectly happy with flakes and can be fed with an automatic feeder, which makes it possible to leave the tank unattended for a week or two (assuming the fish are small so the water doesn't need very frequent changing).

, Look up the minimum tank size for each fish.


For goldfish, buy a tank with 20 gallons (75.7 L) for the first goldfish, and 10 gallons (37.9 L) for each additional goldfish.
For freshwater fish, forget about one gallon per inch of adult fish. would you keep a 50 inch (127.0 cm) fish in a 50 gallon (189.3 L) tank?
Bigger is better. Even if the fish looks small, it will thrive in a bigger tank.

,,, Only add a few fish to start with, and slowly build up the population. Adding too many fish at once can overload your filtration system.

, 20-30% is a good amount. To do a water change, get a gravel vacuum and siphon out any waste in the substrate. This will pull out water at the same time. Replace the water with water from your tap, but remember to treat it with a water conditioner.

, Make sure you have 0 ammonia, 0 nitrite, and under 40 nitrate.

,, While they eat, sit and observe them. Check for anything strange: changing color, falling off fins, damaged tails, etc. Also, make sure all your fish are getting along.

, This includes putting your hand in the tank when you don't need to, touching them, or jumping near the tank. Try not to make too much unnecessary noise.

Put your finger on the outside of your aquarium tank near your fish.,
Get your fish to follow your finger.,
Use repetition and rewards to train your fish quickly.",How to Train Your Fish to Do Tricks1," Your goal is to get your fish's attention, and once you get its attention, reward it with food. If your fish responds to your finger right away, award it with food. If your fish does not respond right away, shake your finger and tap the glass until it does notice.You can consider placing your finger in the fish tank for your fish to follow as well. Some types of fish tend to bite, including Bettas, so do some research on your breed fish before putting your finger in their tank.;
, Move your finger back and forth across the tank, and reward your fish every time time it follows your finger. Getting your fish to come to your finger is the first step, but getting your fish to follow your finger as it moves may be a bit more difficult. Move your finger up and down, from side to side, etc. Do not reward your fish until it follows your finger.

, The fastest and most effective way to train your fish is by using food to reward its behavior. With repetition, your fish will learn to associate following your finger with being fed. Once your fish understands that they will be fed for doing what you instruct them to do, you'll be able to teach them a variety of other tricks.If you have pellets, use them for your training instead of regular fish food. If you use pellets for training rather than normal feeding, your fish will view them as a special treat.

Determine what kind of fish you want.,
Buy a tank.,
Select the appropriate gravel.,
Choose a high-quality filter.,
Pick your decorations.",How to Set up a Coldwater Aquarium1," Goldfish, Rosy Barbs, and Guppies are excellent starter fishes. Before you buy your tank and other supplies, determine what kinds of fish and how many fish you will have in the tank. This way, you can buy an appropriate sized tank and the appropriate gravel or substrate., It is recommended that you buy a large tank instead of a small tank. Larger tanks are easier to clean, and you can add more fish to larger tanks. Avoid common myths that tell you it is acceptable to keep fish in bowls. Larger tanks also allow your fish to grow while still being comfortable. Keeping fish in an overcrowded tank is the fastest way to reduce water quality and introduce toxins and diseases to the water.It is recommended that you start with a fish tank that can hold between 20 and 55 gallons. For smaller fish, use a tank that can hold around 10 gallons.
It is also better to buy a wide tank instead of a tall tank. Wide tanks have more surface area, and thus, allow more oxygen to enter the water and more waste gasses to escape.

, Gravel, or substrate, comes in various sizes, colors, and forms. You can choose from gravel, sand, or crushed coral. Gravel is the most common form of substrate and comes in small to large sizes. It is recommended that you buy gravel that is medium in size.Do not buy gravel with sharp edges. The sharp edges can harm the fish's scales. Fish that like to pick up the gravel or dig into the gravel are especially at risk.
Sand substrate is great for fish with delicate barbells, such as the Corydoras catfish. However, it is very difficult to clean and can get stuck in your filter. If you have a picky eater, like a puffer fish, it might swallow the substrate.
Crushed coral gravel is great for fish that prefer a higher pH, such as African cichlids, as this reflects on their natural habitat.

, There are three different types of filtration systems: external, internal, and under gravel. However, whichever you choose, make sure it is high-quality. Internal filters are great for small tanks.Under gravel filters move the water through the gravel, which induces biological filtration to occur. They pull water in and they release it out of the spout.
Examples of high-quality filters are the Fluval External filter, Penn Plax Cascade canister, and the EHEIM Classic External canister.

, There are a variety of decorations you can choose from. There are aquarium backdrops, rocks, driftwood, plants (both real and fake), and furniture or decoration caves, tunnels, and bridges. Make sure to purchase a variety of decorations. A starter kit tank though comes with a rather childish decor, as it is marketed toward children.Plants and furniture allow your fish to hide out, feel safe, and relieve stress. However, for more greedy, herbivorous fish, make sure to get more sturdy, nip-proof plants.
Aquarium backdrops are great for hiding cables and equipment behind the tank. They also create an illusion of depth for the fish.
Make sure the decorations you buy are safe and non-toxic sharp objects are harmful to fish, especially to the Eye goldfish and the Black Moor fish.

Obtain a hoop for your fish to swim through.,
Stick the ring in the water.,
Make your fish follow your finger through the hoop.,
Reward your fish with a treat every time it swims through the hoop.",How to Train Your Fish to Do Tricks2," You'll need a hoop that is big enough for your fish to easily swim through. For smaller fish, using a larger hoop earring or bracelet could work as a hoop. If you want a larger hoop, you can typically make one out of pipe cleaner.


Make sure to wash the hoop so that it doesn't bring any harmful bacteria or substances into your fish tank.
Attach your hoop to a strong or pole if you're uncomfortable putting your hand in your fish tank.
Start with a larger hoop to make it easier for your fish to swim through.

, Your hoop should be perpendicular to the side of the aquarium and near the glass, as this will make it easier for you to direct your fish to swim through it. Your fish may be interested in the hoop right away, or it will simply ignore the hoop.

, Teaching your fish to follow your finger will come in handy for this trick. Simply move your finger across the glass of the fish tank so that your fish follows it. Run your finger along the glass where the hoop is, and your fish should swim right through it. This may take a couple tries, but your fish should start to catch on.

, This will help teach your fish that swimming through hoops will result in being fed. Practice this trick with your fish daily so that it becomes a regular trick.


Once your fish has mastered swimming through large hoops, decrease the size of the hoop to make the trick more challenging.
Begin adding additional hoops for your fish to swim through for a more impressive trick.For more detailed instructions and tips on how how to teach your fish to swim through hoops, check out Teach Your Betta Fish to Swim Through a Hoop.

Decorate your fish tank like an obstacle course.,
Lead your fish around the course with your finger or a treat.,
Reward your fish with a treat after it completes the obstacle course.",How to Train Your Fish to Do Tricks3," Use hoops, arches, plants, etc. to make your fish tank into an obstacle course. Once you've taught your fish how to swim through hoops, they should be able to swim through and around anything with some guidance. Be patient when teaching your fish how to swim through an obstacle course, as it may take some time.

, Your fish will most likely follow your finger around once it has mastered that trick, so lead your fish through its obstacle course. Start with simple obstacle courses, and make them harder once your fish starts to master the obstacles.


Use a treat on a string or a hood to lead your fish around instead of your finger. If you want your fish to follow you all around the tank, it may be hard for you to use your finger. Stick a treat on a hook, stick, or string and move it around the course so that the fish follows it. Make sure the fish doesn't get the treat until it's finished the course.

, Just like all the other tricks, positive reinforcement will help train your fish quickly. Give them a treat every time they complete the obstacle course. If you've had the treat on a hook, make sure to remove it from the hook before feeding it to the fish.

Feed your fish by hand every day.,
Train your fish to swim to the surface for feeding.,
Hold your fish's food just above the water.,
Reward your fish with some treats once they jump out of the water.",How to Train Your Fish to Do Tricks4," This will teach your fish that seeing your hand means that they will be getting fed. Make this a normal routine so that your fish becomes familiar with your hand, and knows what to expect when it comes time for feeding. This will also help your fish begin to develop trust with you.

, Start by getting your fish's attention by placing your fingertips in the water. This should get them to swim to the surface. If this does not get their attention, hold some food in your fingertips as you place them in the water. Do not release the food into the water, as you should not feed them until they have performed the trick.

, After you've gotten their attention, dangle some of their food just above the water. If your fish does not jump for the food right away, you'll need to encourage them. Place your fingertips full of food on the surface of the water, and pull them from the water as your fish approaches. This should encourage your fish to jump from the water to eat their food., This positive reinforcement will show them that jumping from the water will get them an extra treat, as opposed to just their regular food.

Clean the tank once a week.,
Place your tank on a sturdy surface.,
Add the gravel.,
Arrange the decorations.,
Install the filtering system.,
Fill the tank.,
Let the filter run.",How to Set up a Coldwater Aquarium2," The tank and other materials (gravel and decorations) that will be placed in the tank need to be cleaned with warm tap water. Do not use soap or detergent to clean the tank and other materials. The residue left by soap or detergent is toxic to fish., One gallon of water weighs 10 pounds, and the average tank size is 30 gallons. Therefore, the object that you'll place your tank on needs to be very sturdy. Place your tank on a sturdy wooden cabinet or table, as the tank might fall down, which would kill the fish and make a mess on your carpet.If you do not have a sturdy cabinet or table, use a cabinet or stand that is designed for holding fish tanks, especially big ones.
Make sure to place your tank in a cool area, away from heat and out of direct sunlight to avoid overheating the tank, because overheating might boil the water, and this will burn the fish to death.

, Before placing the gravel, also known as substrate, into the tank, clean it first. Run tap water through the gravel about five times until the water runs clear. Place the gravel on the bottom of the tank until it is about two to three inches high. Spread the gravel evenly in the tank., If you bought an aquarium wallpaper or backdrop, attach it to the back of your tank first. Then, begin arranging your decorations as you like. Put the larger decorations near the back of the tank and smaller ones near the front of the tank., Most filters require assemblage before placing them into the tank. Assemble your filter according to the manual provided by the manufacturer. For most filters, you just need to assemble a few parts. Do not turn the filter on until the tank is filled with water.For gravel filters, you will need to place the filter underneath the gravel. Make sure it is stable under the gravel. Attach the pump airlines and power head to the appropriate lift tubes before turning the filter on.
For an internal and external filter, mount it onto one of the tank’s walls, preferably onto the wall that is closest to an outlet. These filters have an external power cable that connects to the main power for filtration to begin. Make sure the power cable will not come into contact with the tank’s water.

, Begin filling the tank with cold water. Slowly add the water to the tank with a pitcher or a hose so as not to disrupt or displace the gravel. Most tanks have a water line indicating where you should fill it to. Once the tank is filled, add the water conditioner or de-chlorinator and stress coat to the water per the instruction manual.The water conditioner and stress coat make tap water safe for your fish to live in.
Place a bowl on the gravel when filling the tank with water to prevent the gravel from moving and dispersing.

, Once everything is set up, turn on the filter. Let the filter run for at least a week before placing your fish in the water. Letting your tank run or cycle allows beneficial bacteria to build up. These bacteria help keep the tank’s water stable for the fish to live in.The longer you let the tank filter the safer the water will be for the fish.
Add the sturdiest and strongest fish first, like the starter fish, before adding in more fish.

Purchase the cleaning materials.,
Vacuum the tank.,
Change the water.",How to Set up a Coldwater Aquarium3," In order to the clean the tank you will need a net to safely remove the fish, a vacuum or siphon to remove the debris, and a five gallon bucket to change the water.You do not need to remove the fish from the water each time you clean the tank. It is best if you can try to keep the fish inside the water while you clean it. If you need to remove the fish, then use the net to transfer them to a large container. Make sure the water is de-chlorinated before placing the fish in the temporary container.

, You will need to vacuum or siphon feces and debris from the tank at least once a week. Use a siphon to remove the debris. If you have gravel in your tank, run the vacuum over the top of the gravel. If you have sand, hold the vacuum slightly above the sand to avoid dispersing and/or sucking up the sand., You will also need to change the water once a week. Use a five-gallon pitcher to remove and replace the water. Replace a third of the water with fresh water each week.If algae is growing on the tank’s walls, then clean and remove this, as well. Use a clean rag to remove the algae. If the fish is attempting to get past your hand and nip the rag you can use an algae scrubber, which you can buy online or at your local pet store (Or Fish Market.)

More fish will mean you need more space in your aquarium. Five gallons (19 liters) is functional for one or small fish, different fish species will have different needs.
You can use a stock calculator to figure out roughly how many fish an aquarium will hold when set up for different configurations, such as salt or freshwater.There is no rule of thumb regarding how many fish will fit in a tank. Types of fish, size of the fish, and how you will plant your aquarium will all impact how many fish you can keep. However, a single fish should have at least five gallons, and in larger tanks you want a minimum of a gallon per fish, often more.;
, Once you know what kinds of fish you are looking to keep and in what quantities, you can decide on how big a tank you need. There is no set rule for tank size, so look into all of the fish types you plan on keeping to see how much space they require.Online species guides can be incredibly helpful for figuring out how much space your fish will need per individual.
Remember that, in general, coldwater and freshwater fish will need more room than tropical, saltwater fish.
When in doubt, opt for a bigger tank. You are much more likely to cause harm to your fish by putting them into too small of a tank.

, Aquarium tanks are typically either acrylic or glass. Decide which material is right for you based upon what type of setup you want and the conditions in the area where you will keep the tank.Glass tends to scratch less and can better support the weight of the water, fish, and equipment inside the aquarium without a specialized stand. It also will not yellow and is generally cheaper to ship.
Acrylic is lighter weight and more difficult to crack or fracture. Acrylic tanks are also easier to mold into different shapes and can more readily be outfitted with an overflow system.

, Filtration systems include mechanical, biological, and chemical components, but you largely focus on picking the mechanical portion. There are some half a dozen common filter varieties available for aquariums to meet different needs.Power filters are the most widely-used filtration system by hobbyists. They hang on the back of the tank and filter through an intake tube and pass through a chemical filter as well as a biological sponge before going back into the tank.
Trickle filters, also called wet/dry filters, are commonly favored for saltwater tanks. They make use of a biological filter in one compartment before filtering into an activated carbon unit and filtering back into the aquarium.
Corner filters, also known as box filters, are an affordable option that often sit in the corner of the tank. They work best for small tanks.
Canister filters are powerful mechanical filters useful for large aquariums. They sit under the aquarium, and are powerful for large, multi-fish setups.

, Tropical fish in particular require certain climate control to keep them comfortable and healthy. Look into the temperatures necessary to keep your fish happy and decide on a heating setup if you need one.The size of heater you need will depend upon the size of tank you have. Check the heater packaging to make sure you are getting a heater that is appropriate for your tank size.
Even if you do not require a heater for your aquarium, use a thermometer to ensure the climate inside the aquarium is stable.

, Proper lighting is necessary to ensure that your fish and any plant life in your aquarium are healthy. Pick a lighting setup that will work to give you the aesthetic you want while maintaining a healthy aquarium.Standard and compact fluorescent light bulbs are common, easy to replace, and favored by beginners and experienced hobbyists.
Metal halides are preferable for large aquarium systems.
LED light systems are increasingly more common, but can be variable in the amount of photosynthetically  active radiation that they put out. Check with a local aquarium store to find the right LED setup for your aquarium.

, The right substrate will depend on what types of fish you have, as well as whether you have live plants or reef components in your aquarium. Choose a substrate that will support all the fish and plant life in your aquarium.Gravel and sand are common aquarium substrates and are advisable for fish-only aquariums with no living plant life.
Aragonite and crushed corals provide a useful substrate for reef aquariums and marine life aquariums that include crustaceans and bottom-feeders.
Vermiculite and laterite are nutrient-rich substrates that will help a planted tank grow and thrive.

, Some form of vegetation or hiding space should be made available to the fish. Decide if you want live or synthetic plants in your aquarium, and consider other functional decorations that may provide stimulation for the fish.Whether using live or synthetic plants, opt for plants that resemble those found in your fish’s natural habitats. This helps encourage healthy biological behavior.
If you choose to use live plants, make sure the plants you get are compatible with your aquarium setup. Check the plant tags for lighting, temperature, and water pH requirements.

, A hood provides necessary protection for your aquarium, and may help hide some components such as lighting and filtration. Find a hood to fit the physical dimensions of your tank.Often, you can find tanks that come with the hood as a part of the package at local pet stores and specialty aquarium stores.
Check to make sure that your hood can physically accommodate your lighting, filtration, and other aquarium components and still close properly.

, If you have an acrylic tank, a stand is necessary. Even with a glass aquarium, you may want a stand to bring the aquarium up to eye level and keep it safe within the space. Find a stand that meets your needs.If you have an external filtration system, the stand will often serve to conceal the filter components.
Stands come in a variety of sizes and styles to fit different aquariums and aesthetics. Check local aquarium stores and look online to see what is available to you.

, Once you know what you want for your tank, it is time to purchase. Checking a local shop is always a good place to start as it allows you to see what shapes, sizes, and features are available to you.Bring a tape measurer and measure tanks with stands to ensure they will fit properly in their intended area.
Be willing to shop around. Different stores with different focuses will likely have different options. A pet store will have all the things a beginner needs, but more advanced aquarists may benefit from specialized options at aquarium stores.

, Often, tank dealers will bundle certain items such as the tank, stand, lighting, and filtration system. These will have a higher price tag than the tank, alone, but will often save you money on your overall tank setup.


If you know of a tank brand you like, contact the dealer directly or check their website to see if they are offering any exclusive bundle deals.

, When a hobbyist makes the move to a larger tank, they will often look to sell their old tank setup. Check local ads in the paper and online to see if there is anyone in your area selling an aquarium in the size range you want.When reviewing these ads, always ask to see what is included. Sometimes, a substantial amount of the setup may be included while other sellers may be offering the tank alone.

, Often, you can find deals on aquariums online. Check with pet stores and major online retailers to see if they have a tank sized to meet your needs. Check the product dimensions carefully, though, and measure your space before ordering.Online ordering is particularly useful for individual aquarium components, as well as for small aquariums. Large aquariums may be cumbersome to retrieve and may cost a great deal in shipping.

, If you have the means, a custom-built tank may work well for you. Working with an aquarium builder, you have the chance to design a customized tank that meets your specific size and space requirements.Custom builds are often costly, but will include everything from the tank, itself, to a stand and full filtration system.
These builds are generally preferred for larger tanks.

Plan ahead.,
Get a large enough tank.,
Clean everything using hot water.,
Place the tank in a place that does not get too much sunlight.,
Add the water filter and heater.,
Fill the bottom 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to xx centimeters) with a clean substrate.,
Don't worry about plants.,
Choose some clean rocks with caves, pockets, or holes, and arrange them in your tank.,
Fill the tank with water.,
Place the cover on the tank and plug everything in.,
Wait until the tank cycle has established before adding your fish.,
Stick with only one species of cichlid.,
Buy cichlids together when they are about the same size.,
Plan on having 2 female cichlids for every male.,
Choose tank mates with care.,
Consider adding a bottom feeder.",How to Set up a Cichlid Tank," It is not a good idea to add fish into your tank the instant you finish filling it up with water. In order to be safe for fish, a tank needs time to build up the good bacteria and establish a natural cycle. Plan on setting up your tank about a month before adding your fish.;
, Most cichlids grow to be 5 to 6 inches (cc centimeters) long, but some can grow up to 12 inches (cc centimeters) long. Plan on getting a tank that is at least 29 gallons (109.78 liters), although a 50 gallon (189.27 liters) tank would be better.Also, because cichlids like to hide amongst rocks, a long, low, horizontal tank would be better than a tall, thin, vertical tank.If you are starting out with a 29 gallon (109.78 liter) tank, you will need to upgrade to a larger tank after about 1 year as the fish grow larger.

, Rinse your tank, gravel, and rocks under hot water. Do not use any soap or detergents. It would be a good idea to clean even store-bought and packaged items, as they usually contain dust and traces of chemicals that may be harmful to your fish.


To clean your substrate, place it in a strainer, and rinse it with hot water until the water runs clear.

, Live plants don't fare well in cichlid tanks, so sunlight is not necessary. Also, too much sunlight will encourage algae growth.

, Place the filter and heater in the back so that they will be hidden by rocks when you add them in. Also, try to place the heater near the water filter. The water current will help distribute the warmth throughout the tank.Don't skimp on the filter. Cichlids can create a lot of waste. A good quality canister-style filter would be ideal, even for smaller tanks.
Try to get a metal heater instead of a glass one. Cichlids like to move rocks about, which can easily break a glass heater. , Try to choose pebbles for the substrate. It will look the most natural. Avoid using fine gravel, as it can easily by swallowed by larger cichlids.The gravel layer does not have to be even. Consider making it thicker in some parts, and thinner in other.Consider adding some crushed coral to maintain pH levels. Because crushed coral is very sharp, it might be better to place the crushed coral into bags, and keep the bags in the filter., Most plants don't handle the high pH levels and hard water necessary for cichlids. Usually, aquarium hobbyists will use plants to control nitrates. Because of the water requirements for a cichlid tank, this is not possible. Instead, hobbyists will control nitrate levels by changing the water regularly.


Cichlids may also uproot or eat the plants.

, This will give your fish some hiding places. To create the most natural look, try to use an odd number of rocks. Don't spend too much time and effort arranging your rocks. Cichlids like to excavate and move things around.


Consider including some white limestone rocks to help maintain the proper pH levels.
You can even use pieces of coral or small clay pots. Avoid driftwood, as it can change the water pH and hardness.To create more depth, consider placing the larger rocks towards the back, and the smaller rocks towards the front., To keep the water from disrupting the substrate too much, consider placing a plate on the substrate first. Use a rubber tube to siphon the water into the tank. Fill the tank until the water level is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the top. This will ensure that your fish get enough oxygen.


If you use a plate, be sure to take it out when you are done filling the tank.
Do not add your fish yet. Make sure to add a tap water conditioner.

, Don't worry if the water flow churns up the sediments and makes everything cloudy. Things will settle down.


Covers are good ideas for any fish tank. Not only do they help keep the water clean from dust, but they also prevent fish from jumping out.
Because cichlid tanks don't have live plants, bright lights are not necessary. A soft light, however, can help bring out the colors of your fish.

, This can take anywhere from several weeks to a month. Perform a water test every week. When the nitrate and pH levels are appropriate for your fish, you can go to the fish store and buy your fish.The specific pH, temperature, and water hardness levels will vary depending on the species and breed of cichlid, but listed below are the most common ones:


The pH should be between 7.8 and 8.5. Some dwarf cichlids prefer a pH between 6.0 and 6.5.
The water hardness should be between 10 and 15dH. If the area you live in has very soft water, you can add some aragonite.The temperature should be between 72°F and 82°F (22°C-28°C).

, Cichlids tend to be aggressive even towards other species of cichlids. It might be a good idea to just choose one species and stick with it. The two main species are African and South American. There are many different breeds within each species, and it is generally safe to mix those., This will help ensure that they all grow up to be a similar size. It is not a good idea to mix small and large cichlids together. Some of the larger ones may try to bully the smaller ones.

, This will prevent aggression and fighting among the males. It may also help prevent aggression towards female cichlids as well.

, Many fish do not do well in a cichlid tank, partly due to the high pH, acidity, and water hardness required for cichlids to flourish. Another reason many fish do not do well in a cichlid tank is because of how large and aggressive cichlids can get. Many hobbyists have witnessed cichlids bullying and even eating smaller fish., A snail, such as an apple snail, would be great for keeping the walls of your tank clean. A bottom feeder, such as a plecostomus, would be great for keeping the substrate clean. The plecostomus is an appropriate tank mate for a cichlid because it has thick skin and sharp spines."

Freshwater, relatively fast-growing fish {genus/family (species)} are:

Tilapia (e.g. O. niloticus, Taiwan Red, ND56, O. mossambiccus, etc)
Catfish (e.g. Pangasius Catfish, Channel Catfish)
Carp (e.g. Lampan (Tinfoil barb), Jelawat (Mad barb), Silver Carp, Grass carp)

Shrimp

;
, You can grow marine fish using freshwater by tweaking Polyvalent Cation Sensing Receptor (PVCR) modulators in the water. pH, temperature, hardness, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, phosphates, biological oxygen demand, carbon dioxide, turbidity, coliform bacteria and macroinvertebrates are the properties of water that have to be monitored as tight as according to fish sensitivity to them.

, Some people prefer live glass shrimps as feed for intensive tanks because glass shrimps are very high in protein (40% proteins in wet weight) and they are slow to get caught by the fish. Well, some uses fish pellets which can be fed using an automatic timer feeder, which some of the hobbyist types can be as big as 37 litres. Some folks use duckweed which provides about 25% - 45% crude proteins in dry weight basis. However, the FCR for duckweed at around 3.87 and the high moisture content of 93% makes duckweed a poor feed and unrealistic for aquaculture. One tilapia at mature weight of 1kg will require the sustenance from 49 sqm of well-fertilised duckweed pond. Among these foods, you have to take into consideration the feed your fish may prefer, as some carnivorous fish requires at least 40% protein-based diet. Research also show that low carbohydrate protein-based diet yields better than a high carbohydrate-to-protein ratio feed. Daily feeding rates are highly dependent on fish type and age. A high quality feed should consist of adequate digestible proteins and calories.
An example of feeding regimen is as follows and use the following formula: Feed quantity = (number of fish in cage × average body weight of fish) × % daily feeding rate., Feed them with fish pellets and aerate the water which is very crucial. Do not place glass shrimps together with fish. For there are many kinds of duckweed, the smaller they are the better at biomass yields (e.g. Wolffia globosa, Lemna minor). The optimum growth rate under sunlight is an area doubled in 0.75~2 days. If your growth rate is lower than this, optimise the growth condition by fertilising the water, increase water temperature, etc. Aside from fertilising the water, you may use filthy water from fish vessel and make an integrated aquaponic project. Always harvest duckweed as long as vegetation is dense, and must leave spaces in between duckweed.

, Fish excretes ammonia as waste. Nevertheless, fish slime and pelletised feed can introduce considerable amount of crude proteins, which grows bacteria that decompose the nitrogenous wastes. In freshwater designs, water-floating plant is used to promptly absorb nitrogenous wastes which are ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. This is a holistic way to assimilate nitrate. Microbial digesters whether it is aerobic or anaerobic digesters have certain limitation in converting nitrates into nitrogen gas. Then, plants come into play very well in doing the job in lacking. In saltwater aspect, you may use Caulerpa sp. or Salicornia plant instead to scrub nitrogenous waste. Plants are the best biofilter as they are full spectrum. Water lettuce has high nitrogen assimilation (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate), has small individual sizes but dense roots. Commonly, aquarists love to apply biofilter which resides oxidising bacteria that convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate. When ammonia is depleted, these bacteria also scrub nitrite, but they are not the big users of nitrogenous wastes, rather they extract metabolic energy from turning the toxic ammonia into decreasingly potent oxidised forms, i.e. nitrite then nitrate. That is why plants are preferred than bacteria as they are high users of nitrogenous waste and much cleanly assimilate nitrogenous waste from water. In plants, especially water-floating plants, leaf is a major part of the organs that absorbs nutrients and followed by the root system. Plants preferably assimilate ammonia than nitrite, and nitrite than nitrate as additional energy is required to reduce the oxidised forms to form immediate substrates in amino acid biosynthesis. The major purpose of water-floating plant is to assimilate nitrogenous waste.

, This is an ultra-low maintenance aquaculture setup. It needs no water changes, but only requires electricity, sunlight and air. It is not consuming energy to drive water uphill when placing aquaponic trays at the same level as fish tanks. By the way, just do not forget that fish cannot eat if they cannot see the food, so allow plenty of light.


A fine solid remover, which is a cyclone, drastically slows down water speed and allow solid residues to sink by gravity to the bottom of the container. A timed water pump draws the solid-laden fluid from the cyclone bottom at intervals.
A pellet feeder is used to achieve low monitoring.

, There should always be more than one oxygenator (aerator) in an aquarium system because break down of this important device can cause fish fatality in short time. To make a forced-air pump-aerator, connect the inlet of a water pump to a diaphragm air pump (normal aquarium air pump). Blades of the water pump slice air into very small bubbles, which can be way smaller than that of Venturi pumps.


Numerous people have voiced that blade-crushing of air can cause ""eating away"" of the pump blades which is not true. Blade-crushing as compared to venturi aeration is better, since energy is not wasted in accelerating water but rather creating smaller air bubbles. As for this particular design of oxygenator, it has been proven to be very effective at creating the smallest bubbles with high energy efficacy. Smaller bubbles are also easier to stabilise in water and stay with longer retention time. If you rear air-breathing fish such as snakeheads, an aerator is not needed.

, Aquaponic trays are connected to fish tanks by a pump and solids remover. The aquaponic trays contain water-floating plants or vegetables which absorb NPK residues at higher limits that can be harmful to fish. Water lettuce is an excellent non-vegetable floating plant which assimilates nitrogenous wastes. The plant roots can be eaten by fish and must therefore be placed in aquaponic tanks, not fish tanks. These plants would quickly absorb harmful ammonia from the water. Often when ammonia is depleted, the plants switch to nitrite assimilation, and then nitrate.


Place coral bones or calcium shells in the tray to stabilise the water pH at around 7. As oxygenator introduces carbon dioxide that decrease water pH gets in contact with calcium shells, this hardens the water by producing soluble calcium bicarbonate (carbonic acid + calcium carbonate -> calcium bicarbonate). Most importantly, neutral pKa of calcium bicarbonate maintains proper pH of water, reducing the formation of unionised form of ammonia (NH3) which is harmful to fish. , Fertilisers can replenish nutrients required by the aquaponic aspect but care should be taken to not apply too much at once. Fish feed and fish excretion themselves are most of the time enough to supplement the needs of the plants. Salt provides the most effective bath treatment, and is used to eliminate ciliated protozoan parasites, such as ich. Salt is used to curb the absorption of nitrite which causes gill diseases, and to mediate the osmotic pressure exerted by freshwater on wounds in the skin and gill.


To produce a 0.3% salt solution (a treatment dosage against most protozoan parasites), 1 tablespoon of salt is used per gallon of water; to produce a 0.6% salt solution (a treatment dosage against Trichodina), 2 tablespoons of salt for every one gallon of water; and to produce a 0.9% salt solution, 3 tablespoons of salt for every one gallon of water., Depending on your vessel size, put enough fish (determined by the volume of eventual matured fish). The rule of thumb is the lower fish stocking density, the faster fish grow. The maximum stocking density for any fish is 150kg adult size per unit cubic meter, which is extremely not recommended. It is better to mix different species of fish (polyculture) as this reduces fish fight. You should also put fish of same sizes and prevent ornamental items in fish tanks to avoid territorial fights as much as possible.

, Covering your tank is crucial as you do not want every visit greeted by dead fish on the floor. Put also some mosquito fish in aquaponic trays to devour mosquito larva as this project can breed tons of mosquito.

,


Slanting waterbed designs allow efficient collection of excretory solids into treatment plants
Settling basin - further separate solids from water, sludge is dispatched at intervals, clean water is recycled back into system
Biofilter - natural-living microorganisms are bred in biofilters to disintegrate soluble waste in the water. Together with biofilter, it is also recommended to add arrays of water plants or hydroponics to sequester water-soluble nitrogenous wastes from the water.
Oxygenator - to saturate the water with oxygen and increase dissolved oxygen (DO) before water is released into pond. In large-scale aquaculture, it is not recommended to run aerators intermittently, but to trickle the flow until the water output is constantly saturated with fine air bubbles, so as to reduce waterborne diseases and increase fish metabolism.

Choose plastic canvas to prevent small fish from swimming through. Use egg crates if it’s okay for smaller fish or babies to swim on both sides of the divider., Measure the height and width of your tank where you want to divide it. Use these measurements to determine how large the canvas or egg crates need to be. Buy the dividing material in the size you need or cut it to size if it is too big. Combine pieces of the material if you can’t buy a size that easily fits into your tank.Ensure the divider is taller than the water level so fish cannot swim over the divider.
Combine plastic canvas by attaching pieces together with fishing line.
Glue multiple egg crates together with silicone if you need a larger divider.

, Make a plastic canvas divider more secure by putting two pieces of material together. Doubling the canvas also makes it harder for fish to see each other through the divider. Use plants or moss in between the doubled material to further prevent fish from seeing each other through the divider.

Stick your plants or moss in the middle of two pieces of plastic canvas or two egg crates. The moss will grow outward and make an excellent nesting, play and resting area.

, Use the spines from two report covers to make your frame. Start by pulling the sliding plastic spines off the report covers. Slide one spine on each long side of the mesh or plastic canvas to make the bars of the frame. Cut to size if needed.Consider making the frame sturdier by adding a third spine on the bottom of the canvas.
Look for report covers in an office supply store.
Use snap frames for poster boards instead of report cover spines for a more sturdy frame.
Don’t bother with a frame for egg crates.

, Tuck the sides of the frame or the egg crate under the lip of the tank. Aim for a very snug fit. You can further secure the divider with suction cups. Attach suction cups to the frame with fishing line. Use plastic zip ties to attach them to the egg crate.You might need to cut the sides of the frame down for them to fit.
Add an extra piece of plastic canvas on the outside of the frame if there is a gap between the suction cups and the sides of the tank. Do this to prevent fish from swimming through the gaps.

, Glue the thinnest sides of the egg crates to the tank with aquarium-safe pure silicon. Use a marker to draw a line on the outside of the tank to guide where the silicone needs to go. Then add the silicone and slide in the divider. Remove the marker with rubbing alcohol or a similar cleaning agent.

Look for this silicone in pet stores, craft shops, online, or in building supply stores.
Do this in a dry tank for best results.

, If the divider doesn’t fit snugly under the lip of the tank, secure it on top. Use duct tape or tie small weights onto it that overhang on the outside of the tank. Alternatively, attach suction cups to the top of the divider and secure those to the outside top of the tank. You can also use hot glue or silicone to adhere the dividers to the top of the tank.

, Don’t let the divider move on the bottom. Anchor the divider by burying it under the substrate at the bottom of the fish tank. You can also prop it in place by shoring up rocks on either side of the divider., Never make a tank divider out of wire, harmful metals, or sharp materials. Thoroughly clean any materials you might be reusing to make the divider. Check with your vet or pet store if you’re unsure about the safety of any items you want to put in your fish tank."

Buy additional supplies including a filter to keep the water clean, a heater, a power head for surface agitation, and a fish net so you don’t infect fish in your main aquarium. These supplies can ensure the health and vitality of your quarantined fish until you reintroduce them to their primary tank.Get an aquarium test kit for pH, ammonia, nitrate and nitrate if you don’t already have one to ensure that the tank water quality is high.
The larger the fish, the more space you’ll need to house the quarantined fish.;
, Clean the quarantine tank thoroughly with hot water before adding water. Place it in a spot that is dark to keep your fish calmer.Then use water from your main tank to fill the quarantine tank. This can ensure that your fish quickly acclimate to their new aquarium.Avoid using soap when cleaning the tank because the chemicals can be toxic to fish.

, Consider your quarantine tank like an extension of your main tank. Place the filter, heater, and power head into the tank. Placing a few decorations and hiding spots can also help your fish feel more comfortable in their new surroundings., Allow the filter to cycle a few times and start the power head to clean and aerate the quarantine tank water. Take the temperature of the water to ensure it’s the same as the main tank. Use your testing kit to ensure the pH is also similar or the same as the main tank. Making sure that the quarantine tank environment is the same or close to your main tank can maintain the vitality and health of your fish—and their offspring., Fill a plastic bag with tank water so you can place the fish you want to transfer into it. Using your new tank net, fish out the animal you want to quarantine. Then place the fish in the plastic bag and move it to the new tank. Removing your fish this way can minimize its stress and help maintain its vitality.If you have new fish, keep them in their plastic bag to prevent shock., Float the sealed plastic bag with your fish in the quarantine tank. Leave the bag in the water for 15 minutes so that fish can gradually adjust to the water temperature. Cut the bag open the bag and allow the fish to swim free in the quarantine tank. Taking the time to acclimate your fish to the quarantine tank can minimize the risk of shocking the fish, which can harm its health., For 3-4 weeks, closely watch the health and vitality of your quarantined fish.Look for the following symptoms of potential problems so you can ensure prompt treatment or remove male fish from the quarantine breeding tank:White spots or velvety patches on the body
Missing scales or incomplete fins
Cloudy or bulging eyes
Ulcers or other lesions
Rapid breathing, gasping at the surface and shaking
Erratic swimming
Listlessness or sulking in a corner
A bubble nest from male fish, If any of your quarantined fish are ill or get sick, decide on the best course of treatment for it. This may include things such as improving water quality through cleaning or giving the fish medication.Extend the quarantine at least two weeks from the time you start treatment to ensure that the fish can heal without additional problems arising. Once the fish appears healthy, leave it in the quarantine for an additional week., Once your fish is healthy, remove it from the quarantine tank with the new net. Place the fish in a plastic bag with water from the tank. Then put the sealed, plastic bag in the main tank for 10-15 minutes. Open the bag and let your fish swim free.[[


Avoid mixing quarantine water into your main tank, as it could still contain medications harmful to your other fish.

, Disinfect your tank and equipment once the quarantine is over. Mix 200mg bleach with one liter of water in the tank. Use more for larger tanks. Scrub down the tank surfaces and equipment with the bleach mixture and rinse thoroughly with clean water when you’re done.Allow the tank and equipment to air dry, which can kill any lingering pathogens. Then store the tank in a clean, dry spot in your home."

Do a 30% water change as soon as possible.,
Lower the amount of food you are giving your fish.,
Follow the general rule of thumb, which is to have 1 inch (2.5 cm) of adult fish per gallon.,
Test your water source for nitrate directly if after previous steps you still have high levels.",How to Lower Your Nitrate/Nitrite Levels in Your Fish Tank," In order to maintain a fish tank, you should be doing at least a 25% water change every week. When you do a water change, you are removing nitrate-laden water and replacing it with fresh, nitrate-free water. Leaving this too long will result in a build-up of nitrate that can harm your fish.;
, Remember that a fish's stomach is around the same size as his eye. A little food goes a long way.


If you are giving fish several different kinds of foods (brine shrimp, blood worms, flakes, etc. ) then make sure the amount is controlled.
Place the food at feeding times in a place where the fish will actually be able to find and eat it.
Remove any uneaten food from the tank with a gravel vacuum or clean turkey baster.

, Remember that this guideline is only for smaller tropical fish. A 12-inch pleco cannot fit into a 12 gallon (45.4 L) tank, and a 10-inch fish has no place in a 30 gallon (113.6 L) tank. Use your common sense.

A test kit can tell you whether you have elevated ammonia levels. Keep one on hand in case you notice any symptoms.
Follow the directions on the packaging. If the test indicates any level of ammonia, that is too much.;
, The only safe level of ammonia is zero. If your test kit detects any amount of ammonia, you need to perform a water change. This process can take several days.Changing the water is the only safe way to lower ammonia levels. Products that promise to remove ammonia might have negative side effects, so they should be avoided.
A water change means that you will remove 10-15% of the water in the tank. Use a clean bucket or jug to remove the water.
Replace the water with fresh water. Use dechlorinated tap water.
Continue changing the water over the next 2-3 days until there is no trace of ammonia. You do not need to remove your fish or any plants that are in your tank.

, The process by which you keep the water in your aquarium healthy for your fish is known as ""cycling"". The primary reason to cycle your aquarium is to ensure that the levels of ammonia and nitrates are at the proper level. You can cycle a new tank or an already established tank.A full cycle will take 4-6 weeks to complete. Begin by placing all new water in your tank.
With a new aquarium, start slowly. Let the aquarium run for at least a day before adding fish.
Add fish slowly. Do not add more than 3 new fish per week to any tank.
Purchase a cycling aid product. You can ask for these at your local pet or fish supply store. There are several brands that will contain bacteria to supplement your tank.
These products will help promote healthy bacteria in your tank. Follow the instructions on the product packaging.

, When you are preparing and cycling an aquarium, it is important to keep a log of the components of your tank water. Closely monitor the levels of ammonia, nitrate, and pH. Keeping careful records can help you notice changes and correct the levels as fast as possible.You can write down all of the chemical levels in your water. You can also note factors such as temperature level and population statistics.
There are many websites and apps that can help you monitor your tank. Some sites offer basic memberships for free.Other sites are more sophisticated. You can purchase memberships if you need to monitor several aquariums.

, A filtration system is key to lowering and regulating ammonia levels. A good filter will regulate and neutralize ammonia and nitrates. It will also remove floating debris from your tank.Purchase the best filter for your tank. Filters come in many sizes and price ranges, so do your research.
Read reviews online. You should also talk to experienced employees at your local pet store.
Power filters are commonly used for tanks up to 55 gallons. They are used to increase biological filtration, which means you can keep more fish in your tank.
If your tank is larger than 55 gallons, consider getting a Canister filter. They are the most powerful and effective for large tanks.

, This means placing the tank on a table or an aquarium stand. Place the filter/bubbler in, as shown in the manual. This varies by product. Make sure it is set up properly.

, Some aquariums come with stones/gravel already included.

, This may include real plants, fake plants, rocks, or other decorative items. Remember to rinse the (fake) plants and hiding spots for the fish. Never put rocks that you found outside in your tank. These may cause illness to the fish.

, Make sure the heater, filter and/or bubbler works properly. Make sure the temperature is perfect. Different fish like different temperatures.

, Once everything is set up, you have to wait a week or two before you can buy any fish. This establishes the tank making sure it is safe for the fish. ], These are always a good thing to have available for the cleaning of the tank. Fish, like black Mollies, need to have freshwater salt or else they will not live as long.

, The pH of the tank is important, as the water being too acidic or basic may kill your fish. Pet stores sell pH tests, along with many solutions to adjust the pH of your tank. Some fish may flourish under certain pH levels as well, while some may suffer.

, They may get crowded and scared. Remember, you should have no more than ten 1-2 inch fish in the tank. Putting in too many fish at once can cause overcrowding!


Recommended fish are guppies, platies, small tetras, hasbrosus corydoras (or other small cories), mollies, and small barbs. The store workers can help answer your questions and help you choose appropriate fish for beginners or experts!

",How to Prepare Fish Tank Gravel,"


Fish tank gravel comes in several varieties, such as glass, hard gel or stone, and may be natural or dyed. For the best results, look for natural gravel or varieties with a polymer seal so it is not likely to alter your tank's chemistry and harm your fish or other aquatic life.;
, It should indicate this on the packaging and say that it is pre-washed.

, Gravel that is not smooth or has jagged edges can harm the fish and other life forms in your tank.

,, Run warm water over it for several minutes, or until the water runs clear.


If the package of the gravel you purchase does not indicate that it has been prewashed, put your gravel in a pot and boil it for a few minutes. Then rinse it thoroughly.

, This will help remove any chemicals from the tap water that might alter the pH balance in your tank.

,, Put a layer of gravel that is about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) evenly over the entire tank bottom.

You should aim to do a partial water change about once a week, though you may need to do it more often, depending on your tank's conditions. A good way to check if you need to do partial changes more frequently is by stirring up the substrate gravel with a fish net. If a lot of debris floats up, it's a good sign you're not changing the water often enough.Let fresh water sit out overnight to dechlorinate, or treat the fresh water with a dechlorination product.
Wash your hands and make sure you've washed away all residue of soap, lotions, and other potential contaminants. Dry your hands with a clean paper towel.
Disconnect any electrical appliances near the fish tank to prevent any risk of accidental electrocution. Wait to reconnect those appliances until you've finished changing the water and checked that everything is dry.
For an otherwise healthy tank, you can aim to replace about 30% of the water. In a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank, that means replacing 3 gallons (11.4 L) of water.
You don't necessarily need to remove the fish for a partial water change. Just be careful as you put your hands in the tank so you don't startle the fish.
Scrape off any algae that's grown on the walls of the tank. You can buy a specialized tool for scraping algae, or simply use an old credit card.
Use a siphon tube to drain out 30% of the old water into a bucket or nearby sink. When you've removed enough of the old water, slowly pour in the fresh, dechlorinated water.;
, Decaying organic matter is a large factor in elevated ammonia levels. By using a fish net to scoop out anything that shouldn't be there (basically anything but the living fish and plants you want in the tank), you can help lower ammonia levels and prevent them from rising.Uneaten food is a large contributor to ammonia levels.
Fish waste can also cause spikes in ammonia as it decomposes.
Dead plant matter or dead fish left in your tank will release large concentrations of ammonia.
Try cleaning out the filter in your tank, as this could reintroduce built-up organic matter back into the water. Don't replace the filter pads, though, as you may upset the bacterial balance in the water.

, If your fish leaves behind a lot of uneaten food, that food could be the reason for your tank's elevated ammonia levels. By reducing how much food is available in the tank, you'll lower the opportunities for ammonia levels to rise.Make sure your fish is still getting enough food. Talk to a veterinarian or fish expert on how much food your fish needs to stay healthy.
Be aware that changing your fish's feeding habits won't reduce ammonia levels that are already high; it will, however, prevent future spikes in ammonia levels once the water has been changed.

, The bacterial colonies that usually line a well-established fish tank's bottom help convert ammonia into its relatively benign nitrogen components.If your tank is new or if the bacterial colony has been drastically reduced, you may be experiencing what some fish experts call ""new tank syndrome.""


Some people introduce bacteria by putting one or two inexpensive fish in the tank so that the fish's waste can bring in bacteria. If going this route, you may use a goldfish for a cold water tank, barbs for a warm tank, or damselfish for a saltwater tank.
You can also add healthy bacteria by introducing a handful of gravel from an older fish tank to your new fish tank's bottom.

, Ammonia is either un-ionized as NH3 or ionized as ammonium (NH4+). Un-ionized ammonia (NH3) is the form that is toxic to fish, and is generally in greatest concentration when the water's pH is basic (high on the pH scale).Adding chemical pH adjusters (from your local pet store) is probably the easiest way to lower the pH of your tank.
Lowering the pH won't remove the ammonia, but it can render it less dangerous if you need to buy some time before you can change the water.
One easy way to maintain lower pH levels is to make sure you use actual gravel for the substrate (bottom) of your fish tank. Using crushed coral or coral sand releases calcium in the water that can cause spikes in pH., NH3, the form of ammonia that is toxic, is a dissolved gas that permeates the water. By increasing the aeration of your tank's water, it might help diffuse that ammonia gas out of the water and into the air.Aeration won't do much in a large pond, but it might help manage ammonia levels in your fish tank.
You can buy an aeration pump at most pet stores or online.
Make sure you leave your tank uncovered if you normally have a lid on. As the ammonia gas diffuses, it will need to be able to travel outside of the tank.

, One way to temporarily fix the ammonia levels in your tank is by using neutralizing drops.You can buy these at most pet stores, or order them online.


Neutralizing drops do not actually remove ammonia from the water. Instead, the drops will neutralize the toxic effects of ammonia, rendering it harmless in the water.
You'll still need biological filtration (from bacteria) to break down ammonia into nitrite and nitrate.

, It's relatively rare that tap water would be significantly high in ammonia. Most municipal water systems test the concentration of chemicals like ammonia to ensure that the water is safe to drink. However, it may be worth checking if you're doing everything else right and the ammonia levels are still not dropping.Use the ammonia testing kit you would use for the fish tank on your tap water.
If the ammonia levels are high in your tap water, talk to a representative from your municipal water district.

, Decomposing material inside the tank is one of the biggest causes of high ammonia levels. By evaluating the contents of your tank's water, you'll have a clearer idea of what needs to be done to correct the problem.Any decomposing organic matter, including aquatic plants and microorganisms, can cause a spike in ammonia levels as protein breaks down.
Uneaten food can also cause spikes in ammonia levels as it breaks down in the water.Scoop out any matter that shouldn't be in the tank promptly. Make sure you maintain your tank's regular schedule for changing or partially changing the water.

, If you see a lot of fish waste floating around in your tank, it could be the source of your elevated ammonia levels. Your fish's waste will gradually break down, just like decomposing organic matter, causing ammonia levels to rise in the water.You can manage fish waste by scooping out solids whenever you see them and changing or partially changing your tank's water on a regular basis.

, Most pet stores sell ammonia test kits. These kits check the total ammonia levels (which includes both ammonia and ammonium). The problem with this is that the tests do not distinguish between the two distinct ammonia levels, meaning you may not be able to accurately assess how toxic the water is.As a general rule, if your tank is established (meaning it's been inhabited and has active bacterial colonies), you should not be able to detect any ammonia with a standard kit.
If these tests indicate a measurable level of ammonia and you know there is already a healthy bacterial colony and a lack of organic matter, it's most likely a problem with your filter.

, Your tank's pH can directly affect the ammonia levels in the water. By measuring the pH levels on a regular basis, you'll help ensure that ammonia levels are not toxic.The pH of a body of water affects how much ammonia is ionized versus how much remains un-ionized.
You'll still need to treat the water beyond adjusting the pH, as acidifying the water will not actually break down the ammonia that's already present.

, Depending on when you test your tank's water, you might be getting an artificially-high reading. The best time to test the water would probably be right before feeding, as new food has not yet broken down in the water.Ammonia levels reach their peak approximately 90 minutes after your fish have been fed.
Testing the water shortly after your fish have eaten (and are producing waste) can give you an inaccurately-high reading of ammonia levels.

Introduce new fish slowly.,
Know the signs of a problem.,
Protect your fish.",How to Lower Ammonia Levels in Your Fish Tank2," Ammonia can be toxic to tropical fish. For this reason, it is important to regularly monitor the water quality of your tank. You should also only add new fish gradually to your tank.Fish are responsible for some of the ammonia output that inevitably ends up in your tank. When you are setting up a new tank, introduce fish slowly.
Add tropical fish to your tank in small groups. Monitor the water to make sure that the ammonia levels are remaining steady.
Ammonia is lethal, so try to keep your levels as close to zero as possible. 0 is the ideal level of ammonia in a fish tank.

, In addition to checking your water, you can look for other symptoms that your ammonia levels are too high. The primary symptom is the death of a new fish. If you add a new fish to a previously healthy tank, that fish might be reacting to unexpected ammonia.Fish who are suffering from ammonia poisoning have trouble getting oxygen they need from the water. Ammonia causes fish gills to stick together and fish can't breathe.
On many tropical fish, you can visually see their gills moving. If you can't see the gills moving anymore, your fish might be in distress.
Non-lethal levels of ammonia can still be a problem. Fish exposed to ammonia will experience stress and might behave differently than usual. They may swim faster than usual or appear erratic in their movements.

, Remember to always take care to keep your fish safe and healthy. If you discover that ammonia levels are too high, take steps to lower them immediately. You should also take precautions to try to prevent levels from rising.Protect your fish by carefully monitoring your population. If a fish dies, it's a sign there might be a problem with your water.
Make sure to relocate your fish if your filter breaks. Consider having a back up tank so that your fish will have a safe place to go.

Set up a water care schedule.,
Perform regular maintenance.,
Feed your fish properly.,
Create a healthy home for your fish.",How to Lower Ammonia Levels in Your Fish Tank3," In addition to monitoring and regulating ammonia levels, there are several things you can do to keep your aquarium healthy. Make it a habit to care for your tank water regularly. For example, you should check the water temperature every day.On a weekly basis, replace 10% of the water with dechlorinated water.You should also test your water for nitrates and ammonia weekly.
Each month, change 25% of your water. You should also perform any necessary filter maintenance.
On a monthly basis, scrub the algae from your tank. Prune live plants if you have them.
Write down your maintenance schedule on your calendar so that you keep track of each of your steps.

, Part of maintaining a healthy aquarium is to provide the proper amount of lighting. Most fish need 8-10 hours per day. Make sure that they are getting the correct amount of light.You can purchase lights with timers for your aquarium. This will ensure that you are not over or under lighting them.
Practice precaution after a power failure. Even a brief loss of power can cause stress for your fish.
After a power outage, check to make sure that all of your equipment is functioning properly.

, In order to have healthy and happy fish, you need to provide them with the proper diet. What you feed them will depend on what type of fish you have. Make sure that you are purchasing the right food for your aquarium.Make sure not to overfeed your fish. That can cause the tank to become contaminated.
Experiment to find the right amount of food. Your fish should eat their fill in about 5 minutes.
If it takes them longer than 5 minutes, reduce the amount. If they finish quickly, add more food.
Try to feed the fish at the same time each day. Keeping to a schedule will help you keep track of feedings.

, An important part of keeping your fish healthy is to carefully control the population. When you are increasing the population, it is best to increase your number gradually. Do not add more than 3 fish at a time.Purchase healthy fish. The best way to do this is to go to a reputable supplier. Read reviews from other customers.
Make sure to acclimate new fish. Keep them in their bag for the first 15-20 minutes that they are in the aquarium.
If you have had to medicate your fish, take extra precautions to keep the others healthy. Perform water changes more frequently to make sure you get rid of traces of the medication.

Test your tank water parameters.,
Check the water temperature.,
Scrape off excess bacteria and algae.,
Check the filter.,
Renew the water with a liquid water conditioner, from online, an aquarium store or pet store.,
Create an ideal environment for the beneficial bacteria.,
Clean out rotting chunks of food daily.,
Record the daily water parameter levels (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate) to compare.",How to Troubleshoot Tank Cycling Problems," People without basic test kits often have a poor time cycling tanks, and it is because water parameters are like air and food quality to humans. This includes pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels. Test strips are often vague/unclear, so many people use test kits like the Freshwater Master Test Kit (for freshwater) and other kits involving glass tube and water samples. Too high levels of ammonia can be overwhelming for the bacteria to eat. High levels of nitrite and nitrate may slow the bacteria's work down.

Fishless cycling: Tanks should have no more than 4 ppm ammonia and no less than 2 ppm. Nitrites and nitrates that are unreadable (a shade of color above the highest color on the chart) are too high.
Fish-in cycling: Tanks should have no more than 0.25 ppm of ammonia. Nitrites over 0.5 ppm are too high. While many people keep it at 0.25 ppm, others prefer to have 0 ppm (like for saltwater tanks). Nitrates over 20 ppm are too high and around 10 ppm is considered the safe range.
During a new cycling process it's usual for your tank water to become cloudy at first. Beneficial bacteria digest fish waste but the cloudiness in the water is an initial bacteria bloom that you'll see as the growing colonies start to establish while they get suctioned into your tank filter where they stay and do their work. Do not panic and try to get rid of it with chemicals/UV sterilizer, you'll just slow the beneficial cycling process down.
pH levels need to be treated (with buffers) if it is over 8 or under 6. Bacteria have different pH requirements, but too acidic or basic water can create an inhospitable environment. If you are doing a fish-in cycle, the pH should be at the level where your fish can live comfortably.;
, The tank should be around 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit (about 21-27 Celsius). Too cold or hot temperatures will slow down or kill beneficial bacteria. Plus, if you decide that your future fish need another type of environment, you could shock your bacteria by changing the temperature suddenly., A visually pleasant amount of algae and slimy growths (these are not your beneficial bacteria but other aqua creatures) are probably fine, but too much can crowd out the beneficial bacteria. They can also consume nitrites and ammonia, which are needed to feed your beneficial bacteria. Cleaning out the entire tank should not be done except yearly, but instead scrape off or pick off pieces of algae/bacteria without draining all the water., The filter media (substance in the filter cartridges) is where most of the beneficial bacteria resides. This means that the filter is the most important tank apparatus to be given care. If there is algae or other substances clogged in there, it can disrupt the natural environment. Remove the cartridge from the filter unit; rinse and squeeze the cartridge in tank water for a short time, then immediately place it back into the filter.


Never use unconditioned tap water or any soap to clean the cartridge or tank.

, Choose a product that instantly detoxifies both chlorine and chloramine as well as binding up any heavy metals. Chlorine/chemicals in tap water will kill any beneficial bacteria in an instant., Oftentimes, poor environments even by bacterial standards will provide poor results. Some people use BIO-Wheel filters in their tanks, which supposedly has more surface area and oxygenation capacity. Any filter that breaks the surface of the water will do, since this introduces oxygen into the water. An air pump is recommended. If you can, a warm environment in the high 70s to low 80s Fahrenheit (20s Celsius) is good. Again, check for water parameters and continually be on top of them.

Live plants will absorb nitrates and reduce them to a lower level, so if you can, add some in.

, This can be a slight but important difference between clean, quick cycling and slow, smelly cycling. If you used fish flakes (which is a slow process) to cycle your tank, you only have to clean them out if they clump up and stick to surfaces. If you have chunks of food like shrimp laying around, that will invite non-beneficial bacteria. Only leave big food items in the water for a day and thoroughly clean up all the pieces afterwards., For example: if you see quick conversion from ammonia to nitrite between day 12 and 13, but you are stuck at nitrite to nitrate, that is normal. People can panic over normal, but slow, results, and they tend to forget the water parameter levels from day to day without recording them. Comparing ammonia levels daily will give you a sense of whether or not your tank is cycling. From about day 15 and onward, ammonia levels should be slightly decreasing and nitrites slowly increasing. If you can't see that (with the power of your records), you know you need to improve your environment.

If you are weeks into your cycle and still have not seen ammonia decrease, plus your environment is ideal for bacteria, start your tank over again. Thoroughly clean it without soap or chemicals. You may have had soap or chemicals contaminate your tank.
Sharp increases in nitrates and decreasing nitrites indicate that the cycle is almost done.

But don’t remove the electrical devices yet., Wear rubber, water proof gloves for this. Take out any objects from within the tank. Put them aside on clean paper towels., Do this with an algae sponge. Use deep, kneading like strokes for each inner surface. Make at least two or three passes each on the bottom and sides., Slide the filter out of its position in the tank and set it aside on clean paper towels near a wash basin or sink along with the decorations you removed earlier., Run the filter, decorations, and fake plants under warm water. Rinse off each thoroughly with water to ensure no excess grime remains. Put the objects back on clean paper towels., This is usually a composite material tube with a siphon connected to a faucet or bucket to collect the extracted water. Push the gravel cleaner end into the bottom of the aquarium’s gravel layer until it reaches the bottom. Debris will rise through the siphon with the gravel and water. Once the water starts to clear, you should close the hose’s valve or pinch the hose above the gravel to allow the rocks to fall back down. Pull the gravel cleaner up, and put it back down to an adjacent area to repeat the process.Do this until approximately a quarter or one third of the water has been removed from the tank.

, Measure the temperature reading in the tank. Use a thermometer safe for water. You might ask the pet store for one for aquariums. Use the thermometer to adjust the water out of your tap to match the water temperature already in the tank.This step is more about not stressing the fish with sudden changes. Fish species can vary with the temperature they require, but a normal range to aim for would be 74-82º F (23-28º C).

, You can also manually fill a bucket to restore water levels in the aquarium to normal. Add any chemical treatments, such as de-chlorinator, while the tank is filling. If you’re using the bucket-method, then add the treatments to the water before pouring the water into the tank.

, Put the decorations and fake plants in first. Put these in more or less the same position you had them previously. Slide the filter back into its proper slot., Reconnect the electrical systems of the tank once your hands are removed and thoroughly dry. Turn on the pump.

, Use a screwdriver or similar tool to unfasten the top of the filter, and gain access to the sponge or pad. Remove the sponge or pad and rinse it under warm water for a few minutes. Alternatively, you can use the cleansed water from an aquarium water change session as the rinse water to retain healthy bacteria, and prevent ammonia contamination. If the sponge or pad is too full of debris, then you should purchase a replacement and install it into the filter. Once the original or new sponge/pad are back inside the filter, re-fasten the top and screw it back into place.These filters needed cleaning at least every other week, but may need it more often if you have more fish.

, Chemical filters usually take the form of granules or pellets. The chemical filter is normally placed sequentially after an existing mechanical filter and the water—or between the mechanical filter, and biological filter. Follow the instructions on the product you select, but normally, you will simply pour the instructed amount of granules into the filter, or pre-fabricated filter bag for placing in the tank water directly. A form of activated carbon is typical choice in this case. Activated carbon absorbs organic particles, medications, bacteria causing odors, and colors dissolved into the aquarium water. When the water is becoming cloudy, or smells bad, it is time to change the chemical filter.Usually, these filters are good for 1-2 months. If you use a filter bag, then put the bag in a high water-flow area of the tank.

, The biological filter holds the bacteria that participates in the breakdown of material in the nitrogen cycle. This is a major step in keeping the water clear of ammonia, and nitrates—toxins that are eventually fatal to fish. These filters usually have a large surface area, and are located sequentially after the chemical filter. In other words, the water will filter through the mechanical and chemical filters first. If the biological filter is clogged, then you need to pull the filter, and rinse it only with the aquarium water in order to retain the helpful bacteria and slime on the surface.You should only have to replace the biological filter if it’s physically damaged.

, For any motorized equipment, such as a pump or power filter, you need to follow your manufacturer’s instructions to maintain them properly. However, you can do some basic maintenance to make sure the water stays clean with well-run equipment. Do these power equipment cleanings during water changes while power is off, and disconnected from the tank. Use your instruction manual for removing impeller blades (motor blades) from power filters and pumps. Use a clean dust cloth to wipe debris from the impeller blades, and inspect it for damage. Replace it if damaged.

, With the filter removed during a water change, you can take a few extra steps in maintaining it. Rinse the filter’s main housing, pipes (intake and outlet), and use aquarium safe lubricants for any moving parts. Petroleum jelly or liquid silicone can be useful as lubricants. Externally mounted power pumps may need machine oil, but consult your manual. After cleaning and lubricating the filter, you should put the pieces back together and reinsert the filter in the tank.You may need to prime the filter before it will work again. Fill the filter with some of the aquarium water after insertion back into the tank. This will restart the siphon function.

, Fish only need light feedings once a day, and should skip feedings one or two days per week. Remove uneaten food after 10 minutes., Aquarium salt is essentially ordinary table salt (NaCl) with no additives. Add 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of aquarium salt for every 5 gallons (19 liters) of aquarium water.Ask your veterinarian or pet shop owner if the fish species you own will tolerate aquarium salt.

, This is a chemical product to eliminate chlorine, chloramine, ammonia, and nitrates from cloudy water more directly. This will work in both fresh water, and salt water environments. Instructions will vary with product, but you will pour this directly into the aquarium water at the rate of approximately .01 gallons (50 milliliters) of product for every 50 gallons (189 liters) of aquarium water.Add this during water changes too.

First determine how much lighting you have.,
Next, figure out what plants you would like to grow.,
Substrate is vital for successful plant growth.,
Plants are notorious snail carriers, so when you bring your plants home, check the leaves and stems thoroughly for snails or snail egg cases.

,
Most plants will come in small containers when you buy them.,
Use a pencil or wooden dowel to make a depression in the substrate.,
Do not fertilize your plants during the start up faze (the first 3-4 weeks).,
Enjoy your planted tank!

",How to Plant an Aquarium," Most plants need at least 2 watts per gallon to grow properly. If necessary, upgrade your lighting.;
, Beginners are recommended to start with easy plants that do not need a lot of light and do not require CO2. Here is a list of some very basic plants:

Water wisteria






Java moss






Anubias






Cryptocoryne wendtii






Amazon Sword







, Plants can be grown in normal gravel, but your choices will be limited, as most plants do much better in a sand substrate. Whatever you choose, make sure you layer at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) thick and it is advisable to put a 1 inch (2.5 cm) layer of eco complete or a similar plant substrate underneath. This will provide nutrients for the plants.

,, Gently remove the plant from the container and use a toothpick to untangle the roots if the plant has become root bound.

, Gently place the plant in the depression and cover its roots with substrate. Some plants will die if you accidentally cover the crown of the plant with substrate, so be careful.

, After that, you can start fertilizing with a liquid or tablet fertilizer. Make sure you choose one that contains essential micro nutrients like iron. If you are on well water, the water will contain many of these micro-nutrients already.

Cycle the tank for at least a month before you put any fish in.",How to Set up an Aquarium With Live Plants," It must be able to support the weight of the aquarium. Each gallon weighs about 8 lbs, so a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank with gravel and decor will be almost 100 lbs. Do not put the tank in direct sunlight, also don't place the tank where there is a lot of activity and the tank might get bumped or jiggled. This can put the fish or plants inside in danger!;
,, Layer it at least 1.5 thick.

, Do not use course gravel as this will make it hard for the plants roots to become established in the substrate.

, Only fill it about 1/4 to 1/3 full of water. Try to keep the water between 70–80 °F (21–27 °C). Very cold or very hot water will shock the plants and possibly kill them.

, If they are root bound use a toothpick to gently pull apart the roots and untangle them.

, Keep in mind positioning of the plant. Taller plants should be rooted in the background, and shorter plants should be rooted in the foreground. Do not place the plants too near the filter or the heater, because this will not be good for the plants.

, Some plants will die if you cover the crown of the plant so keep this in mind when planting.

, Again, keep the water temperature between 70–80 °F (21–27 °C).

,,, The tank needs time to build up beneficial bacteria in the gravel and the filter pad. This beneficial bacteria stabilizes the tank and prevents ammonia and nitrate swings which are harmful to fish. Add onion or bumblebee snails to keep the algae level down. You can also use Flying Foxes or Otto Cats instead. Lighting should be given in accordance to the plants that you have.

",How to Grow Freshwater Aquarium Plants," It pays to do a bit of reading at this point, so check out aquarium forums and other sources of information. Consider the tank size, the scene you wish to produce and the size you want your plant(s) to be. Remember, plants grow! Want something with lots of leaves, or more of a moss? How about something your fish will be able to eat?


You can find tiny, dwarf aquarium plants that grow only an inch or two tall, or obtain much larger plants for larger tanks.;
, Either get an inexpensive, small cutting and wait for it to grow larger or purchase a more costly, larger plant. Plants can be obtained at local pet shops, or a hobby specialist online can provide you with cuttings,usually for a small cost. Either way, be careful of what you introduce to your tank. Plants can carry physical inhabitants from snails and shrimp to bacteria and diseases. Always look for a source that seems to practice good tank hygiene.

, Some of the tiniest water snails, no more than a couple of millimeters long, are rapid breeders. Unless you have loaches or other fish that will snack on them, they'll quickly take over your tank. You may quarantine a new plant outside your tank for a few days, to see if any snails appear.

, If your tank is not quite ready or if you want to grow more of your plants than will fit in a tank, use a bucket or bin of water.

, Depending on the plant, this may be mostly an aesthetic matter, to keep them from bobbing around loose. For mosses, consider tying them loosely with string to a rock until they become established.


In general, do not bury the rhizomes, which usually are thicker and greener than roots or stem, in gravel, as burying them can cause the whole plant to quickly die, also try not to bury the crown just above the roots on other plants that need to be in the substrate .

, Aquarium plants, like any others, require light for photosynthesis. Check the light requirements of the plants you are choosing, many require high amounts of added light. Low light plants will do well if your tank has plenty of light from windows. Otherwise, plan to light your tank with a fluorescent full spectrum tank light.


It's recommended that when you start out, stick to less than 2.5 fluorescent watts per gallon unless you put a carbon dioxide system in place.
""Cool White"" or ""Daylight"" fluorescent bulbs are cheap, efficient, and effective enough for most purposes.

, While not strictly required, fish waste will help to nourish the plants. The plants, in turn, will keep the water conditions better for the fish by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen during the daytime, at night the plants of course give off CO2. Some plants are good at removing ammonia or nitrites. If you don't have fish already, wait a week after adding the plants before you introduce them to the lush environment you're creating.

, Plants do not need water changes the same way that fish do, but it is still a good idea to change the plant water when changing your fish water. Do not siphon in your plant bed, as you may kill and injure them. Run your siphon over the top of the soil in which the plants are planted, and make sure you don't damage them.

, Algae growing on tank walls or on plant leaves competes with plants for light. You can remove algae manually by scrubbing or scraping the walls of your tank weekly when changing the water and rubbing the plant's leaves gently between your fingers. The far easier method, though, is to let your tank's inhabitants do the job for you. Shrimp and several catfish eagerly feed on algae and can help to keep your tank far cleaner with little or no effort on your part.

, Depending on your tank and your plants, you may find you have too much plant soon. Choosing slow-growing plants can help keep them small, but it can also mean having less plant and waiting longer for your plants to fill out. Find the right balance for your tank.

Plant your aquatic plant in a container before putting it in water.,
Grow tropical and subtropical water plants like Cannas (Canna spp) in a container.,
Do not use a container with drain holes.,
Use plastic pots without holes, or fabric pots.,
Select a container based on how large you want the aquatic pot to grow.,
Ask a sales associate at an aquatic plant nursery if you are not sure what size container you should use.,
Use loamy clay for aquatic plants.,
Buy commercially manufactured aquatic plant potting mix if the native soil is sandy or very heavy clay.,
Do not use potting soil that is formulated for regular, terrestrial potted plants.,
If you are planting a rhizome, pour moistened soil into the container until it is ⅓ full.,
Add more damp soil.,
If you’re growing a hardy water lily rhizome, place it at an angle and to one side of the container.,
Place additional damp soil into the container over the rhizome.,
If you’re growing tropical water lily and lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) rhizomes, center them in the pot.,
If you’re growing Cannas, plant them in the center of the container.,
For other types of aquatic plants with roots instead of rhizomes, fill the container with ⅔ to ¾ damp soil.,
Add ½ to ¾ inch of pea gravel over the top of the soil for all aquatic plants.,
Water the aquatic plant right after planting.,
Plant the aquatic plants in the spring or early summer in a water feature that gets at least six hours of sunlight each day.,
Plant aquatic plants hardy enough to survive cooler temperatures in water that is 50 °F (10 °C).,
Plant tropical and subtropical aquatics in water that is over 70 °F (21 °C).,
Place them in a spot where there is no more than 6 to 8 inches of water above the pot.,
If the pond gets only six hours of sunlight each day, place them at a depth of 6 inches.,
Do not lift the plant by its stems.,
Keep the container as level as possible when moving it.",How to Plant Aquatic Plants," Planting it in a container controls its spreading, which many aquatic plants do very quickly.


Some aquatic plants can completely take over a smaller water feature within a few years and have to be controlled with chemicals or pulled out by hand.;
, These plantsgrow well in USDA Hardiness Zones 7 to 10. But they will not survive temperatures below 0 °F (−18 °C).If planted in a pond, these plants must be taken out in the fall and stored in a cool, dry area where they will not be exposed to frost during the winter.

, Unlike terrestrial plants that should be planted in containers with drain holes, aquatic plants do not need a container with holes as the potting soil can wash out through the holes.

, Fabric pots are ideal for aquatic plants. The fabric allows water to soak into the potting soil but keeps the soil in and the flexible fabric on the bottom makes it easier to keep the plant level.Fabric pots are a bit more expensive than plastic pots, though, and harder to move when the plant is taken out of the water.

, Smaller containers keep plants smaller while larger containers let them grow larger. Certain species of aquatic plants also grow better in smaller or larger containers


Hardy water lilies like the “Comanche” (Nymphaea “Comanche”),which grow well in Zones 4 to 10, and Cannas should be planted in containers that are 10 inches deep and 15 inches wide.Tropical water lilies like the “Director George T. Moore” (Nymphaea “Director George T. Moore”)which only grow well in Zones 10 and 11, should be planted in containers that are 10 inches deep and 20 inches wide.
Smaller plants like the “Katie Ruellia” (Ruellia brittonia “Katie”), which grows to 5 to 10 inches tall and grows well in Zones 9 to 11, can be planted in a 5-inch deep, 8-inch wide pot to keep it them smaller or a 5-inch deep, 12-inch wide pot to let it grow a little larger., They will be able to tell you which size pot will work best for each plant.

, If the soil in your yard is naturally loamy clay, it can be used for the aquatic plants., You can use a brand like PondCare Aquatic Planting Media.This mix contains kiln-fired clay pieces, provides plant nutrients and anchors the aquatic plant securely in its container.
While sandy soil may keep the plant anchored, it will not hold enough nutrients to keep aquatic plants healthy.

, It is too light and will leach into the water.

, Then, put two to four aquatic plant fertilizer tablets on the soil spaced evenly around the container 2 to 3 inches in from the edge.


The number of tablets required varies, depending on the size of the tablets and the size of the container.
There should be 1 to 2 ounces of fertilizer for each gallon of soil.Fertilizer tablets with a 12-8-8, 10-6-4, 20-10-5 or 5-10-5 ratio are fine., Do this until the container is ⅔ full.

, These rhizomes are actually thickened stems that resemble sweet potatoes.


The growing end of the rhizome with growth buds or “eyes” should be placed at the center of the container with the “eyes” facing up and buried deeper than the other end so that the whole thing is sitting at a 45 degree angle.
The growth buds or “eyes” look very similar to the “eyes” on a potato.
This placement gives the hardy water lily room to grow in the pot.

, The higher end should be just above soil level and the lower end should be covered.

, Their “eyes” should be facing up and the top of the rhizome should be above soil level.Lotuses grow well in Zones 4 to 10.

, Then, cover them with 2 to 3 inches of soil., Then, hold the plant in the center of the container and add more damp soil until the roots are covered.

, This will help to keep the soil in the container and keep fish from displacing the soil.

, The soil should be wet.

, Aquatic plants that get only four hours of sunlight or less will grow very slowly or may not grow at all.

, Aquatic plants such as hardy water lilies and lotus do well in these conditions.

, Cannas and tropical water lilies will do well in these conditions., This will then allow sunlight to easily reach them. Bricks or overturned clay pots can be placed beneath the aquatic plant container to raise it up if the water is too deep.


Deeper water will not let the sunlight reach the plant rhizomes or roots to trigger new stem growth.
Hardy water lilies grow best with 1 to 1 ½ feet of water covering the container.
Tropical water lilies do fine with 6 to 12 inches of water over the container but lotus grow in 4 to 6 inches of water.Cannas grow well up above the water.They should be placed so that the top of the container is 6 to 8 inches deep.

, Adjust this to 6 to 8 inches if the pond gets more than six hours of sunlight.


Lotus should be submerged to a depth of only 2 inches until they begin to grow.
After the aquatic plants reach 4 to 6 inches tall, they can be moved into deeper water.

, They will break. Instead, lift the container by grasping it at the top with one hand on either side to hold it level or grasp it at the top on one side, tilt it just enough to get a hand underneath and move it with one hand on the bottom and one hand at the top of the container.

, This will keep the gravel from spilling over the side of the container.

Get an Aqueon water changer/siphon.,
Install the siphon by unscrewing the compression nut and slide onto one end of the flexible hose, firmly slide the flexible hose as far as possible over the barbs on the faucet valve, slide the compression nut back up and screw it on.

,
In a similar fashion, unscrew the compression nut in the intake tube and slide it on to the remaining tube in the flexible hose, firmly slide the flexible hose as far as possible and tighten.

,
Typically, you will need to remove an aerator nozzle from the faucet before attaching the water changer.

,
Use the adapter provided and attach it to the faucet.

,
With the adapter in place, tighten the faucet valve to the sink.

,
Turn off the heater and filter and remove any obstructions.

,
Place the intake tube into the aquarium.

,
Make sure the two blue valve levelers are open and in the up and down position.

,
Turn on the water.,
When you have completed pulling water from your aquarium, pull the intake tube out of the aquarium keeping the blue valve level in the open position, place the intake tube into the sink and place the blue valve level in the faucet valve to the closed position.

,
The water should now run out of the intake tube, let the water continue to run to remove all dirty aquarium water, use this time to adjust the temperature flowing out of the intake tube.

,
When the aquarium water has been removed from the hose and the temperature adjusted, turn the blue leveler in the faucet valve back to the open position and take the intake tube back to the aquarium.

,
Turn the blue faucet level to the closed position and water should begin flowing down.

,
While waiting for the water to flow, add the correct amount of Aqueon water conditioner.

,
When the aquarium is full, turn of the faucet.

,
Remove the intake tube from the aquarium and into the sink, roll the hose and disconnect the faucet valve for future use.

If your tank is tall but has a small water surface area, don’t put many floating plants. If your tank is wide but shallow, short rooted and floating plants are best. The trick is to accommodate plants that can grow to their full potential; you don’t want a foot-tall plant growing in a shallow tank!

The water capacity is not usually considered for plants, as they do not swim around or create that much waste.
Make sure your filter can process the amount of water there as well, if your tank is tall, wide or deep.;
, Do you have goldfish, plecos, or other creatures that love eating vegetation? Many standard freshwater fish or invertebrates are plant-friendly, but some aren’t. Curious fish love pecking plants as well, so try sturdy plants such as:Marimo moss balls
Amazon sword
Java fern
Anubias

, Many people plant directly onto the substrate, which is usually gravel. Sand is beautiful, but many plants aren’t compatible, so it’s not always ideal. Generally, try for rooted plants where the majority will be for gravel. If you wish to use pellet fertilizer in the future, gravel is the best. If you have sand or no substrate, floating plants, moss balls, and anchoring plants will work.

Anchoring plants include mosses and other ground-creepers.
Most small to medium gravel sizes are compatible. However, large pebble-like gravel can be hard for plants to root in.

, Generally 2 to 5 wattage per gallon is good.Standard fluorescent and LED is okay for beginner plants, which don’t need much light. Other types of fluorescent bulbs are better. Your lights should come with a label detailing type of bulb and wattage; check this.

LED lights are sensitive to moisture, so use a glass cover.
Incandescent bulbs are not recommended because they produce a lot of heat and are not energy-efficient at lighting.

, This is to see how efficient your tank is at processing waste. Putting in a pinch of fish flakes works, but using pure ammonia sold as cleaner is quicker. Calculators are available online to check how much ammonia you should be putting in your tank; 3 ppm of ammonia is the best concentration to aim for.

Never add much ammonia to a tank that already has animals. Adding ammonia to a tank with animals can poison them, so be careful to only add it if it is needed.
If your tank has at least 50% of its fish capacity, skip this step. There’s a steady source of natural ammonia already!
Search for “ammonia concentration calculator” for calculating how much ammonia to add.
If you do use cleaning ammonia, make sure it is pure, isn’t scented, colored, and doesn't have any additives besides water.

, In this period of time, don’t add any more ammonia. Test for the big three: ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate. While test tube-style tests can take a long time, they provide more accurate results than test strips.

Adding ammonia without testing at this stage might stall your system.
Some pet stores will test your water as a customer service for free, so ask the employees what tests they offer.

, If your ammonia, nitrites, or both are still present after this testing time period, it just means you need to let the system naturally cycle for a bit. If your ammonia and nitrites are 0, and nitrates are present, congratulations! Your tank is cycling well., If your tank isn’t up to par, cycle it until ammonia can be quickly neutralized into nitrates. If your tank's ammonia tested fine, you may still need to do a 25% water change to reduce nitrate levels over 20 ppm -- using properly conditioned water.

Adding invertebrates like shrimp can help with clearing up dead matter, which in turn means less ammonia for you to worry about.

, These sections are the foreground, middle, background, and the less acknowledged water surface. If you imagine slicing your tank lengthwise into three sections, those are the first three sections mentioned. The foreground is the closest section to a viewer. The background is the section farthest from the viewer. The middle is sandwiched between the two. The surface of the water is included because floating plants are commonly used, and do take up their own space., The background does well with thick, long growth, sort of like a curtain backdrop. The middle is usually reserved for wood and rocks, where a variety of medium sized plants can be anchored. Since the foreground is the closest to the viewer, delicate and small plants are favored here. Any type of floating plant is good for the surface, it's just up to your own preference.

Foreground plants include:Anubias
Dwarf hairgrass
Any carpeting plants


Middle distance plants include:

Java fern
Java moss
Dwarf ferns


Background plants include:Amazon sword
Water sprite
Crypts


Surface plants include:

Duckweed
Bladderwort
Water lettuce



, If you want competitive, fast-growing floating plants, those can block light to lower plants, such as moss. Bushy, tall plants also block light in their shade. Picking plants that conflict, such as fast growers that have the potential to block out light to overshadowed plants is not a good idea. Each plant also has different light and fertilizer requirements; just make sure every plant and its place in the tank matches each other's needs to prevent such conflicts.

If you’re sure you can keep up, you can just prune or transplant the fast growing plants regularly to ensure enough light reaches all levels of your water.
Spacing out plants that block out light is another option to control them.
”Beginner” plants (ferns, moss, swords) usually have the same comfort zone, so consider these if you want multiple plant species co-existing together.

, Most animals aren’t picky, but some love shade or protection. Livebearers, which include guppies and mollies, especially need thick protection for fry to hide among. Egg layers would also benefit from their kind of place to nest. Generally, small animals would benefit from cover and concealment.

Plants also provide a source of food for some animals.
Mix floating and bushy plants to provide cover so fry don't stand-out as well lighted ""food"" in open areas.

, This especially pertains to ones kept in containers, which are the most popular. Oftentimes, plants are shipped and sold in sealed containers. While these containers often contain a watery gel for nutrients, the plant inside can exhaust this over time. If the plant has been in the store for over half a year, skip it.

If the plants you’re interested in are kept in tanks, this freshness step can be skipped.

, If it’s in a sealed container, check if there is water condensation on the upper part of the container, and see what source of nutrients is available. Such water condensation means the plant is not dehydrated. And, vital nutrients can be in the form of gel or small fertilizer pellets. If the plants are in tanks, check whether there are dead animals or plants inside. Dead organisms indicate a lack of proper, consistent water care, so skip plants from these tanks.

If you see small stray snails crawling near the plant, this is also not a good sign. Their tiny offspring can transfer from your new plant to your tank.

, A little is acceptable and normal; a lot is not good. If more than 25% of the plant exhibits these signs, skip buying it. The signs of deterioration include:Brown or black coloration of any part
Slimy film present
Shredded-looking (note that some plants are naturally like this)
Holes in the leaves

, While there are plant-friendly snails sold in pet stores all over, the snails or their eggs hitchhiking in plants are not your friends. They are often small and dark, which makes them difficult to pick them out. When introduced to a nice, warm tank, they can reproduce quickly. Even if you don’t see snails themselves on the plants, eggs may be present. If you want to keep your plants intact and hole-free, this step is important, realizingSome snails, especially the plant-harming ones, can reproduce by themselves and don’t need a mate.
To make sure your plants are snail-free, soak them for about 2 minutes in a chlorine bath of 1 gallon of water mixed with 1 1/2 cup household bleach. Name brands of bleach are sold at about 5.0% chlorine; so you're diluting that to 1/10 strength, 10% household chlorine bleach and 90% water for 0.5% = 1/2% chlorine. The plants best suited for this treatment are tougher, larger-leaved ones. Smaller plants should be soaked not more than 1 minute.Then dip them in a dechlor solution and rinse them thoroughly with tap water. Repeat rinsing if the plants smell of chlorine. The plants best suited for this treatment are tougher, larger-leaved ones. Smaller plants should be soaked not more than 1 minute.

Since goldfish prefer to be in groups, the minimum tank size should be 30 gallons (113.6 L).;
, It is advised to buy a longer and wider aquarium than a taller one since the goldfish will have more room to swim back and forth and there is more surface area for gas exchange. This is important because fish need dissolved oxygen in the water to respire. Although quality is more of a guarantee when buying an aquarium at a pet store, it will be much less expensive to buy an aquarium online from ebay or a similar website. Be warned that aquariums from either source may have leaks. Fill the tank outdoors with tap water to check for leaks before proceeding.


Glass aquariums are more limited in shape (almost always rectangular, some bowfront). They will not scratch easily but are more likely to break catastrophically.
Acrylic aquariums are more versatile in shape but scratch easily. Do not use magnetic algae scrubbers on these tanks; use only a cloth. They are less likely to break but much more expensive than glass tanks.

, The minimum 30 gallon (113.6 L) aquarium is going to weigh over 240 lbs when full, so most tables will not support your aquarium. Metal stands tend to be cheaper than wooden stands. Some people make their own stands. Online DIY instructions are plentiful, but unadvised for someone unfamiliar with woodworking.

, Some people do not want a substrate in their goldfish tanks at all and prefer to use only pots so that the tank may be cleaned easier. In this case, use clean terra cotta plant pots. The substrate in these will be identical to what can be used to cover the entire bottom of the aquarium. The different kinds if substrate are:


Inert gravel: Very inexpensive, should not become anaerobic, easy maintenance, does not support a wide variety of plants (can be somewhat remedied by adding fertilizers). Larger pea-gravel is not a good idea because it may become lodged in the goldfish's mouth. Always use small, fine gravel.
Inert sand: Inexpensive, may become anaerobic (more likely in fine sand), moderate maintenance (cause by not being able to vacuum throughout the sand, having sand stirred up into filter), does not support a wide variety of plants (can be somewhat remedied by adding fertilizers).
Enriched substrate: Expensive, should not become anaerobic, easy maintenance, supports a wide variety of plants.
Dirt covered with sand: Inexpensive, will almost definitely have some anaerobic problems during the first few months, difficult maintenance (at first, but it becomes easy maintenance after a few months), supports a wide variety of plants.

, The types of filter are:


""Hang on back"" power filter: inexpensive to moderate (depends on quality, usually found $30-$70), can handle tanks up to about 80 gallons (302.8 L), variable noise (can be loud or quiet depending on quality and water level, but never silent because of water splashing back into the aquarium)
Canister filter: much more expensive ($80-$200), can handle much larger tanks, often silent
Sponge filter: very inexpensive or free (can be made DIY), only used as a supplemental filter
Undergravel filters: not compatible with plants or (obviously) tanks without gravel.

, As a beginner, you'll want to have low to medium lights. However, the hoods sold with aquariums usually do not have enough lights in them to sustain plant life beyond a few select species such as anubias, java fern, java moss, and some cryptocoryne. Low to medium light is approximately 1 to 2 watts per gallon of water in tank of at least 30 gallons (113.6 L). Usually, two T8 fluorescent strips spanning the length of the aquarium is sufficient for this. Shoplights are an inexpensive option for this and can be found at most hardware stores such as Menard's and Home Depot for less than $20. More expensive light fixtures made specifically for aquariums can be found in specialty stores or bought online.

, Try to determine before buying whether they are compatible with your lighting and substrate choices. Avoid fragile looking plants that may be eaten by goldfish. Do not buy plants that are not true aquatic plants. Get some tall plants, medium and ""groundcover"" plants for the back, center, and front of your tank. If you want to buy driftwood, let it soak for a few weeks before adding it to your tank so it doesn't stain your aquarium with the tannins in the wood. Check your plants for snails and snail eggs (clear, jelly like drops on the leaves) if you don't want them in your tank. Snails are usually benign but may reproduce quickly, covering the tank in spots. Accessories such as bubble stones, UV sterilizers, and thermometers are helpful but unnecessary. Heaters are not needed for goldfish because goldfish can survive many different temperatures. Some heaters have also been known to explode in the tank, breaking glass and killing inhabitants.

, Put the stand in somewhere away from direct sunlight and drafts. Put the tank on top. Rinse your substrate unless the directions say otherwise. If you have dirt, make sure there is no air pockets left. Add the substrate to the tank about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) thick or 1.5–2.5 inches (3.8–6.4 cm) of dirt capped with 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) of sand. Fill your tank with water and add aquarium water dechlorinator to it. Plant your plants in the substrate or tie them to the wood/rocks if they grow on a rhizome (such as anubias and java fern) or if they are mosses. Put the filter in place and start it. Set the tank lid and lights on top and turn on the lights.

, Buy some water parameter (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and optionally pH) testing strips or drops from a pet store. Buy some pure ammonia (no additives such as surfactants for cleaning) from a hardware store. Add enough ammonia so that the drops or strips read 5ppm ammonia. In a non planted tank, one would usually see an initial spike of ammonia, then nitrite, and then nitrates. At this point any ammonia added would quickly be converted in nitrates. Nitrates are the only ""safe"" compound of the three. It is still deadly to fish in large amounts and causes irritation in medium amounts, but is not of primary concern compared to the other two. In a planted tank, the presence of plants converting ammonia into nitrates and nitrates into plant material can distort the usual nitrogen cycle. The pH of your tank should be between 6.5 and 8. Do not try to adjust the pH with baking soda or other materials with very high or low pH. Fish can more easily adjust to a suboptimal but steady pH than a changing pH. Buffers such as crushed coral are a safer option for keeping pH slightly higher and very steady. A handful can be sprinkled on the substrate.

, In a regular aquarium, the usual end of the cycling process is shown by no ammonia or nitrites and steady nitrates. In a planted aquarium, the completion of the cycle of shown when 1ppm ammonia can be added and the readings turn to 0 ammonia within a day or two. This process should complete within 4 to 6 weeks. On the day you add your fish, do a 25% water change with fresh, dechlorinated water.

, Go to a reputable chain, local, or online shop. Don't buy more than two per week to give your bacteria cycle some time to multiply and account for the increase in ammonia production. Look for fish with no spots, bloating, ragged fins, strange growth, or fuzzy growths. There should be no dead or ill fish in the tank.

, (Finally, right?) Float the goldfish bag in the tank for 10 minutes so that the water temperature will be about the same. During this time you can add some tank water to the bag to acclimate the fish to the water parameters. Then get a bucket and pour the fish out of the bag into a net over the bucket so that the pet store water does not get into your aquarium. This is done so that any waterborne parasites and diseases have less of a chance of infecting the inhabitants of your tank. Then place the fish in the tank. If the fish are especially stressed (such as sitting to the bottom of the tank and clamping their fins- behavior hopefully not seen at the pet store), turn off the lights and don't feed the fish until the next day.

, Feed your fish good flake or pellet food with 30-40% protein. Regular tropical fish flakes have a higher amount of protein, but goldfish need less protein because they are omnivorous rather than carnivorous like most tropical fish. Feed them once or twice a day and add treats such as bloodworms, vegetables, and fruits to their diet. This is unnecessary, but very enjoyable to both the fish and the owner. Goldfish with buoyancy problems should be fed sinking pellets or flakes that have been put underwater. Peas can also help with digestive issues.

, In a new aquarium, the water parameters should be tested regularly and water changed 25% weekly or whenever there are above 0.5ppm ammonia or nitrite readings. After a few months, things should be settled and water changes can be reduced to 25% every two or three weeks. The gravel does not need to be vacuumed deeply to avoid disturbing the root systems of plants. Fine gravel, sand, and dirt should be poked regularly with a skewer to prevent stagnant areas, especially in the first few months. Never remove all of the filter media at once. Fertilizers can be added, but are unnecessary and may result in algae blooms in used incorrectly.

,


Trim stem plants (ex: anacharis, rotala, ludwigia, bacopa) by cutting the stem and replanting the top portion. The bottom portion will grow one or more new stems from the side but the cut part will not grow.
Rosette plants (ex: swords, sagittaria, vallisneria) cannot be trimmed, or the leaf will brown and die. They will send off runners with plantlets.
Mosses can be trimmed and both pieces will grow.
Rhizome plants (ex: anubias, java fern) can be cut on the rhizome so as to end up with two pieces of rhizome with leaves attached to either. A leaf cannot grow if it is not attached to the rhizome.

Choose your pH tester.,
Open your tester and inspect the contents.,
Determine the desired pH of your aquarium.,
Try out your digital tester, if that’s the test method you chose.,
Use your chemical test, if you bought one.,
Test your aquarium and test often.,
Prevent your pH from leaving your desired range.",How to Test pH in a Fish Tank," Most large box stores and pet stores have at least a small selection of pH testers available. Try to choose the store or website with the largest selection possible. This way, you’ll be able to browse through a number of different brands and find the tester that is best for you. Consider these factors:


Price. If you’re short on cash, you might consider an inexpensive option. Kit prices will range from $5 to $100 or more.
Quality. Some brands are better than others, and will give you a more accurate reading of your pH. Consider this before purchasing.
Number of uses you will get from the kit. You’ll probably be testing your tank often, so consider this along with price and quality before you purchase.;
, Test kits are designed to provide specific read outs on a certain range of pH. You might need one or both depending on what kind of fish you have.


Most freshwater tanks should have a pH of between 6.5 and 7.5.
Most saltwater tanks should have a pH higher than 8.0.
Low range kits max out at a reading of 7.6. If you are testing with a low range kit, and get a reading of 7.6, your actual pH might be higher.
High range kits will measure from 7.6 up to 8.8.
Consider buying both so you can have an accurate reading., There are a lot of different pH tests and kits available for the consumer. There are, though, two main kinds of pH testers. You choice will depend on price, experience, and your level of commitment to your aquarium.


Digital tester. With the digital tester, you calibrate it using a supplied solution, and then dip it in your tank to get the reading. Digital testers give very precise readings and are sometimes more reliable (if you calibrate properly). They are also more expensive ($60 to $100), but might save you in the long run.
Chemical tester. This kit requires that you take a sample of the water and test it with chemicals supplied in the kit. You then dip a strip in the sample, and the strip turns a color. Afterwards, you compare the strip to a supplied color chart. These kits are multi-use and are less expensive ($10 to $30). Keep in mind that they are sometimes less reliable and less precise.
You might also be able to find a strip chemical test in which you dip litmus paper or a special strip into the water and then compare it to a color chart.
You can also use both chemical testers and digital testers to double check yourself and make sure you are getting an accurate result. This is the best solution if you have invested a lot of money in your aquarium., You need to familiarize yourself with your pH tester before you use it. Open the kit, take stock of the items, and read the directions.


Chemical testers will include a color card, little glass test tube, and a bottle with pH test solution.
Strip chemical tests will include strips and a color card.
Digital testers will include the digital meter and packets of calibration solution.
Digital testers might not come with batteries.

, There is no normal pH for all fish. Different fish thrive in different environments. But there are some important ranges you need to consider.


Saltwater fish thrive with a pH of 8.0 to 8.3.
Many tropical fish will do fine from 6.5 to 7.5.
Freshwater fish do well between 5.5 and 7.5.
Depending on the fish, having a pH out of these ranges will be extremely dangerous and will threaten the life of your fish. Talk to the person at your local pet store about desired pHs for specific fish.
Keep in mind that pH is not static. The pH of your tank will change over time and over the course of a single day.
pH levels below 6 indicates the possibility that your tank might soon become a dangerous and toxic environment for your fish., Digital testers are fairly easy to use. After you’ve calibrated them, it should be no work at all – you will just stick the tip of the tester in the water and take your reading. Here are the steps to calibrate and then test your tank:


Power up your tester and make sure it works.
Pour the calibration liquid that comes with the tester in a glass bowl.
Stick the tip of the tester in the calibration liquid and wait the specified amount of time per your directions.
See your reading.
Rinse the tester.
Apply tester to your aquarium to see pH level.

, The chemical test might seem complicated, but if you follow directions it should only take you a few minutes. Once you’ve done it a few times, it will be no trouble at all, and it might even be fun.


Take out your little glass test tube, color card, and pH test solution.
Dip the test tube in the tank and fill it up to the 5ml line.
Grab your pH test solution, and carefully squirt 3 drops (or follow your directions) into the test tube with the water in it.
Put the little snap tight lid on the tube, and shake it for 1-3 minutes straight.
After shaking the tube, get out your color card and under a bright light, compare the color of your water to the colors on the card. Each color will represent a pH level.
If you have a strip test, simply dip the strip in the water, wait a minute, and compare it to a color card. Each color will represent a pH level., If you test often, you’ll know if the water is safe for your fish and plants.


Test twice a week. This is the best way to monitor the pH level of your water.
Test twice a day if you have recently done a water change. This way, you’ll know if all the steps you’ve taken to achieve a certain pH level are actually working.
Test after you’ve introduced anything new into the tank. Sometimes new plants, rocks, and other items will change the pH level of your water. Also, if you’ve added a substantial amount of new fish, check your pH., Maintenance and prevention are two of the most important things when it comes to achieving your desired pH level. There are certain things you should do take into consideration:


Add new water on a regular basis. New water will help maintain acceptable pH levels.
Never replace your water entirely. This will upset the balance between chemicals, bacteria, and pH that you’ve been working to achieve.
Aerate your water to maintain healthy levels of oxygen. This will help keep your desired pH.
Add solutions and other conditioners in order to maintain a healthy pH level for your fish.
Remove dead fish or plants to avoid bacteria accumulation, or an increase in ammonia or nitrate levels. This will all lead to an unhealthy pH level."

Scoop out debris with a net.,
Wipe down the glass.,
Soak up oily films with a paper towel.",How to Skim Surface Scum from Your Fish Tank1," Old fish food, waste, algae, and other debris can collect on the surface of the water. Using an aquarium net, gently scoop up waste from the surface of the water. Do this slowly so that you do not disturb your fish. Empty the net into a trashcan between each scoop.


While you can use a net to clear debris floating in the water, you should be careful when scooping along the bottom of your tank. If you scrape the gravel, you could release more dust and debris into the water.;
, The glass of your fish tank may become dirty over time from debris, algae, or dirty water. Cleaning the glass weekly will prevent more scum from gathering in your tank. First, drain a few inches of water with a siphon so that you do not spill water during cleaning.Using a tank scraper or a sponge, reach down into the tank, and wipe off the debris from the glass. You may need to clean your tool between wipes to ensure that more debris does not enter the water.


If you have an acrylic tank, you should use a sponge marked as safe for acrylic. , If you notice a milky or oily film on top of the water, you have protein build-up in your tank. This is normal, but you will not be able to remove it with a net. Instead, take a single piece of a paper towel. Lay it on the surface of the water until it is soaked through. Remove the paper towel. The protein will come off with the towel. Repeat with fresh towels until the surface is clear."

Get your supplies.,
Partially drain the water and clean the gravel.,
Replace the water you took out.,
Put in your water conditioner.",How to Use a Fish Gravel Vacuum for Partial Water Changes for Guppies," To clean the gravel in your fish tank, you'll need a few supplies. For bigger tanks, you'll need a siphon/vacuum with a tube attached to the end (they should come like this), stress coat or a similar water conditioner, and a bucket to take out the water and put more in.
, Insert the siphon into the water and start draining out the water into your bucket, making sure to disturb the gravel to loosen up any fish waste or debris.

Try to suck up as much as you can, but don't drain more than 25% of the water for a small change, or 50% of the water for a large change. There will probably be some waste that you don't get and that's okay! If it's floating in the water, your filter will probably get it.

, Discard the old water and fill up your fish tank again with fresh, clean water. Be sure that the water you put in is a similar temperature to the one you took out, or it could send your fish into shock., Put the proper amount of water conditioner in your tank. Water conditioner is a necessity for fish tanks, since it removes the harmful chlorine and other things in your tap water, making it safe for your fish. Unconditioned water could damage their gills and ultimately result in the death of your fish. Read the back of the label for the recommended dose of conditioner per gallon. Don't worry if you get a little extra conditioner in the tank; it won't hurt your fish!"

, For every 30 inches (760 mm) of fish no bigger than 7 inches (180 mm) you will need one 5 gallon (20 L) bucket. If this is not available, use anything that won't be too small or have harmful residue in it.


Soaps and detergents are especially harmful to fish. If you must use a detergent bucket, rinse it very well first.

, Cover the buckets, so fish won't get out and cats, dogs, etc. won't get in.

, Remove gravel, plants, decor, and water. Then take the tank off the stand.

, Don't be too long on your trip. There's no reason you can't purchase the new tank before you start this exchange.

, Place the new tank in the old location. Then, add the Decor, gravel, heater, filter, light, old water, fish, plants, and everything from the old tank. Plug everything in and top off the tank.


If you have lost a lot of water, you may want to top up the missing quantity somewhat gradually, over a period of hours or even days, provided the fish have enough volume in which to live meanwhile.
Treat the replacement water as usual before adding it, including neutralizing chlorine or chloramine, adjusting the pH if you normally do, and adding any salts if your aquarium needs them.

Know what leaks cannot be repaired at home.",How to Repair a Leaky Aquarium," Drain the water low enough to allow room to clean and dry the area around the leak. You can use a cup, bucket, or other container to remove the water. If the leak is at the bottom of the aquarium, you will need to remove all water and aquarium rocks from the tank.If the leak is very low in the tank, you may have to move the fish and aquatic plants into a temporary container or other aquarium while repairs are made.
Keep in mind that the sealant you seal the leak with will have to cure before refilling the tank, so plan accordingly to keep your fish and plants healthy.;
, Scrape away the old sealant around the leaking area with a razor blade scraper. You want to make sure to remove silicone from the leaking area but you don't want to remove the silicone from between the glass panes. The means that you are just removing the silicone bead on the inside corner of the tank.If you didn't drain the entire aquarium because the leak in high up on the walls of the aquarium, be careful not to allow any of the old sealant to drop in the tank.
Silicone sometimes does not bond well with old silicone. You may end up having to remove a lot of the silicone on the inside of the tank and then resealing all the seams at one time. If you are already draining, drying, and scraping silicone, you might as well do the whole thing.

, Wipe the area with a clean cloth dampened with acetone. This will remove any residue and other foreign material from the leak area. Dry with a paper towel and allow to completely air dry, which usually takes about 15 minutes.Having a clean area will assure that the new silicone that you apply will hold to the glass and you will not end up with another leak in the near future.

, Run a bead of silicone along the leak area using a caulking gun. Then smooth that bead out, with a damp finger or a caulking tool, so that the silicone is smoothed out and it completely covers the seam that leaked.Check with a professional aquarium supply for recommended repair products. Make sure that if you use silicone, it is labeled ""nontoxic"" and ""100% silicone"". Also make sure that the silicone sealant has NO fungicide in it and is a High Modulus product.
You may be tempted to try and repair the leak from the outside of the tank, but usually the repair is more effective if made on the inside. A repair on the inside will hold better, since water pressure will ""tighten"" the seal pressing the silicone against the glass. If it is applied on the outside, the water pushes the silicone away from the glass.

, Silicone needs to dry and cure for a minimum of 24 hours. If you are applying it in a cool and dry environment, you may need to wait closer to 48 hours. This time will allow it to set completely, assuring that it attaches properly to the glass and does not leak.You may use a heat lamp or other portable heat source to help cure the sealant, but do not heat above 110 degrees (F).

, Refill the tank enough so that there is some water in contact with the repaired seam. Wait a few hours and then fill the tank even further and then look for leaks. Finally, fill the tank all the way and then look for leaks. Take a close look at the area that was leaking and wait awhile to make sure that the water pressure inside the tank doesn't reopen the leak.Try taping a paper towel to the outside of the tank where the leak was and leaving it there for an hour or so. If the towel remains dry, your leak is fixed.
Keep towels and a bucket nearby, in case of continued leaking. This will allow you to quickly remove the water from the aquarium once again.

, If you have removed everything from the tank, including gravel, fish, and plants, you will need to replace them when you are confident the leak is repaired. Begin with the gravel and then add other objects on the aquarium floor. Add any chemicals to the water that are needed and then return any plants and fish back into the tank.


This is a really good time to make sure everything you put back in the tank is thoroughly cleaned before you put them back.

, In some cases, you will first spot a leak in your aquarium by noticing that the water level is dropping. While there is always some evaporation in fish tanks, any noticeable level drop could be due to a leak.If you have a severe leak, the location will likely be very evident and you will be able to find the source from a quick glance around the tank.

, If the leak is not obvious, you may first suspect one if there is unexplained water around the outside of your tank. Even a small amount of unexplained dampness could signal a problem.If you have changed a filter, added items into your tank, or otherwise interacted with the tank recently, water outside of the aquarium may be due to your activities. Try drying it up and then keeping an eye out for additional water pooling up. If the water returns, then you have a leak.

, If you suspect there is a leak, but its location is not evident, then you will need to do a bit of investigating. Look for metal corners that appear to be separated from the glass, and for sealant protruding in the corners. These are tell tale signs that the aquarium has a problem.Also, feel around the edges. If you feel water, move upward from that location, until the surface feels dry. The furthest spot towards the top of the tank that is wet is likely to be the leaking area.

, If you find the location of the leak, or you have an area where you suspect the leak is, you should mark that area with a felt tip pen. This will allow you to keep track of the area once your tank is empty and you begin repairs.


Most felt tip pen marks can be easily removed with glass cleaner after you finish your repairs.

, Leaks along the seams of your aquarium are relatively easy to fix because they are usually caused by a failure in the silicone, and silicone can be easily replaced. However, if the leak is due to a cracked side or bottom of your tank, that is not as easy to repair. Replacing a whole piece of glass will take a lot more time, expertise, and energy. Basically, replacing a glass panel of an aquarium will likely require the skills of a professional.


If one of the sides or the bottom of your tank has cracked, it is likely that the whole aquarium will fail. A crack in the glass will spread due to the pressure of the water and once it spreads far enough, the glass panel will collapse.

Wipe it clean with a soft cotton cloth, freeing it from dirt and dust. Work with a clean surface so you don’t add additional scratches as you work.Wear rubber gloves while cleaning to protect your hands from the chemicals.
Use only a clean soft cloth, rather than one of your sponges that already has cleaning products on it.
Allow the surface to dry before continuing to the next step.;
, Dip your sandpaper in the bucket of water as you work. It's also important to wet down the surface, to keep it from getting too hot. Acrylic will melt at high temperatures. As you work, touch the aquarium surface cautiously, to make sure it isn't too warm. If it's hot to touch, take a break. Add water to the surface, allow it to cool, and then continue.

, Work in circles. Remember to keep the paper wet. The surface should now feel smooth. Don't worry if the surface is hazy from the sandpaper creating tiny scratches. You will remove these with the polish.

Choose a good protein skimmer.,
Install the skimmer.,
Empty the collection cup daily.,
Perform regular maintenance.",How to Skim Surface Scum from Your Fish Tank2," There are different types of skimmers available. These skimmers will filter your water to prevent the build-up of protein and other organic compounds in your water. The two most common are known as air-driven skimmers or venturi skimmers.


Air-driven skimmers use air stones to filter the water. These skimmers are typically less expensive, but they require more maintenance. The air stones will have to be replaced every month.
Venturi skimmers use a special valve to filter the water. They also require a special high pressure water pump to filter the water. They require less maintenance, but they are more expensive. You may have to buy the pump separately from the skimmer., Most skimmers attach to the side of your tank. Others simply sit in the water. Place the skimmer in the tank. You should make sure that your skimmer is sitting in between seven and ten inches of water.The electrical cord should sit above the surface of the water line. Make sure that the electrical cord does not touch the water. Keep the cord high above the skimmer, and plug it into an outlet where water cannot drip on it. This outlet should ideally be above the aquarium or sump.If you have a sump (an extra tank for water maintenance) attached to your tank, you can install the skimmer there. This will still effectively filter the water., No matter what type of protein skimmer you have, it will move its waste into a collection cup. This cup needs to be emptied or cleaned on a daily basis. In most models, the cup is attached to the top of the skimmer. It can be unscrewed, and the waste can be dumped out into the trash., Skimmers need special care to ensure that they are working properly. You should check your skimmer frequently to make sure that there is no debris pumping up in it.


If you have an air driven pump, you will need to replace the stones at least once a month.If you have a water pump (such as a venturi pump), you will need to check it weekly to make sure that there is no debris blocking the pump.

Replace the water.,
Invest in algae eating fish.,
Avoid overfeeding.,
Control the light.",How to Skim Surface Scum from Your Fish Tank3," Monthly water replacements will keep your water fresh and clean. This is especially important if you have algae in your tank.You only want to replace one-third of your tank’s water at any time. Stick a siphon into the gravel to remove water into a prepared bucket. You can then refill the tank with tap water using the same siphon.To make sure that you remove the right amount of water, use a bucket that only holds one third of the amount of your tank. For example, you can use a three gallon bucket for a ten gallon tank. When the bucket fills up, you should stop draining.You can use a special water changer to help with this process. A water changer attaches to your kitchen faucet. When it drains the water, the water is sent down the sink’s drain. You can flip a switch to then refill the tank., There are certain types of fish and marine animals that can help control algae in your tank. While they cannot eliminate all of the algae, they can help keep it under control. If you have crabs, fish, shrimp, or other filter feeders in your tank, you may not need a mechanical filter as the debris in the tank will provide nutrients to your filter feeders.Some filter feeders you may want to consider include:


Rubber nose pleco
Chinese algae eater
Otocinclus catfish
Apple snail (not preferable if you have live plants in your tank), Some of the scum in your tank might be excrement or old food. Not only can this waste cloud your tank, but it can also encourage the growth of algae. If you notice extra food floating in your tank, consider feeding your fish only once a day or in smaller doses., Algae use photosynthesis, which means that they thrive on light. Make sure that your lighting in your tank is only on for ten to fourteen hours a day. This will mimic natural conditions and prevent the growth of bacteria and algae."

Clean your filter regularly.",How to Cure Red Slime Algae in Marine Aquariums," If your tank is harboring red slime algae, the first step is to replace the nutrient-rich water in your aquarium with clean saltwater. You can do this by performing a partial water exchange.Aim to remove and replace about 10% to 20% of the tank's water. In a 10 gallon tank, that means about one or two gallons, which should be sufficient to ensure healthy water.Remove as much organic material and detritus from the tank's substrate as possible. Using a vacuum tube can be helpful here at removing debris from the gravel or sand at the bottom of the tank.
Make sure you also scrape away any red slime algae that's clinging to the underwater surfaces inside your tank.;
, Even if you've performed a partial water change, the tank may still be a breeding ground for red slime algae. Adding clean water isn't always enough, because the nutrients that algae feed off of are often lurking elsewhere in the aquarium, especially amid the gravel or sand at the bottom of your tank.If you can afford it, an under-gravel filter might be a great way to constantly remove excess debris from the gravel or sand.
A gravel vacuum can be useful for sucking out debris that settles in the gravel.
You can also use a siphon to clean out the substrate of your aquarium.You can find siphons at many pet stores or by searching online.
Introducing orange-spotted sleepers and pistol shrimp to your aquarium can be helpful if you use sand as a substrate instead of gravel. These creatures tend to sift through the bottom of the aquarium and stir up the red slime algae, allowing your tank's filters to catch and extract it all out of the water.

, If your tank is experiencing algal growth, it's important to take care of the water in your tank. However, algae that's already clinging to the tank can end up growing and blooming more, even if you're treating the water. Part of any red slime algae eradication should involve scraping away the algae that is clinging to your tank's walls and other internal surfaces.You can purchase a specialized scraper, like a Mag-Float, Algae Magnet Cleaner, or Kent Pro scraper.
These scrapers are available at many pet stores. If you cannot find one at your local pet store you can purchase one through an online retailer.
You can also try using the edge of an old credit card in a pinch, as this can help manually remove caked-on algae the same way a scraper would.

, A dirty filter is often the culprit behind algal blooms in an aquarium. If you're experiencing red slime algae, make sure you clean the filter as part of your algae eradication efforts.The media inside mechanical filters will need to be cleaned whenever they become dirty, and once the residue no longer washes off the filter it will need to be replaced.
If your tank has a dirty filter, the organic waste trapped inside could be releasing ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate into your tank's water.

, One of the biggest causes of red slime algae is the presence of organic debris (like left over food, fish waste, etc.) in the water column. Protein skimmers may be more effective than a regular filter at removing these materials from the tank's water.Protein skimmers pull out organic waste and will not allow that waste (or its chemical byproducts) to be released back into the tank's water, which may be a problem with other mechanical filters.Large external skimmers are the most effective at removing organic waste, but they must be properly adjusted to your tank. If they are not adjusted, they may leak a substantial amount of water onto the floor of your home.
You can buy a protein skimmer at many pet stores or through online retailers.

, Excess food is one of the most common sources of elevated phosphate in your aquarium. As that phosphate permeates the water, it creates an ideal environment for algae to bloom, which can make a mess out of your tank.It's important to watch how long it takes your fish to consume the food you give them.
If a few minutes have passed and there's still excess food that's not being eaten, that food will settle in the substrate of your aquarium.
Try feeding your fish one larger meal each day, or offer smaller portions if you want to continue feeding your fish multiple times each day., Because plants compete with algae for resources like light and nutrients in the water, they can help reduce or prevent algal blooms in an aquarium.As these plants take in nutrients like phosphorous and carbon dioxide, they produce oxygen, ensuring a cleaner, healthier environment.Sea grass and mangrove plants make excellent aquarium additions.Certain macro algae species can also be good at oxygenating marine aquariums. These algae are healthy and helpful additions to an aquarium, and can help displace red slime algae.
Some good macro algae species to try planting include caulerpa sertularioides, calupera asmeadia, and caulerpa mexicana., While light is necessary for most aquatic plants to survive, too much light exposure inside an aquarium can create an environment that allows algal blooms.This usually only becomes a problem with prolonged and close-range light exposure, and certain precautions can be taken to ensure a healthy tank.


Tanks should not be exposed to lights for more than 6 to 10 hours each day for ornamental aquarium setups, or 10 to 14 hours each day for planted aquariums.Try keeping lights on a timer if you're having trouble regulating the light cycle.
Make sure you change your light bulbs at least once every year. As lightbulbs age they lose their spectrum and intensity, which may promote algal blooms.

, If your aquarium seems to keep spawning new algal blooms no matter how much you clean the tank and limit food, it could be a problem with your tap water. It's generally a good idea to test your tap water to see if it may be contributing to the problem or causing it directly.You can test your water at home by buying a water quality test kit. These can easily be found online and may be available in your local pet store.
Phosphate is commonly added to municipal water supplies to help prevent pipe corrosion. It can also show up in well water if it leaches through the ground from yard fertilizers.Elevated levels of phosphates in your tap water can promote algal blooms in your aquarium.If your water is the problem, you can purchase a reverse osmosis water filter or other tap water filtration system. These are available at many home improvement stores or online.

, It's important to control the movement of water through your tank to ensure a healthy environment. Water flow will help keep the tank more oxygenated, but water that flows too fast can also have some negative consequences.If water does not flow quickly enough, it can become stagnant and less oxygenated.
When water flows too quickly, it can sweep away food into the tank's filtration system before fish have had a chance to finish eating it. Once inside the filter, this food will decompose and release additional phosphorous.
A powerhead or wave-making device can help improve water quality by increasing the rate of movement within your tank.Talk to an aquarium service expert about determining the proper flow rate for the size and type of aquarium you are managing. You can find experts online or by searching in your local phone book.

, Performing regular partial-water exchanges helps ensure a healthy environment. It's not so shocking to fish as having an entirely new tank full of water, but it's enough to keep the levels of nitrates and phosphorous down and remove dissolved organic material by displacing old water with cleaner, more-oxygenated water.Remember to only add salinated water to your marine aquarium. Aquarium salt can be purchased at most pet stores or through online retailers and mixed into your water at home.
Pour the new seawater into your tank very slowly. A rush of incoming water can frighten fish and could disturb the ecosystem.

, Part of keeping an algae-free aquarium should involve regulating your tank's pH on a regular basis. A slightly basic environment (meaning a slightly higher pH) can help prevent red slime algae from growing rapidly/aggressively once it has shown up in your tank.Most marine tanks should have a pH somewhere between 8.1 and 8.4.
You can adjust the pH with buffers or kalkwasser as needed.
You can buy a water pH testing kit at most pet stores that sell aquarium supplies. You can also purchase them through most online retailers.
Check the pH every time you perform a partial water exchange and adjust the water's pH accordingly.

, If you do a partial water change but don't clean your filter, the clean water will just be running through a dirty filter. This will reintroduce a lot of the nutrients and organic debris that you've worked so hard to remove from the tank.You should clean your filter every time you do a partial water change.
Some tank owners rinse the filter's media in a bucket of wastewater that's been removed from the tank so that the healthy bacteria on the media is not lost.
Other tank owners may prefer running the filter's media under a faucet to blast away debris and detritus, though this may damage the bacterial colonies.
Whichever method you choose, proceed with caution so that the bacterial colonies are protected, but make sure you remove all of the organic detritus/debris (or as much as possible).

Reintroduce your aquatic organisms.",How to Empty an Aquarium," You'll need to remove your fish and any other aquatic organisms before you can drain the water out of an aquarium. This requires great care, though, as fish tend to get frightened by this process and may become tangled in the nets.Choose the correct net size so that your largest fish will fit inside. Even if the nets are large enough, you'll still need to exercise caution so the fish don't get injured during the transfer.
Use two fish nets to catch your fish within the tank. Hold one net steady and use the other to ""herd"" your fish into the stable net one at a time.
Transfer the fish to a second tank large enough to hold them all.
If you're having a hard time catching your fish, you can try draining off a little bit of the water. Working in a shallower tank will make it easier to herd and catch the fish.;
, Once the fish have been removed from the tank you'll want to disconnect any power sources from the tank. Whether it's a filter, heater, or just an overhead light, you do not want any active electricity going to your tank when you start to empty the water.A plugged-in electricity source could cause electrocution if it gets wet. This can cause serious injuries which may even be fatal.
Once you've unplugged each device you can move it out of the aquarium so that it is not in the way.

, Taking everything out of the tank before you drain the water will make it much easier to complete the draining process. These objects will need to get rinsed, so it may be best to do this near a sink if at all possible.Take out any artificial plants and decorations (like toys or sunken objects) out of the aquarium. Leave them in the sink to be cleaned.
Doing this before you drain the water will allow any stirred-up debris to settle before you begin emptying the tank.

, Whether you're new to aquarium maintenance or have been doing it for years, there's always a chance that something might spill. It's generally a good idea to lay down protective materials whenever you drain the tank or change the water to ensure that nothing in your home gets damaged.Arrange a few old towels on the floor around your aquarium.
If you're really worried about spilling you can lay down tarps or mats underneath the towels for extra protection.

, There are two main methods of emptying an aquarium. The first is to siphon the water out using a hose.The second is to drain the water using a gravel cleaner that simultaneously drains water, such as The Python or Aqueon.If siphoning off the water with a hose, dip one end into the tank and begin filling the other end with water from a tap. Then stop filling the tap end and let it drain out; once water starts draining it will continue to draw water out of the tank.
If using a gravel cleaner, activate the device and submerge the intake end all the way down into the gravel.You'll need to lift and reposition the device periodically as it drains, but it can be much easier and less messy than using a siphon hose.

, If you used a gravel cleaner to drain the tank, your gravel should be clean enough to skip this step. However, if you used a siphon hose, you'll want to clean the gravel to remove debris like leftover food and organic waste.Collect the gravel in a colander. Make sure you only use this colander for cleaning your tank, as it will be too dirty to use for preparing food with.
Rinse the gravel under clean, running tap water. You can use warm water but you should avoid using very hot water, as this will kill the healthy bacteria your fish rely on.
Do not use soap or chemicals to clean the gravel, as these will also destroy the healthy bacteria that have colonized your tank.

, The filter in your tank traps a lot of organic debris, including leftover food and waste product. It's important to clean this equipment, but you need to do so carefully in order to avoid disrupting the bacterial colonies your fish depend on.If you use disposable filter media, simply discard the old cartridge and replace it with a new one.
If you use permanent filter media, you'll need to rinse your filter media under clean, running tap water. You can use cool or warm water but you should avoid hot water, as this can damage the healthy bacteria inside the filter.
Rinse any objects from the aquarium, such as toys and submerged artifacts, under clean, running tap water and set them aside.

, If you want to thoroughly clean the tank, you'll need to at least wipe down the walls inside of it. Built-up algae and other debris may need to be scraped off; otherwise, you should be able to use a sponge or special wipe to clean the glass.You can use an old credit card or ID card to scrape off algae that's stuck to the walls. Or, if you prefer, you can purchase a special tank scraper from a pet store to complete this task.
Use clean paper towels or specialized cleaning wipes to scrub the inside of the tank.
Do not use commercial cleaning products, as these will leave residual chemicals that can harm or even kill your aquatic organisms.

, Once you're finished cleaning the tank you can begin replacing the objects back into it. Set up the gravel, then arrange your filter and any artificial plants or toys in the substrate. Plug the filter and heater back in and make sure the water is habitable before reintroducing your aquatic organisms., If you have a home filtration system, your water may not need to be dechlorinated. If not, you'll need to dechlorinate your tap water before introducing your fish to the water. The process is fairly simple, and there are two main methods of dechlorinating your water.


You can dechlorinate your water naturally by leaving it out in an opened container for several days. Over time the chlorine will evaporate out of the container, leaving only the now-dechlorinated water.
You can dechlorinate water quickly and easily by adding a few drops of dechlorination solution from your local pet store. Follow the instructions on the label to ensure that your water levels are safe for fish.

, A freshwater tank is somewhat easier to refill than a marine aquarium. You won't need to do much to the water, other than dechlorinating it and ensuring that it's the right temperature (if your aquatic organisms require a specific temperature range).Once you've dechlorinated enough water, you can simply pour it into the clean tank.
If your fish require a specific temperature range, you'll need to monitor the temperature of the clean water before adding your fish.

, A saltwater tank can be a bit more work than a freshwater tank, but with a little patience it's easily manageable. The biggest difference between saltwater and freshwater aquariums is the need to salinate the water before adding it to the tank.Mix a new batch of saltwater by combining your preferred commercial salt mix and the right amount of dechlorinated tap water. The specific gravity of your saltwater should measure 1.025.
Pour the prepared saltwater into the tank and fill it to your desired level. Be careful not to disturb any plants or live rocks at the bottom of the tank.
If your aquatic organisms require a specific temperature range you'll need to make sure the water is an acceptable temperature before reintroducing your fish.

, Once your tank is refilled and the temperature is correct (if relevant), you're ready to reintroduce your aquatic organisms. You can either use nets to scoop them out of their secondary container and into the clean tank, or you can carefully and gently pour them with the water from their container into the tank.


Make sure the filter and heater (if relevant) are working and have prepared the water before you reintroduce your aquatic organisms.
Scooping and transferring them may be less stressful for the fish than pouring them back in.

Reduce the lighting in your tank.,
Regulate the water temperature in your tank.,
Test your tap water.,
Install a protein skimmer in your tank.,
Change your filter media on a monthly basis.",How to Control an Algae Bloom," Partial water changes are one of the most efficient ways of combating algal blooms in your tank. By removing a portion of the water and replacing it with algae-free water, you'll essentially dilute the algae content of the water. You should generally do a partial water change every two weeks to protect the water quality in your tank.Drain or siphon off about 25% of the water in your tank. For severe algal blooms, you may need to replace more than 25% of the water.
Do not change more than 50% of your tank's water at any given time.This can upset the pH of your tank and could stress your fish, which may be fatal.
Test the pH before and after performing a partial water change. The pH should not go up or down by more than 0.2 units to avoid stressing your fish.;
, One way to help control an ongoing algae bloom is to physically remove the existing algae from your tank. This can be done while you're performing a partial water change, as you'll have easier access to the walls of your tank when the water level is lower.Scrape or wipe down the walls of your tank at least once every week.Be careful if using a sponge. In addition to harboring microorganisms, reusable sponges may trap grains of sand, which could scratch the glass.

, A commercially-available chemical algicide can help kill algae quickly and efficiently. However, you'll need to be careful with chemical agents like this, as they can upset the balance in your tank if used improperly.Do not use algicide if you have live plants in your tank, as algicide will most likely kill them., You can easily remove algae from your home aquarium by employing algae-eating fish and invertebrates to the tank. These living additions will eat algae off the plants, substrate, and even off the glass walls of the tank.Check with a knowledgable employee at your local pet store to find aquatic or marine organisms that can help control the algae in your tank.


Most species of aquatic snail will eat algae, whether in a freshwater or marine tank. Just be sure that you check at the pet store to ensure the snail you get can live in your tank at home.
Bristle stars, bristle worms, aquatic hermit crabs, Nassarius snails, and sea cucumbers will all help control algae in a marine tank by removing organic detritus from the substrate of your tank., Some plants produce and release chemicals that can help inhibit algal growth in a home aquarium. Fast-growing plants tend to be the most allelopathic. Some well-known allelopathic plants that can be added to your aquarium include Cabomba, Egeria, Ceratopteris, Hygrophila, and Vallisneria., Overfeeding of fish is one of the biggest causes of algal blooms in home aquariums. You may be tempted to feed your fish multiple times a day, or to add more food to ensure that your fish are well-fed, but all that extra food that isn't eaten ends up settling into the substrate and decomposing in the water. This fuels algal growth, and it can quickly turn an otherwise clean tank into a mess.Try switching to a fish food that's low in phosphates.The label should state the contents and levels of each ingredient.
Try feeding your fish only once per day. Some fish experts even recommend feeding fish every other day instead of every day, if the fish can handle such a feeding schedule (ask a fish expert at your local pet store).Experiment with how much food is enough for your fish. Usually a few pellets or flakes per fish are all that can be eaten before the excess food falls to the bottom of the tank.
If you're worried that may not be enough food for all of your fish, try feeding them a second time later in the day. However, be sure you feed them smaller portions for both meals.

, Food and light are the two biggest factors that permit an algal bloom. If you have a tank light over your aquarium, you may need to reduce how often you use it.In addition to reducing the amount of time your tank is lit, you should also replace the light bulbs in your tank. Various types of algae tend to thrive in differing wavelengths of light, and as your light bulbs age they tend to change from one wavelength to another.Try turning off the tank light altogether while you are battling with an active algal bloom.
Reduce the amount of time you light your tank once the algae is under control. Try to limit the light time to just a few hours per day.
Change fluorescent bulbs once every year, and change VHO lamps at least twice every year.

, Algae can grow in any temperature or condition. However, studies have shown that algae generally thrive the most easily in warmer temperatures.If you use a heater for your tank, try lowering the temperature by a few degrees. Just make sure that your fish can survive in the temperature range you're considering before you adjust the tank's temperature.


Check with a fish expert at your local pet store to determine what water temperature range your fish need to survive.

, Algae thrive when water contains high levels of phosphate and nitrate.Though municipal tap water is safe for consumption and generally low in phosphates and nitrates, there is always a chance that your water source is adding these algae-friendly nutrients to the tank every time you change the water.The best way to ensure that you're adding quality water to your tank is to test your tap water with a home testing kit.


Tap water should ideally be at 0 parts per million (ppm) when you test for nitrates and phosphates.
If your tap water tests higher than 0 ppm, you'll need to filter your water before adding it to the tank.
You can purchase a water quality testing kit and a water filter at many pet stores or through an online retailer.

, Protein skimmers will help remove organic material like waste and excess nutrients from the water in your tank. That way, if you accidentally overfeed your fish or if fish waste accumulates in the tank, you'll still be able to keep the water relatively clean.A proper protein skimmer should run continuously 24 hours a day.
You can discontinue or decrease use of the protein skimmer once your aquarium is free of algae.

, The filter on your home aquarium can easily build up organic wastes and nutrients. Even though the filter removes these elements from the water, a dirty filter will eventually start to leak those algae-friendly additives back into the tank. To combat this, the filter media should be changed every month.You should also rinse off the filter media every time you perform a partial water change to ensure that the nutrients and detritus do not build up inside the filter.

Place the filter into the fish tank.",How to Make Your Own Underwater Aquarium Filter1," The tube does not need to be very long, since the powerhead will be going under water. Plan on getting something at least twice the height of your sponge.


When choosing a powerhead, get something that will pumps twice as much water per hour as what's in your tank.
Sponge filters are ideal for delicate tanks.;
, What brand you use does not matter, but it needs to be the type of sponge used in aquarium filters. The easiest shapes to work with are a triangle or a cylinder. A triangle would fit the easiest in the corner of your fish tank. A cylinder may look neater, however. What ever shape you choose, make sure that is wider than your plastic tube.You can find filter sponges in pet stores and fish tank stores.
Consider getting a sponge with larger pores. They are better at housing the good bacteria, which help clean your tank.Sponge filters are ideal for shrimp and betta tanks. They are bio efficient, but don't create a lot of suction or water movement., The mark needs to be the same height as the sponge.You will be making air holes in the tube below this mark. These holes will be inside the sponge.

, You can use a heated nail and hammer to punch the holes, or an electric drill. Plan on making 8 to 10 holes per inch (2.54 centimeters) of plastic tubing., Make sure that you are plugging the end with all the holes in it. The tube will be going into the sponge, but the bottom still needs to be plugged up. You can use a pvc end cap that fits your tube, or even a piece of styrofoam., Push it all the way down to the bottom of the sponge. All of the holes in the tube should now be covered by the sponge.

, The powerhead will suck the water in, causing it to go through the sponge. All the mess in your aquarium will get caught in the sponge.

, The airline tubing doesn't have to be very long. About 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) will be enough.The clean water will flow out of this tube.

, If your air pump came with suction cups, use those to attach it to the wall of your tank. Angle the output tube so that the water will come out near the surface.

Plants and animals must be very small and few in number to survive.
Closed systems allow gas and air exchange (through, for instance, a sponge set in the opening). Gas exchange helps to regulate pH levels in the water, and allows for the removal of nitrogen and intake of carbon dioxide, making these systems easier to maintain.
Semi-closed systems require some maintenance. All closed systems will eventually fail. You can keep your system going longer by changing 50% of the water each month. This removes wastes and adds nutrients. If your system is in decline, change the water more frequently.;
, Freshwater systems are much easier to setup and maintain. Marine systems are less stable, but do allow for more interesting animal life, such as starfish and anemones., Mason jars, plastic 2-liter bottles, pretzel jars, or 3 or 5 gallon carboys will all work, though for beginners, a smaller system is usually easier to maintain.


For sealed systems, look for a container with a tight-fitting lid. For closed systems, consider covering the opening with cheesecloth or plugging it with a sponge., You can buy substrate at the store, or collect mud from a pond (which has the advantage of already having many of the tiny creatures you need in it).For clearer water, consider adding a layer of sand over the mud or substrate.

, The gravel layer will provide a surface for a microbial community and act as a filter, trapping particulate matter as gravity draws the water down through the gravel., Aquarium water or pond water is preferred, because they already contain the bacteria that your system will need.If using filtered water, you will need to let it first sit for 24-72 hours to let the chlorine dissipate.

, Plants provide food and oxygen for your ecosystem. You want plants or algae that are hardy and fast growing. You can collect them from a pond or purchase them. Some plants to consider include:Hornwort (freshwater) – Very hardy. Needs moderate light.
Pond weed, or elodea (freshwater) – Hardy. Needs low light.
Willow moss (freshwater) – Less hardy. Prefers cooler temperatures.
Bladderwort (freshwater) – Delicate.
Caulerpa algae (marine) – Hardy to the point of being a pest.
Chain algae (marine) – Requires high calcium levels.
Bubble algae (marine) – Hardy to the point of being a pest.

, Animals eat algae and other waste, keeping your ecosystem clean. They also produce the carbon dioxide the plants need to survive. Start with only one or two larger animals, or 10-20 hyalella.WARNING: Fish are not well suited to closed ecosystems. If you get them, they will die.The following animals are more appropriate:


Cherry shrimp (freshwater).Malaysian snail (freshwater).Hyalella (freshwater / marine depending on species).Copepods (freshwater / marine depending on species).Asterina starfish (marine).Aiptasia sea anemone (marine)., If using a container with a narrow opening, consider using a funnel avoid a mess.

, If they float after adding water, try placing more sand and gravel on top of them to keep them rooted., Cover all the exposed soil, but be careful not to crush your plant. Together, the substrate, sand, and gravel should fill 10-25% of the container., Remember, if using filtered water, be sure you have let it sit for 24-72 hours to allow chlorine to dissipate. The water should take up 50-75% of the container. Leave 10-25% for air., Before adding them, let them acclimate to the water temperature by floating the plastic bag they are in on the surface of the water for a few hours. Remember: start with only one or two shrimp or snails, or 10-20 hyalella. Too many animals will kill your ecosystem., For a sealed container, it is best to use a screw on cap or cork, though plastic wrap and a rubber band will do if that is all you have. For a closed container (allows air exchange), try cheesecloth or a sponge plug.

, It should be near a window, but not one that gets direct sunlight for many hours, as this will lead to temperature fluctuations that could kill off your snails or shrimp.Shrimp, copepods, and snails do best between 68°F and 82°F. Your container should be cool to the touch, but not cold., Too much or too little sunlight can kill your ecosystem.If your plants look unhealthy, try more sunlight.
If the water is getting cloudy or discolored, try more sunlight.
If you get algae, or your shrimp die on hot days, try less sunlight.
Be aware that seasonal changes may necessitate moving your ecosystem.

, This is important to keep your ecosystem healthy, as you probably won’t achieve the exact right balance at first.


Add more snails or shrimp if algae is growing. It is important to keep algae in check or it may cover the walls of your container, blocking out sunlight and killing your ecosystem.
If the water becomes cloudy, it may mean you have too many shrimp or snails. Try adding more plants.
If your animals are dying, add more plants.

, There is no sense in keeping your ecosystem around after it has failed, particularly since it may begin to smell. Here are some signs that you need to empty out the ecosystem and try again:A bad or sulfurous smell.
Strands of whitish bacterial growth.
Very few or no living animals.
Most of your plants are dead.

For freshwater fish, add water dechlorinator and cycle your tank.",How to Make an Aquarium," If you only have a few fish or a small tarantula, you won't need an aquarium that takes up the length of the wall. If you have a veritable pool of fish you need to house or a large iguana, that may be a different story. Since you're making the aquarium, you get to call the shots.


If you're placing water into the tank, remember that water is very heavy – about 10 pounds per gallon.You may want to go on the smaller side just to keep it more portable. There are some neat calculators available online, too, if you're stumped.Aquariums can also double as neat tables or shelves. If that's the case, measure the area you want to place it in to determine the right size.
If you choose, for example, a 14"" long aquarium, the sides should be around 13 1/2-"" long to account for them fitting into the front and back pieces.;
, This is also known as ""plate"" or ""sheet"" glass. Although annealed glass breaks into chunks and slivers, its superior strength makes it a good choice for aquarium building.


Do not use tempered glass (it usually has an identifiable etch mark in the corner). It is not strong enough. Laminated glass, toughened glass, and polycarbonate plastic are all other ""okay"" options, but they're subpar compared to annealed glass.
If only one side of your aquarium is going to involve glass, a combination of glass and fiberglass will work.
Upon purchasing your glass, ask the glass shop to sand or grind the edges so it doesn't end up cutting you.

, If your aquarium is going to be full of water, you'll likely need to err on the side of caution and go with thicker glass. 12"" full of water is very different than 12"" not full of water. If you're keeping it empty, even up to 14"" could be fine with 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick glass. Here are the general guidelines:Aquarium Height / Sheet Thickness
1 to 12 inches (2.5 to 30.5 cm) / 1/4 inch
12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) / 3/8 inch
18–24 inches (45.7–61.0 cm) / 1/2 inch
24–30 inches (61.0–76.2 cm) / 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm)

, You'll need:


100% silicone sealant

Many people say that ""aquarium silicone sealant"" is the only sealant you should consider. Although it's rather expensive, it is a good choice, partly because it lacks anti-mildew chemicals often in standard silicone sealants that can be toxic to fish over time. Regular household silicone like GE Door & Window clear silicone, Dow-Corning ""DAP"", and Napa All-Glass 100% clear silicone are also viable options. And if it comes in the size that fits in your caulk gun, even better.


Masking or duct tape
A caulk gun
A few large containers or heavy objects for holding up the glass

, Put the bottom piece of the glass down, surrounded by the front, back, and sides. Remember that the sides should be just shorter than the final measurement so they can snugly fit into the length between the front and back (those will go up first).


The difference in thickness should be twice the size of the glass. If you have 1/4"" inch thick glass, your side pieces should be 1/2"" in shorter (to account for the 1/4"" on either side).

, First, use acetone or rubbing alcohol on the sides of the glass. You want all the edges to be clean as can be. Then cut strips of masking or duct tape that are about half the length of one side. Stick half of each strip on the bottom of the bottom pane in every direction. The other half of the strip should be lying freely on the table.


Then when you put up the sides, you'll grab the other half of the strip and tape it on, giving support to each side of the tank.
You may want three pieces of tape on each side – on the left, right, and center of each pane.

, Start with the bottom piece, applying a thin and continuous strip of silicone along the top, about 2mm away from the edge (where the front pane of glass will rest on it). The strip of silicone should be about 3mm in diameter.


If you're not used to using a caulk gun, practice beforehand making even lines on something else, like newspaper or cardboard.
When you go to cut the top of the tube, aim for a 3mm opening to control the size of your output.
Be sure to work quickly; silicone sets in 2-3 minutes.

, With the strip of silicone along the front edge of the base, place the front piece of glass into place, pressing it down firmly but gently. Hold it there briefly, adhere the rest of the tape up the sides, and it should stay up. If you're worried about it falling over, you can prop it up with a large container filled with water or some other heavy object.


Don't wipe off the excess silicone just yet. You can take care of it after it's cured.

, With your caulk gun in hand, run another thin line of silicone (again, 2mm from the edge), along the sides. Then repeat along the inside edge of the front pane (remember: the side pieces are fitting not only into the bottom, but sandwiched in between the front and back).


Press the first side piece into place, firmly but gently. You should now have one corner of your aquarium put together it.
Try to avoid realigning the piece – if you do, you could create bubbles in the silicone, leading to leaking later on.Repeat this for the other side, too.

, Now that you're getting the hang of the caulk gun, run your last 3mm-wide lines of silicone along the edge of the bottom pane (2mm from the edge) and along the inside edges of the back panel.


Press it firmly, yet gently, into place. Lift up the tape to support and prop as needed.

, Most types of silicone dry within 24-48 hours.It will harden even more as time goes on, so if you can resist, don't fill it with water for a good week or so.

, Before you go about assembling a masterpiece in your aquarium, it's best to see if your craftsmanship holds up. Fill the tank with a few inches of water. Let it sit a minute. If it doesn't leak, continue on with assembly.


If it does leak, empty the aquarium immediately. Let it dry, and then reseal the problem areas. You may also want to assume there are problems near the top too, and fix those as well.

, If you're dealing with freshwater fish, you'll need a filtering system. The most common choices are undergravel filters or power filters and they're easily hung on the back of the tank.


If you're using an undergravel water filter, keep in mind the size of your aquarium. A large aquarium requires a large filter. The air pump needs to work for the entirety of the tank; not just the area it's immediately place in.
A power filter should circulate 5 gallons (18.9 L) of water per hour and per gallon of your tank's capacity. An 8 gallon (30.3 L) tank would need a power filter that can handle 40 gph.
Follow the specific instructions on your filter's packaging. Regardless of your model, do not turn it on until the tank is filled with water and ready to go.

, This goes on the inside of your tank and is usually attached with suction cups. It should be placed near the filter where water is constantly moving (so the temperature remains consistent throughout). Just like the filter, don't turn it on until everything is good to go.


Try to keep it to 3-5 watts of heat per gallon of water, in general. However, different fish do have different preferences; because of this, an adjustable, fully-submersible heater will be the easiest to use.
Remember that lights often produce heat and can interfere with your intended temperature. If this is an issue for you, there are lights available that don't heat up – and they're much better for fish.

, Most fish will be good with either gravel or sand, and any pet store will offer you a plethora of choices when it comes to texture and color. Whatever you use, 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) should be plenty.


Gravel does need to be washed before placing it into the aquarium. It has a tendency to acquire dust, which is something you do not want in your water.

, Everything will be easier to place (and it will stay in place) if you work with a few inches of water in your aquarium. Hopefully this time there won't be any leaks! Adjust as necessary, accounting for the weight of the water where need be.


Once you have the terrain all set up, fill the aquarium all of the way up. Most people recommend a gap of about 1"" or so from the top, though this is ultimately up to you – some prefer not to see a water line at all., Fish do the opposite of thrive in tap water, thanks to chemicals in it like chlorine. On the dechlorinator packaging, it should tell you how much is appropriate to use for your size of tank. You may also want to use a bacterial catalyst like SafeStart, which will speed up the growth of good bacteria in your aquarium.


Once that's in, you'll need to do a fishless cycle to monitor the water parameters (pH, High pH, Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate). Get an aquarium testing kit and wait for the numbers to spike and lower to 0. When this happens, it's time to add your fish.
An ammonia remover may be useful if the levels are too high. What's more, as time progresses, you should change 15% of the water routinely to keep it fresh and clean.

Know the size of your tank.,
Plan.,
Go out to your local hardware store and pick up lengths of 1/2"" or 3/4"" PVC.,
While at the hardware store, ask the clerk where you can get PVC cutters, I got a decent pair for $6.87.,
Once you've got the filter pattern planned out, begin cutting and assembling the pieces outside of the empty tank.

,
After all pieces are assembled, use a hammer and nail, or a power drill to punch holes into the bottom of the PVC pipes.,
Now take the completed UGF and put it into the fish tank.,
Run the air tube(s) down to the bottom of the uplift tube(s).,
Using proper techniques, finish setting up the aquarium (washed gravel, de-chlorinated water, additional power filter (if desired).

",How to Create an Undergravel Filter for Your Fishtank," Measure its length width and height.;
, Try to think of a design that would allow the PVC to make a closed circuit, and cover a good amount of area. Also leave about a half inch from the sides of the tank and the PVC tubing, as this will allow your substrate to fill in the gap hiding the UGF. Making a closed circuit simply cuts a few dollars off the price of the build by not having to buy caps. Double check to be sure.

, My local store sold it in 10' lengths, and it cost > $2.00. 1/2"" would be best for 5 1/2 - 20 gallon tanks. 3/4"" would be better for 30 or more gallon tanks. Make sure you have all of the elbows and T connectors you'll need. Take into account the lift tubes, which will need 1 T connector for each lift tube

, Try to get the kind that ratchet, it will make cutting easier.

,, This will allow water to be drawn into the UGF as it operates. Be careful not to hurt yourself, or go through the other side of the PVC pipe.

, Make sure the uplift tubes are not sticking out of the tank.

, For PVC pipe 1"" or greater in diameter attach an air stone at the end of the air tube and drop that into the uplift tube.

Poke holes into the capsule lid using a heated nail and hammer or electric drill.,
Drill a small hole into the side of the tube.,
Push the airline tubing into the small hole.,
Lift the lid out of the way.,
Fill the capsule with your filter media.,
Close the lid tightly, and place the capsule at the bottom of your fish tank.,
Attach the other end of the airline tubing to the air pump.",How to Make Your Own Underwater Aquarium Filter2," Film canisters, prescription containers, and empty fish food containers are perfect for this. These filters are great for small tanks.

, Do not use any soaps or chemicals, or you will kill your fish. If you are using a film canister, clean it with water and a few drops of a tap water conditioner. Make sure that the conditioner says that it will remove heavy metals. This is because film canisters usually contain traces of heavy metals.

, Find a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide plastic tube. Cut it down to 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) long. Cut a notch into the bottom of the plastic tube. You can also cut the bottom of the tube at an angle. This will help the water flow better.


You can find plastic tubes at fish tank and pet stores. You may also find them in home improvement stores.

, The hole should be just a little smaller than your ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) tube. This is so that you get a snug fit, once you put the tube in. You can cut the hole right in the middle of the lid, or close to the edge.

, The notched/angled bottom of the tube should be hitting the bottom of the capsule. If you cut the hole close to the edge of the lid, angle the tube so that the notch is facing the center, not the side of the capsule.

, If you take a look at your lid, there should still be some flat area left around the tube. Fill this area with small holes. This is where the bubbles will come out of.

, Keep the tube inside the capsule/lid. Measure ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) up from the seam, where the tube meets the lid. Make a small mark. Then, make a hole right on the mark. You can use a heated nail and hammer or an electric drill to do this. The hole should be large enough for a piece of airline tubing to fit through snugly.


Make the hole just a little smaller than the airline tubing. This will give you a tight fit.

, Keep feeding it down the bigger tube, until it is about halfway down the capsule. It should not touch the bottom of the capsule.

, Do not pull the plastic tube out. Keep it pressed firmly against the bottom of your capsule. You will be filling the capsule with filter media next. If you pull the tube away now, the filter media will get stuck under it.

, You can use zeolite, or any other media used in aquarium filters. Activated charcoal is a great, cheap alternative. It works well for removing bacteria. Check your local pet store or fish tank store.

, The plastic tube and capsule will both be under water. The airline tubing will go out of the water, and to the air pump.

, Depending on how deep your tank is, and how far away your air pump is, you may need to cut the airline tubing down. Measure the tubing first and trim it down if needed. Plug it into your air pump once it is the right length. Your filter is now ready to use.Position the

Stick the intake valve of the powerhead into the mouth of the bottle.,
Fit a piece of airline tubing onto the output nozzle of the powerhead.,
Place the filter in your tank.",How to Make Your Own Underwater Aquarium Filter3," The neck of the bottle should fit right over the intake valve of the powerhead. Remember to choose the right powerhead for your tank; it should pump twice as much water as what's in your tank per hour.


The more powerful your powerhead is, the larger bottle you will need.
Bottle filters are great for large tanks.

, Cut about two-thirds of the bottom corner out, but leave part of the base intake, or your filter media will fall out. This is where the water will come in and out of.

, You can find filter floss in your pet store or in a fish tank store. Try to pack the floss into the bottle, so that it is dense. The filter floss will catch debris.

, About 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) should be enough.The charcoal will filter out bacteria and toxins.

, Remember to pack the filter media somewhat, so that it is snug. The will help filter out the biggest pieces of debris.

, This is not necessary for all tanks, but if you have shrimp, small fish, or delicate fish, this would be a very good idea. Simply wrap some mesh over the hole, and secure it with string. Women's hose are great for this., The intake valve will suck the dirty water into the bottle. The filter media inside will clear all of the dirt out.

, A 3 inch (7.62 centimeters) long piece will be enough. The clean water will come out of this tube.

, If the powerhead has suction cups, use them to attach it to the wall of your tank. Angle the airline tubing towards the surface of the water.

Use your fingers.,
Remove the plants from the aquarium.,
Clean with a toothbrush or algae pad.",How to Clean Aquarium Plants1," Wash your hands thoroughly. Next, gently rub the algae off of plants while the plants are still in the aquarium. Remove any algae that you’ve rubbed off from the aquarium.


Once you have clean plants, maintain their cleanliness on a weekly basis by rubbing the algae off them while they are in the aquarium.;
, If the algae doesn’t come off easily in the water, remove the plant you’re cleaning from the aquarium. Check for any fish, snails, or other creatures that might be attached to the plants. Put the plant in a sink, bathtub, or similar container. Gently place those back in the aquarium.Don’t remove all of the plants at once. This could cause stress for your fish.

, After removing the plant from the aquarium, use a clean toothbrush or an aquarium-safe algae pad to remove debris that won’t come off with your finger. Gently scrub all parts of the plant. Fold the algae pad if needed to get into smaller crevices of the plant. Rinse all algae off the plant with clean water before returning it to the aquarium.Keep a separate toothbrush that is dedicated to cleaning your fish tank plants. Never clean your aquarium plants with a toothbrush that has been used for any other purpose.

Add live plants.,
Keep it clean.,
Add algae hungry critters.",How to Decrease Aquarium Algae Naturally," Checking the parameters of your tap water is always a must any time you are having some sort of biological issue with your aquarium. Look for high Nitrates, Nitrites and Ammonia. These will usually be indicators of the cause of your brown algae bloom. Chemicals in the tap water itself, such as Phosphates, can also increase algae.;
, Green algae typically occurs when there is too much light source in an aquarium. Keeping the aquarium away from an unshaded window, and only turning the aquarium lights on when viewing can decrease the green algae tremendously.


Keep lights on 10-14 hours per day for planted aquariums, 6-10 for ornamental setups. Also, change bulbs at least once a year.

, Brown algae typically occurs when tanks are being 1. Overfed, or if there is an 2. Overstocking problem in your tank, with 3. Not enough filtration.


Brown algae feeds on nitrates, so watch for aquatic animals with high biological load such as Goldfish, Cichlids, Mollies, Crayfish, and Turtles.

, A healthy routine of water changing reduces the amount of waste in an aquarium. Changing 20% of the water each day - a few days can reduce algae if it is a massive bloom.


Do NOT change more than this, it can upset the natural balance of your aquarium.

, Spring for a filter that is meant for 20–40 gallons (75.7–151.4 L) more than the size you actually have (40 Gallon tank, 60-80 gallon filter).


The more filtration, the more clean your water will be. You can additionally add bubbler systems to pump more oxygen into the aquarium.

, Brown algae feeds on an over-abundance of nutrients in the water, which include the bacteria called ""Nitrates"" that is the end result of your animals' ammonia production. Green algae also feeds on this, but not to such extent as brown algae.


Adding live plants will reduce algae since the ""nutrients"" will be going to the plants instead of the algae, basically starving it out.

, Unfortunately, we have to use sponges and scrubs to clean the algae off glass and acrylic sometimes! Cleaning your aquarium is inevitable. It includes maintaining your filter material, siphoning hidden waste from your gravel floor and of course, scrubbing algae off things! Take all the aquarium ornaments out and place them in a bucket. You can fill it up with some of your tap water and gentle scrub the algae away. Some people will use a very small bit of bleach mixed with the water and let the ornaments sit. As long as you wash all of it off before you replace them, it is safe.

, If your aquarium and parameters allows for it (space, water quality, etc) adding some algae hungry critters, or those which can help eat the extra food on the ground, can help reduce the problem, too.

For a little over one gallon (15.14 L) of the solution, mix 4 tablespoons (59.14 mL) bleach to one gallon (15.14 L) of water. Do not use scented or gel bleach. They will not rinse off the plants well and can leave a chlorine or chloramine residue on the plants., Remove the plant from the aquarium and soak it in the bleach solution. Only soak a live plant for five minutes. Soak an especially delicate plant for even less time., After taking the plant out of the bleach, gently use your fingers to rub off any remaining algae. Next, submerge the plant in a bucket of clean water and soak it for another ten minutes. Remove it from the clean water and rinse it thoroughly before placing it back in the aquarium.


You can also bleach artificial plants. Soak them up to ten minutes in the bleach solution. After rinsing the plants, allow them to air dry before placing them back in the aquarium.

, It is much easier to find a piece of driftwood or a couple of rocks that are the right size for your aquarium than a pre-made decoration. Natural pieces often have organic, irregular, and random shapes, all of which will make your aquarium appear more interesting. Be sure to thoroughly rinse any natural decoration before putting it into your aquarium, even if you bought it in a store. Most items found in nature will contain harmful bacteria, and store-bought items are often covered in dust.


Do not use soap or tap water to clean your decorations; instead, rinse them using some of the aquarium water, then put them in a separate (isolation) tank for a few weeks. This will allow the piece to get the good' bacteria and make it safe for your fish. Afterwards, you may add the piece to your aquarium., When designing your aquarium, try to keep your fishes' behavior in mind.Some fish species are timid and need plenty of hiding places in order to feel comfortable, while other types of fish are very active and need lots of room to swim in; decorations would only get in their way. Here are some examples:


If you have a timid fish species, consider adding some decorations with holes in them, such as vases, rocks, and logs for nice looking hiding spaces.
If you have more active fish species, avoid crowding your tank with large, bulky items. Instead, consider filling your tank with smaller decorations or plants; the fish will be able to swim around the plants.
Regardless of fish type, try to include a few decorations. Decorations are very important, as they will give your fish places to hide in when they feel stressed or unhappy., Not only do real plants look much better, but they are also great at maintaining the water quality by filtering out toxins and waste. When buying plants for your tank, be sure to buy ones labeled for fish tanks; some plants can be toxic to fish.You can purchase aquarium plants in the fish department of more pet stores, and in many fish tank stores. Here are some suggestions:Amazon Sword has bright green, blade-like leaves.
Amazon Frogbit is a floating plant.
Java Fern has a similar shape to the Amazon Sword, but more delicate and textured leaves.
Vallisneria is a short, grass-like plant. These would loke great towards the front of the tank.
Anubias may develop a lily-like flower if allowed to grow past the water level.
Anacharis is a long, thin, flexible plant, and would look great planted towards the back.

, Not only will it look more proportionate than bulky gravel or rocks, but it may also make the fish feel more at home and comfortable.Try to avoid getting anything that is too rocky. Five gallon tanks are small and get dirty quickly; gravel and stones trap debris, which makes them difficult to clean. Here are some options:Gravel comes in many different colors and sizes. Look for something that is small-grained and smooth. Natural colors might look better in a small tank than bright, un-natural colors.
Sand is a great option for small tanks. Look for a medium-grained sand, such river sand, and avoid fine-grained ""play sand.""
Marbles, rocks, and larger stones may look pretty, but they are best saved for decorations. Instead, consider filling the bottom of your tank with fine-grained gravel or medium-grained sand first, and then dropping a few aquarium marbles on top.
Keep your plants healthy by adding nutrient tabs under the sand or grave; this will give your plants extra nutrients (such as iron) that they won't get from the water alone.Most aquarium plants will do just fine in ordinary aquarium sand or gavel, however, and do not need special soil like house plants do. You can find nutrient tabs for aquatic plants in the fish department of most pet stores.

, Neon-colored gravel, plastic decorations, and fake plants tend to look better in larger tanks than in smaller ones.Anything that is too brightly colored will also clash with your fish, making the already-small tank appear cluttered and messy. Instead, consider creating a more natural environment by using brown-colored gravel or sand, pieces of driftwood or rock, and some real plants. The natural colors will contrast with your brightly-colored fish, helping them to stand out more.

, Certain types of fish will do better than other types of fish in a small tank. This section will give you suggestions as to what type of fish you should consider and what type of fish you should avoid.

, Most fish sold in stores are very young and will grow much larger (such as gold fish, plecos, and angel fish). Just because a fish is small when you buy it does not mean it will stay small. Your new fish may quickly outgrow its tank within a few months. A large fish should not be kept in such a small tank. Not only will the fish be unhappy, but it won't be very healthy.

, Not only will large fish make your tank appear crowded, but they will produce more waste than the tank can handle. Smaller fish, on the other hand, will appear more proportionate; you can also keep several fish in a small tank provided that they are small enough. Here are some fish that you should definitely avoid, and why:


Anything from the Cichlid family, including Dwarf Cichlids. They will grow large and need more room to swim than a five gallon tank can offer.
Any Corys larger than 1.5 inches (4 centimeters) are too big to be comfortable in small conditions like this.
Plecos and Loaches will not fit in a five gallon tank once they reach full size.
Other large fish, such as: Arowanas, Knifefish, Elephant Nose, and Eels.
Rainbowfish are very active and need to be kept in groups. Even the smallest ones get too big for a small tank.
Anything from the cyprinid family, including Goldfish, Carps, Danios, Freshwater Sharks, Chinese algae eaters, some Barbs, and Rasboras.

, A five gallon tank is small, which means that waste will build up a lot quicker. Some fish (most notably goldfish) will produce waste a lot quicker and lower the quality of the water.

, Some fish are very active and need a lot of space to swim. A five gallon tank does not have a lot of room to swim, even for very small fish. Peaceful and less active fish species are the most suitable for small tanks.If you want to get some more active fish, then consider getting a long tank as opposed to a tall one; this will give your fish more swimming space.

, Although both males and females are brightly colored, the males tend to have longer, flowing fins. They are solitary fish however, and do not fare well with other companion fish. Bettas can be very aggressive and territorial, leading them to bully other fish. Their fins are also delicate, and can be tempting for other fish to nibble on.


Bettas are also knows as Siamese Fighting Fish for a reason. Do NOT keep more than one betta in a tank. They will fight and and kill each other.

, Certain types of fish are happier if they are kept in groups of five to seven. When choosing a school of fish, look for something that is no larger than 1.2 inches (3 centimeters), and make sure that they are all the same species.Here are some suggestions:


Neon tetra or green neon tetras. Both are small and colorful.Keep in mind that most tetras are fast-moving fish and will be happier in a larger tank.
Cherry Barbs are small, red-colored fish with pale-colored bellies.White Cloud Mountain Minnows are pale gold in color with short, red or orange-colored tails.Least Killifish are pale yellow in color and do best in groups composed of one male and two females.Pygmy and Dwarf Corys are small, silver fisher with a black stripe.

, Adding just one or two of these little guys can help keep your tank looking clean. They can also add some interest to the bottom area of your tank, which is where they like to live. Here are some options for you:


A silver and black Otocinclus would be a great addition to a small tank, they are bottom feeders, so they will help keep the tank clean.
A couple of Cherry Shrimp can be a wonderful addition to any tank, just be sure to give them plenty of hiding places in case the other fish try to bully them.Shrimp are bottom feeders and can help your tank stay cleaner.

, This will make your aquarium appear more organized instead of cluttered. It will also help guide the eye around. Lastly, it will also add depth to your aquarium, making it appear larger than it actually here.


Place smaller decorations, such as decorative marbles and stones towards the front of the aquarium.
Place larger decorations, such as rocks and pieces of driftwood, towards the middle of the aquarium.
Longer and thinner items, such as plants, should be placed towards the very back of the aquarium.

, Most small aquariums come in two different shapes: a long rectangle and a tall cube or hexagon. This will determine whether you use long and wide decorations or tall and thin decorations. Here are some ideas on how you can work with the shape of your aquarium:For rectangular aquariums: This is your standard tank; it is wider than it is tall. Because of this, very tall decorations may not look very pleasing; instead, try using some wider decorations, such as logs and branches. Lay these down on their sides and add a few rocks. Make sure that none of your decorations are more than two-thirds the height of your tank. Don't forget to add a few plants towards the back.
For tall cubes and hexagons: Because your tank is taller than it is wide, you won't have much room to spread out, so you will have to build upwards. Place your largest decoration, such as a large rock or piece of driftwood, towards the middle or back of the tank. Arrange a few small rocks in front of the central pieces, and add a few tall and slender plants in the back. Make sure that your decorations go no more than two-thirds past your tank's height.

, Aquarium backgrounds are usually sold in rolls, and you can find them in most pet stores in the fish department as well as in most fish tank stores. You can purchase a solid-colored background, a patterned one, or even depicting a nature scene. Once you have chosen your background, trim it so that it fits your aquarium, and tape it to the back wall from the outside.


Consider buying a natural-looking one depicting logs, rocks, and underwater plants. Not only will this match the decor of your aquarium, but it will make it look larger.

, All aquariums need to be cleaned every once in a while, and the smaller a tank is, the more often it will need to be cleaned. For heavy algae buildups, you may even have to take everything out of your tank for a deep scrubbing. If cleaning your tank sounds like a hassle, consider a simpler setup instead of a complex one. Try using one large decoration as your focal point, a few plants, and a few smaller pieces; these will be much easier to take out than a bunch of smaller items and a ton of plants.

, Filters and pumps aren't very interesting to look at, but they are important for your tank. Try placing yours in the back corner of the tank, and placing a few tall plants in front of it.

, While fish do not need anything more than the natural light in your room, an electrical light above their tank can certainly make them appear more colorful. Some aquarium kits already come with a light, but it is also possible to purchase a special lid for your tank with a light attached to it. You do not need to leave the light on all the time; generally, a few hours a day is fine. Be sure to ask the store employee how much light your plants and fish should get, as each species has different requirements.

",How to Convert an Old TV Into a Fish Tank,";
, Console televisions usually have a removable back, but you may have to go in through the side.

,


Be especially careful not to shatter the tube, as the older models can be very dangerous. See Warnings for additional information.







, Unless you plan to integrate them into the design, remove interior compartments to free up space.

, The knobs on the television may jut into the body of the wooden console depending on your television’s model. Since the goal is to empty the console to make room for a fish tank, you may have to remove a knob or two; however, if they are all to one side, consider leaving them in place and devoting that cramped end of the box to any ugly, external pieces of the aquarium that need to be included in the setup (ex. the air pump).

,


If necessary, measure the spaces for the actual aquarium and its out-of-water components separately.







, Using the TVs internal measurements, buy an aquarium and any additional components necessary including a filter, air pump, overhead light, and tubing. Make sure the tank that is wider and slightly taller than the screen. Be especially careful to leave room between the top of the aquarium and the lid of the console for an overhead light, which your fish and plants will need if they’re going to be enclosed in a dark box.



Place the air pump inside the cabinet to suppress the noise. However, it can be mounted outside if there is not enough room.






If you don’t have space to fit an overhead light inside the console, consider getting a remote ballast light instead.






If your TV console won't fit a standard tank size, you can have one custom-built to fit.







, Arrange them inside the TV console and make sure there is room for everything. Don’t fill the aquarium yet.

, If possible, cut out an additional discrete hole to encourage ventilation and discourage condensation.

, The most elegant way of approaching this is to cut the entire existing lid off at the seams.


Attach hinges, and turn it into a flip lid. Alternatively, you can remove the existing top and replace it with a flip lid made from a new piece of wood stained to match the old paneling.






Replace the back of the TV.







, If the bottom doesn’t look capable of holding up gallons and gallons of water, you can either replace it with a stronger piece of wood or reinforce it with underneath with wood or metal.

, Use a water-resistant finish such as polyurethane to protect the enclosed space from becoming water-damaged.

, If you need to run a cord from inside the tank to a power source and it won’t reach the wall, attach a surge protector with a long cord directly to the dry back of the aquarium to bridge the distance while keeping the area relatively tidy.

, Attach the pump, filter, and hoses, then set up the aquarium itself. Use these guides to set up either a freshwater or a saltwater aquarium.


Cycle the tank before adding fish. This is an absolute must if you want your fish to live for more than a week or two. To humanely cycle the tank, do a fishless cycle.

It is required to let the water stand in the aquarium with all the equipment running for at least two weeks before you release the fish.",How to Make Your Fish Tank Look Professionally Designed1," This will not only mimic your fish's natural habitat, but it is also much more appealing to the eye than hot pink or teal. One way to give a really 'natural' look is to put 1/2 aquarium-designated sand, and 1/2 play sand (like the kind you'd put in a sandbox). Sand from a beach or your local fish store should be thoroughly rinsed of soluble material with a fine mesh. But be aware that play sand in a marine tank will cause diatoms and sand in general might prevent your live plants from expanding their roots and thus minimize their growth.


However ""black water fish"" (many tetra species) from the Amazon River area, and Labyrinth (Gouramis & Bettas/Siamese Fighting Fish) prefer a dark substrate. Also, if the sand is too fine and too deep (> 1.5 inches), it will set-up an anaerobic environment which will develop a foul odor, and may rot plant roots that penetrate it. A thin layer of sand is fine, but it should be over pea or 1/2 pea sized gravel, and perhaps an organic level beneath that to nourish plants.;
, There's just something about nature that silk or plastic can't mimic. It's recommended to go the live plant route not only because plants produce oxygen and help the water quality, but also because fish respond better to surroundings that resemble their natural habitat.There are a lot of plant species that are easily kept, but you have to do some research in order to keep them alive and thriving. If you're not up to keeping live plants, look for tasteful fake plants which have no sharp edges or thick parts on which the fish can harm themselves or tangle in. Green and red are generally the colors found in nature, and really look the best. Try to get a good variation in color darkness/lightness and height. Think about your preferences, would you rather have a sand-bed looking tank, or a tank that looks like you just stepped into a majestic underwater garden? Most fish prefer a ""jungle"" look and feel more comfortable in a well-planted tank, but there are species that will probably eat your plants so think about your choice of fish while considering the look you want.

, It's best to use natural decorations such as driftwood and coconut halves because they are less likely to harm your fish. If you decide to use artificial decorations, find logs, rocks and driftwood pieces that mimic the appearance of the real thing, have smooth edges and are manufactured from non-toxic materials. The safety of your fish should always be top priority.

, Black adds depth, and makes a tank look so much better than no background or a busy background. Think of it like photography - would your portrait look better if behind it is a busy activity area, or would it look better if you were the main focus on a plainer background? A tank with a black background will pop both in photos and in your living room.

, Try sloping the substrate to give it the appearance of hills and valleys. It really adds a neat look, and is much more interesting to view than if your substrate was flat all across. If you put some thought to it and do it right, it can also add some depth.

, It looks better than trying to 'balance' your tank out on two sides, or putting a piece in the exact center. Or, if you found a whole bunch of rocks, try designing it so they go from the left/right to the center. Make sure that you leave ample room for the fish to move about and also to hide. A broken upturned ceramic cup does a neat job and you can easily cover it with some live plants (a wide variety of mosses are all readily available at most pet stores).

, You can never have too much depths, so you want to put the taller plants in the back and shorter plants in front to create some more. It will also help you to see your fish more easily.

, Different lighting can have amazing effects on how a tank looks. You can try the very interesting sunset lighting.

, You should occasionally put some fish food in the empty tank. That period is called the fishless cycling. During that time, the good bacteria (which will keep ammonia levels from the fish feces under control) grow in your filter. It is vital you don't skip the fishless cycling and is advised you do some more research on this topic.

Do not believe the old myth that a fish will grow to the size of its environment. Yes, it is true that a fish with more territory and more food tends to be larger. But with monster fish, there is a minimum size they will grow to regardless of space. So it is definitely worth it to get a larger tank. When tank size increases, price tends to skyrocket very quickly. For example, say a five gallon tank is 15 dollars. That doesn't mean that a 150 gallon tank is only going to be 450 dollars. As the tank gets bigger, the glass has to get thicker. A brand new 150 gallon tank is well over 1,000 US dollars, not including filter, food, etc. Unless you want to pay for a brand new one, you may want to try looking at garage sales or resale shops.;
, After buying an empty tank, you will need several things as a necessity. These include a stand, light(s), a filter appropriate for your tank size, an appropriate amount of bubblers, and a strong enough heater:


Stands: When it comes to getting a stand, with big tanks it's safer to use one made specifically for a tank of that size (rather than any old dresser or table). One gallon of water equals 8.34 pounds (meaning that a 300 gallon tank is well over a tonne). A stand also adds to the tank's price. When buying used tanks, it is usually harder to find one that comes with a stand. This is one advantage to buying a brand new tank.
Filter: You can either use more than one large store-bought filter, or if you're rather handy, you can build your own more efficient system.
Bubbler: Bubblers help keep the water in motion, but their main purpose is to oxidate the water. A fish's gills separate the oxygen and hydrogen molecules in the water. If you leave the fish in a tank without a bubbler, the water eventually becomes acidic because the fish use up all the water and suffocate.
Heater: You can either buy several submersible heaters, or make a larger investment in a more efficient one.
Note: Certain fish (such as African cichlids or river-dwelling fish such as trout) require a strong current for exercise. This is another maintenance item you will have to add to your list.

, Décor may not seem important, but it can be essential to your fishes' health. Depending on the species, different behavioral requirements exist. Many fish like to hide in caves or behind rocks. Many predator fish like to feel as though they are stalking their prey, sneaking around obstacles (much like lions in a zoo). This is why décor can help improve your tank's quality.


Plants also have many benefits. Not only do they look pleasant, but they also help keep your water clean, as well as enriching pH and oxygen levels. However, many predator fish (such as members of the Cichlid family) like to munch on plants as well as meat. Do your research before buying live plants for your tank.

, You will also want to stock up on food before buying your fish. Although your fish will probably be hesitant to eat the first several days, it's still good to have it ready. You may also want to purchase dechlorination formula, mineral supplements, bacterial and/or fungal medicine, and aquarium salt (not marine salt––aquarium salt is made for freshwater fish and helps strengthen their immune systems). You may also want to get a water testing kit and a thermometer.

, This part is pretty self-explanatory. Simply move your stand and tank to where you want it to go. Do this carefully, though; put it near a window to make it easier to do water changes. Also make sure the tank is in no danger of being cracked or is near any chemicals or hot surfaces.

, This may not seem important, but proper substrate is vital to making your fish happy. Substrate is any type of rock, mineral, or organic material that covers the bottom of an animal's habitat. There are many options to choose from, the easiest being gravel.


Gravel: Buy a few bags of aquarium gravel (which comes in many colors and looks much nicer), or if you want you can just buy much cheaper all-purpose gravel from your local Home Depot and clean it using a strainer.
Sand: Sand is not usually good because it gets kicked up easily and clouds up the water. However, bacteria will eventually grow and make sure the sand doesn't float around the water for long. Some fish need sand, so accommodate this need!
Aquarium soil: You could also use aquarium soil, if you want to improve your plants' health. However, be sure to only use soil made specifically for aquariums.
River pebbles: Above all of the aforementioned substrates, river pebbles are recommended for large predator fish. This is mainly because river pebbles are larger than gravel, and will not be accidentally devoured as easily as small particles.

, When it comes to filling your tank, it can be a real pain in the neck. The easiest way to do it is to simply feed a garden hose through your window and fill your tank that way (note that caution must be taken when doing this because many city water systems contain high levels of chlorine and fluoride; you will have to treat this water before your fish can be put in). A less appealing method is to fill it up bucket by bucket, but with such a large tank, it is not usually a great way to do it.

, When applying your maintenance system, the first thing you will want to hook up is your filter. This will begin the cleansing process and get the water flowing. Once you've done that, set up the bubblers. Make sure the bubblers are spread out evenly. Then, plug in the heater(s) and start warming up the water. Once that is done, go ahead and plug in the lamp.

, Now it's time for some landscaping. Set up the plants and decorations however you like. Note that you may have to make some rearrangements depending on your fishes' behavior (if they like to hide, etc). One thing you should take into account is that if you plan to do live feedings, you should give your fish places to jump out from behind. It's a lot harder to catch your prey when they can see you at all times.

, Once your entire aquarium is up and running, you can start applying dechlorination formula, aquarium salt, or other water enhancers. If you want, you can insert assorted feeders of your choice, so your fish can feast when they arrive in their new home (goldfish, minnows, guppies, or crustaceans like crabs and crayfish). They will also help make the water more ""biological.""

, Before choosing fish, it is always important to do your research. Never purchase a fish on impulse; if the pet store has it now, chances are they'll have it next time you go there. So go ahead and do research at home before purchasing it.


Note: Until you are more experienced in keeping monster fish, try to avoid any member of the Cichlid family, except certain species of bass. Cichlids are very tricky; only South American Cichlids can be kept in a monster fish tank due to size, and they can very quickly become bullies.

, Invert is short for ""invertebrate."" Inverts help clean up the tank, eating mainly debris that falls off your fish, excess food, or unwanted parasites and algae.


Snails: In a large predator tank, snails will be eaten unless they are very large (at least two inches in width). But they can be a very rewarding asset to your aquarium.
Crayfish, crabs and shrimp: Crabs, shrimp, and small crayfish will normally be eaten as well, but if you catch or purchase a large enough crayfish then it will thrive in your tank, and make an interesting addition.
Clams: A third option is freshwater clams. Clams do not do much, in fact they do almost nothing at all. However, they do look quite nice and help the tank look more authentic.

, If you do not know your species well, a good way to classify fish is by paying attention to the way they find food. You never want to have too many of one kind of hunter, or else territorial issues may come up.


Prowlers. An example of a prowler is the silver arowana. The arowana lurks through the water, gracefully slinking around obstacles to catch its prey. Prowlers are very cunning and tend to be smarter than other fish. They tend to stay in the middle or top section of the tank.
Stalkers. An example of a stalker is the spotted gar. The gar lays near the bottom of the tank, dead still, imitating a log or branch. When its unwary prey swims above it, it slowly rises to the top until it is at eye level of the little fish. Before the fish can react––chomp. Stalkers tend to hang around in all sections of the tank.
Ambushers. An example of an ambusher is the clown knifefish. The knifefish stays in its hiding place, waiting for prey to come swimming by. Out of nowhere, it shoots out of its cave and swallows up its food. Ambushers tend to stay in the bottom section of the tank.
Chasers. An example of a chaser is the peacock bass. Chasers are usually the dumbest fish in the tank, using no strategy at all and simply chasing their food. Cichlids are one of them. With many species of bass, this is a successful strategy. However, other cichlids such as Jack Dempseys or Oscars tend to have trouble. Chasers tend to stay in the middle section of the tank.
Bottom-Feeders. An example of a bottom-feeder is the redtail catfish. The redtail catfish wiggles along the bottom of the tank, sucking up scraps with its vacuum-like mouth. Bottom feeders are generally the most peaceful fish in the tank, and prefer not to bother anyone. As you can probably guess, they tend to stay in the bottom section.
Cleaner-Uppers. Cleaner-uppers are basically made up of species of suckerfish. The most common suckerfish kept in large aquariums is the Common Plecostomus, or Pleco. Their bony, spiny, armor-like skin protects them from any fish wanting to pick a fight.

, Here are some possibilities:


Turtles. Yes, keeping turtles and fish together is possible, but tricky. A good way to start is to wait until your fish have grown to full size and are very large, then try adding two medium-sized turtles (with a shell no more than 6 inches wide but no less than 3) and seeing how they do. Most keepers are more successful when they purchase turtles as hatchlings, keep them with other fish that are larger than them but will not eat them (and never feeding the turtles any live food), then when the turtles have grown to full size (after four or five years) then moving them into a large tank with large fish. This way, the turtles are used to being around fish larger than them. However, without enough space, there is no chance that your turtles and fish can live in harmony. Turtles will also need a heat lamp and a log or rock to bask on. One good thing about turtles is that you can catch them wild and keep them as pets and they will have almost no problem adjusting, even if you catch them as adults.
Aquatic salamanders and newts. This family includes Axolotls, Mudpuppies, Sirens, and Hellbenders (all very similar species). None of these animals will ever attempt to harm your fish, although if they are small your fish may try to eat them or will pick on them. Make sure that your aquatic salamander is large enough to be housed with your fish. If you have turtles in the tank, they will most likely attempt to eat your salamander, regardless of size.
African Clawed frogs. Not to be confused with the African Dwarf frog, Clawed frogs are good tank mates for fish because they are entirely aquatic and do not need any land area. Like aquatic salamanders, the main issue is size. Make sure your frog is large enough or he will be killed or injured by your fish. If you have turtles in the tank, they will most likely attempt to eat your frog, regardless of size. Note: African Clawed frogs also tend to have an obesity problem. Be sure not to overfeed.

, It is always good to know your local pet stores. A good way to do it is to search online so you can read reviews and such. Now, just because one or two people write terrible reviews doesn't mean it's a bad store. Many people don't know what they're talking about and often write reviews like this because they're having a bad day themselves. As long as the majority of the people who wrote a review of the place recommend it, it's trustworthy. Make a list of ones you would like to visit, then cross off the ones that received a large amount of bad reviews. Then, visit the pet stores and check things out yourself. If the tanks are dirty, too small, or have more than one dead fish in them (one dead fish doesn't mean much), it's probably not worth the risk of buying fish from there. You can still go back there for supplies if needed, though.


Note: Corporate pet stores like Petco and Petsmart usually don't carry monster fish, and if they do, then they are only available as babies. Local-owned pet stores are often better as far as selection, and they can usually give you more advice and answer more of your questions.

, Once you've got a good idea of which pet stores you like, now it's time to go and purchase your fish. If a fish is acting strangely or looks sick, don't bother buying it. When buying your fish, feel free to chat with the employee about your specific fish (what he's used to being fed, etc). Store workers also may be able to tell you about the personality of your fish (like dogs or cats, not all fish behave according to standards). Once they've caught it and bagged it, pay and bring it home!

, An alternative to buying fish is simply catching them. Most North American game fish can cooperate well with other predator fish, regardless of their country of origin (most freshwater predatory fish are native to the Amazon, however there are others that come from elsewhere). Bass, gars, catfish, salmon, pike, trout, carp, sturgeons, muskies, and walleye can all be kept in a large enough tank with lots of other species. Be aware that these fish, if caught wild, will need to be weaned off live food and will refuse to eat pellets at first. But, with enough perseverance, they will adjust.

, If you simply cannot find a store that has the fish you want, then go ahead and order them from an online breeder. This is usually cheaper than buying from a pet store, but it also costs a lot for shipping (it has to be priority mail or else the fish will die). So you can decide if you'd prefer to order from an online site.

, Once your fish have been brought home/delivered, you will have to condition them. The first thing to do is to get them used to the temperature in the tank. Rapid changes in temperature can force a fish into shock and can kill them.


Since fish come in bags, place the bag in the tank and let it float there. Leave it in there for a while, and the water in the bag will slowly warm up until it's the same temperature as the tank.
Next, get an empty bucket, tear open the bag, and release the fish and water into the bucket. Use a cup to scoop water from the tank and empty it into the bucket. There should be twice as much tank water in the bucket than water from the bag.
Leave your fish in there for a while to let it adjust to the pH, oxygen level, etc.

, If you want, it's sometimes a good idea to feed fish that are already living in your tank. This will make them more lethargic and less irritable when the new fish is introduced. But it isn't really required.

, Now it's time to release the fish into the tank. Catch it out of the bucket with a net. When releasing it, carefully lower the net into the water and let it swim out. Don't just flip the net upside down and allow your fish to fall in. Now, be aware that if other fish already live in the tank, they will start acting crazy when a new fish is introduced. Some fish may hide, others will swim around like maniacs, and some may even bite your new arrival. Do not be alarmed; fish take time to get used to another tank mate and will try to establish their dominance.

, Feeding large predatory fish is a bit more complex than other fish. It's not as simple as sprinkling flakes into the tank and being done with it. Monster fish require a diverse diet in order to be healthy. Their diet should consist of several things:


Peeled shrimp (thawed and not cooked)
Sardines/silversides
Pellet food (if possible)
Live food (only as a treat and for exercise)


Note that most fish, unless they are used to it, will not eat pellets until they are weaned off of raw or live foods. If you plan to buy pellets for any fish (not just monster fish), the brand Hikari is the way to go. Also note that many live feeders available for purchase (guppies, minnows, goldfish, and crustaceans) will often have diseases, so make sure to examine them carefully before buying. When feeding, make sure that all of your fish get their fair share. When a fish is full, its belly should bulge a bit (if they are still growing and you want to speed it up, feed them more frequently and with larger portions). Feed once a day.
Note: Some fish, such as the Burundi Frontosa Cichlid, are nocturnal, and will not normally accept daytime feedings.

, Water changes with large tanks are quite a pain. However, with a strong enough filter and maintenance system, you shouldn't have to do it as often or take as much water. As a bare minimum, it's usually good to do a water change every couple of weeks, and even then only take about 25% of the water and your fish will do just fine.

, The only disease you will probably ever encounter in your aquarium is ich. Yes, that is a real thing. Ich is a bacterial/fungal infection. It can be identified by white spots/red marks on a fish's fins or body. The way it happens is when tiny micro-organisms lay their eggs on a fish's skin, the eggs develop into larvae, and the larvae mature into adults and detach from the fish and go swimming out into the water. Then the cycle repeats and the ""ich"" bugs continue to multiply. Ich is extremely common––it is estimated that every fish tank has at least some degree of ich in it, but fish have developed an immunity to it. However, when their immune systems are weaker (usually when stressed), that's where ich can become a problem. Don't worry, though. Ich is relatively easy to treat, if you start before it gets bad. Just look at your local pet store, and you'll find it.

, One thing that will take time for you to learn is how to identify problems in your tank. Pay close attention to the way your fish behave. If two fish seem to be cramming themselves into the same hiding spot, build a second one and they'll separate. If one of your fish seems to be throwing a fit, it may mean it's hungry. Or, if your fish are very lazy, it could mean that your water has low quality. Try to pay attention to things like this to improve habitat quality.

, Let's face it, you're bound to lose at least one of your fish eventually. Don't fret about it too much. If you find a fish dead, quickly remove it from the tank and dispose of it however you choose. Afterwards, try and do research and attempt to find out why your fish died––it could help you save some of your other fish in the future.

",How to Make Aquarium Setups Stand Out," Look at your fish and the room the tank is in. Think about what is most important in the look of your tank. Do you want to bring out the color of your fish? Maybe you want the tank to bring a certain mood to the room, or perhaps you would rather it match the existing décor in the room.;
, If you don't already have fish, now is the time to choose which ones you would like to have in your finished setup. Consider your level of experience, tank size, and time commitment. If this is your first aquarium, choose hardy community fish that can survive your learning curve. Once you have a few kinds in mind, visit some fish stores and choose which colors and breeds you would like to have in your aquarium, making sure they are compatible tank mates. Hold off on buying them until your aquarium is set up and cycled. Keep the breeds you want in mind when choosing the rest of your tank elements.

, Once decided, get gravel or sand in the color you want to bring out of your fish,or one that reflects the mood you are looking for. Buy about 1 pound for each gallon of water in the tank, you can add less or more until it looks good to you. If you plan on having live plants, make sure you have at least 1"" of gravel on the bottom. Be sure to pick out an appropriate gravel (or sand) for you fish.

, Buy several different types of plants for your aquarium in different shapes and sizes. A variety helps to keep the tank interesting to watch and provides different territories for your fish. Fake plants are easier to take care of, and are better if you're new to aquariums. Live aquatic plants require more care, but can keep the tank cleaner and even provide food and oxygen for your fish.

, Having one main decoration that is larger than everything else can provide a good focal point, but also make sure it won't crowd your tank. Twisted driftwood gives an interesting, natural look to the tank, or you could try a Japanese-inspired statue for an Asian theme. Try to pick something out that compliments your gravel and is functional for your fish. Consider getting a few decorations in different sizes to provide different territories. Decorations that bubble can provide oxygen to your tank, which is important if you don't have another source of oxygen already.

, If one side of your aquarium is going to face a wall, consider attaching a background to it. These simple sheets of plastic can be bought at any pet store, and come printed with beautiful pictures, from undersea plants to deserts. A simple black background will lend a very professional look, hiding cords and tubing and making the colors in your aquarium stand out, especially if you have a lot of plants. If your aquarium is looking a little sparse, a background printed with plants or coral reefs can give the impression of a much lusher environment. Measure your tank before going to the store, and buy a piece at least 1"" longer than your tank to account for uneven edges. When you get home, cut it down to the proper size and tape it to the outside of the back of your aquarium.

, Once your tank has been set up and cycled, you are ready to purchase your fish and add them to the tank. Buy only a few fish at first, and then add the remaining fish a few at a time, with two week intervals. Sit back and enjoy the view, and don't be afraid to make changes and upgrades!

,
Turn your bathroom into an aquarium.",How to Creatively Decorate a Freshwater Fish Tank1," Using an unusual object to house your tank provides it with a lot of character right off the bat. Find an old console TV for a larger tank in your attic or at a thrift store. Or, if you don’t have room for a new piece of furniture, create one out of an older model TV pre-dating flat screens.


Choose your TV based on the requirements of your fish, if you have already chosen which fish you want to include. Check online for guidelines, and make sure to account for the full-grown size of your fish.You will need to gut out the TV components and place a tank inside the shell. Ask your parents or another adult to help you if you aren’t comfortable with cutting tools.
You could also use an old computer monitor for a similar look. Use any substrate, plants, and other decorations you like. You may want to focus on traditional materials to complement the vintage look of the TV. Or mix it up by using more modern, colorful floor materials and decorations.;
, Instead, make your own aquarium in the dimensions you want and top it with a large piece of wood or stone, or a sheet of glass. Make sure to include an opening to feed your fish and include necessary equipment, like a filter.

,, Purchase a pre-made fish tank sink or bathtub/fish tank combo. Fish tank toilets are even available. Get all three, paint your bathroom blue or blue-green, and the whole room will look like a fancy aquarium.


If you are good at carpentry, you may be able to make your own sink aquarium. Follow basic instructions and include space for plumbing features.

Include fish such as rainbow fish, clown loaches, golden panchax or silver sharks.Buy an Asian-themed background for your tank, or create your own by printing and laminating an enlarged photograph.Make sure your Buddha statue is made from natural rocks or polyresin and is not painted.
Buy artificial bamboo to fully submerge, or live “Lucky Bamboo” if you would like a dual under water/above land look. ”Lucky Bamboo” cannot be fully submerged. Make sure the plant’s leaves are above water.Alternatively, you can aquatic friendly plants and mix with dried bamboo sticks to create a bamboo “forest.”Whether bought or made, backgrounds are easy to attach, move, and change. For the most seamless look, make sure to hide any tape or other tools used to attach them to the tank.

, Use quartz sand as your main substrate and include some artificial desert plants or fun natural-looking desert accessories. Make it a specific desert by adding ancient Egyptian decorations, like a pyramid, broken columns, and/or a sarcophagus. Include bright fish to add color to your sandscape, like Firemouth Cichlids or Bengal Danios. Or, find artificial animal skulls and cacti to model a North or South American desert and species found in these waters. Stack objects in the tank so that fish have both places to hide and objects to swim through.
South American fish include Colombian Moon tetras and Buenos Aires tetras, Swordtails, and Blind cave fish.

, If you like science fiction, a space theme might interest you. Choose a substrate like sand or gravel to imitate a distant planet’s surface. Look for accessories like a crashed UFO or alien figurines. Include interesting looking rock formations and a galaxy background. Or, include colorful lights and cover the back with plain black paper.


Buy a floating satellite accessory to introduce a human presence in your outer space scene.Use spray paint and round objects to paint a space scene with nearby planets.Include an artificial ruin to suggest a past alien civilization lived there.

, Use a castle as the main decorative element, preferably one with holes fish can swim through. If you don’t want to buy a big castle, make a background for your tank with a castle scene and add smaller objects to it. Use multicolored rocks as substrate and colorful accessories. Add a fairy or two and maybe even a dragon. Angelfish and tetras look great in this type of environment.To create your own background, find an image you like, enlarge it to the size of your tank, print it off and laminate it.
This theme allows for a wider selection of plants. Pick colorful artificial ones that complement your substrate materials.

Choose your substrate carefully.,
Buy aquarium appropriate plants.,
Follow guidelines when picking out accessories for your theme.",How to Creatively Decorate a Freshwater Fish Tank3," When deciding on a substrate, make sure to consider how healthy it is for the type of fish you have or want, as well as the practical advantages and disadvantages of each type.Eels and rays need sandy floors, for example, since they spend most of their time on the bottom. Avoid adding natural objects unless they have been properly cleaned and sanitized. Generally, you need 1-2” of substrate on the bottom of your tank, but research your individual fish to see what is recommended.Wood, rocks and shells found outside may have minerals that harm fish when leaching into the surrounding water. Any rocks used shouldn’t have sharp edges for fish to cut themselves.
Do not wash gravel or other materials with soap, detergent, or bleach. If not washed out properly, those products can poison a fish. Find a product made to clean non-aquarium specific materials to ensure your fish’s safety.
Sand is harder to clean than rocks or pebbles, especially if you want to perform gravel washes.Glass pebbles are pretty, but do not provide areas for good bacteria to grow on, which can improve the environment for your fish.

, Whether your chosen theme dictates a tank lush with flora or with one plant, using aquatic-friendly live plants adds natural beauty to your aquarium. Live plants look also help sustain healthy water quality in your tank and give them places to hide. They recycle nitrogen from fishes’ waste, keeping water cleaner, keep carbon dioxide levels from becoming toxic and provide oxygen for your fish to breathe.


You will need to pull dead leaves off live plants and watch for decaying matter that periodically falls off.Plastic or silk plants are more colorful and easier to care for, since they can’t die.
Make sure to buy plants specifically made for aquariums. Other hobby plants, like those made for train models, may contain substances that are harmful or toxic for your fish.

, Don’t put any painted objects or anything with sharp corners in your tank.Make sure to include places for fish to hide, but avoid overcrowding your tank or your fish will not have enough swimming room.


If you are using plants too, one or two cool accessories is probably enough.

",How to Decorate an Aquarium,"


Some fish and water-dwelling animals are sensitive to chemicals or paint that could be on some ornaments. Others prefer specific bottom coverings, such as small stones for burrowing and hiding.






For example, fish that originate from shallow bodies of water prefer light covering such as plants, while fish from deep water do best with rocks, wood and sturdy decorations.





;
, Make sure that your ornaments are big enough for the species of fish that you have. Also, check your pieces for sharp corners and rough edges.

,,


Larger items should go toward the sides and back of the tank, while shorter ones look best in the front.
Consider placing a focal point, such as a large rock, plant or ornament with a bubbler, in the center of the aquarium.
Some items might need washed prior to usage. Certain types of ornamentation will need assembled.

,,,


Strategically place items to hide aquarium heaters, tubing and lines for a more attractive look.

Think of your color and design scheme.,
Consider purchasing artificial or real plants.,
Add an underwater structure.,
Make sure to clean your tank often.",How to Pick out the Right Decorations for Your Fish Tank," Know how big your fish tank is and what it can hold while still being a comfortable environment for your fish. Choose a color scheme for tank pebbles that would match well with the colors of the room your tank is in.


It is also important to know what kind of fish you have as different types of fish may enjoy a different environment than another.;
, Not only will plants enhance the decor of your fish tank, they will also serve has a comfort the fish in their ""undersea"" environment. For smaller, long tanks, you will want tall plants at the back with smaller plants near the front.

, Depending on the type of fish, a cave-like structure if often used to hide and rest in.

, A clean and clear tank is very important for the health of your fish, but it is also more appealing to the eye!

Calculate the volume of ammonia required to raise the level in the tank to 2-4ppm.,
Add the required volume of ammonia to the tank.








,
Test the water every 24 hours and wait to see the ammonia reading drop.,
Add more ammonia to raise the level in the tank back up to the level you chose to start with.,
Wait until the nitrite level starts to drop, (they will be sky high for a few weeks) continuing to add ammonia to feed the bacteria in the tank.,
When you have 0ppm of ammonia, 0 ppm of nitrite, and a nitrate reading, your tank is ready for fish.








,
Continue adding ammonia until you add your fish.",How to Do a Fishless Cycle,"






;
,, The level you choose is personal preference. Using 2ppm is not usually problematic during a cycle and is probably more common. Some choose to use a slightly higher level so they can house more stock when complete, but high ammonia can cause a cycle to stall and play catch up sometimes, so keepers must be aware. Use pure ammonia (sometimes called ""janitorial ammonia"". Some household-cleaning ammonia has dangerous chemicals and scents added. It's become harder to find since 9/11 (bomb making) and at a push fish food can be used - a large handful in a stocking - but this is not as accurate to read/dose. There are a few calculators on the web (for example, on the Fish keeping website www.fishkeeping.co.uk or PFK) which require you to know the volume of your tank and the daily ppm of ammonia you have chosen in the tank - very helpful.








,, At this point the filter contains bacteria that break down ammonia into nitrite, so the cycle has commenced. Keeping a cycling diary is recommended so you can plot the changes/patterns emerging.








, Keep testing for ammonia every 24 hours and now test for nitrite too.








, Nitrite is often the most annoying reading as once it drops it will linger at low levels until sometimes just a few days before the end of the full cycle.








,, This will keep the bacteria from dying. Then, do a large water change (70-90%) to get your nitrate under 40ppm. Once the fish are added, continue to test the water for both ammonia and nitrite to ensure that no spikes occur.









Be aware that tank pH can swing around quite a bit during these 4 weeks. Not unusual. Worth keeping an eye on it. If pH falls to 6 or below, this can cause a cycle to stall but there are easy ways to rectify this. A good fish-keeping forum will be able to advise in detail on a bespoke, tank by tank basis.

Try similar styles of plants to continue the theme.",How to Decorate a Fish Tank," Aquarium sand and comes in a variety of colors, and you can choose your favorite as a base for your aquarium. Light colors do well, as they become almost glittery in water. You can also layer different colors, though keep in mind they will get mixed up over time.Another option is a pale tan sand to make your aquarium look like the ocean.
Pick sand for eels, knifefish, and rays. Sand is good for eels because they tend to stay on the bottom. Gravel can cut the eels if it's sharp. Rays need sand because they bury themselves in it. If you have a ray, though, you'll need lots of space for movement, too.However, sand is harder to clean than rocks or gravel. Because it is so fine, you'll often suck it up into the cleaning tube as you clean the tank, though its fineness can also make it easier to pick up dirt off the surface of the sand.;
, Aquarium gravel also comes in a wide variety of colors to add decoration to your tank. You could choose a nice blue to create an ocean-like effect or go for more psychedelic colors like hot pink, yellow, or green. You can also mix colors, as the larger pieces will keep the colors more distinct than sand. In fact, you can purchase gravel that is already mixed. Gravel is a good option for most types of fish, so it's a good option in a wide variety of tanks.Try layering colors for a more interesting effect.
Another option is smooth, round gravel in natural colors, which looks like river rocks.
Medium-sized gravel is the best choice, although small gravel also works.
Don't use large gravel. It can trap things under it, including fish and food.

, Most fish don't actually need a substrate. Therefore, if you don't want to put one in, you can skip it. You may find it aesthetically pleasing to have it, but you may also like the simplicity of leaving it off. It's up to you.Also, skip glass pebbles as a substrate. They can break down and create sharp edges. Additionally, they don't have a large enough surface area to help grow the good bacteria your tank needs., Rocks can add a decorative touch to your aquarium.Choose from rocks such as lava rock, quartz, petrified wood, and slate. You can also use red desert rock, honey onyx, zebra rock, ice rock, or rainbow rock.Dark rocks like lava rock or slate create a more serious tone, while brighter rocks, such as pink quartz, will make it more cheerful. Large rocks that many layers and crevices help give your tank dimension. You can also pick rocks that have natural tunnels in them for your fish to swim through.


You can purchase aquarium rocks at pet stores. However, you can also pick up your own from local areas, as long as you follow a few safety tips first.
Check the rocks for sharp edges. You don't want something that could cut your fish.Make sure to test to see if your rocks are too basic (as opposed to acidic). You can test them one of two ways: 1) Drop a few drops of vinegar on it to see if it foams, or 2) Soak the rocks in water for a few days. Once you've soaked them, test the water to see if it's at the right pH level for your fish.
Also, clean up your rocks. Wash them off, and then be sure to boil any rocks you find for a good 10 minutes to make sure you're not introducing bacteria to your fish.

, Driftwood is reminiscent of the beach, in particular, and it can give your tank an ocean-like natural feel. You can find driftwood along rivers and beaches. You might also catch some while fishing at a lake, as well as purchase it a pet store.Check to make sure there's nothing living in the driftwood before picking it up.
Wash and boil anything you pick up outside before putting it in your fish tank.

, Shells can also add a natural, beach-like feel to your aquarium. Smaller shells make your fish seem bigger in comparison, while using large shells can help you create a theme, such as an underwater mermaid kingdom. For example, you could use large orange or reddish scallop shells to create a mermaid's ""home,"" by opening up the shell and placing a novelty mermaid in the bottom shell. Seashells mostly come in whites, yellows, browns, reds, pinks, and oranges, so keep that in mind when building your color scheme. You can use some mother-of-pearl shells that come in more brilliant colors.You can find shells along the beach. You can also find some shells along rivers and lakes, though it depends on what animal species are living near there. You'll find many stores also sell a variety of shells.Check for animals in the shell before taking it home.
Wash and boil the shells to remove bacteria, and don't use them in in freshwater systems. In freshwater systems, they can add too much calcium or change the pH of the water., Plants can be used to hide away things you'd rather not see, like the filtration system. Make sure you use a variety of plants, as different leaf shapes and plant sizes will add visual texture to your aquarium. Make sure you don't place all the plants at the front, as you'll block the view. Instead, try using them as part of the background in your tank.Live plants can be used in any type of tank, as long as the plant can survive in that type of water. For instance, plants that can survive in freshwater won't make it in saltwater, but you can use coral and algae in saltwater.One problem with live plants is that they will die in time, which may affect the water quality. However, they can add a fresh look to your aquarium.
One benefit of live plants is they consume nitrogen, found in your fish's feces. In addition, they use carbon dioxide and put off oxygen, helping your fish breathe.You can buy aquatic plants and coral at most pet stores.

, While plastic plants may not sound that appealing, many of today's products can actually look quite lifelike. Like live plants, you can use plastic plants to hide your filtration system. You might also try some plants that are about mid-height in the center of the aquarium. Smaller plants can go around rocks and other items.Just make sure you buy plants that are approved for fish tanks. You don't want to place something in the tank that could harm your fish., Most pet stores sell novelty items to add to your tank. You can find anything from treasure chests to plastic divers and mermaids. These items are great for creating a particular feel. You can make your tank feel like the bottom of the ocean with a pirate ship and treasure chest, which also adds a sense of adventure. You could create a fantastical world with tiny fake squid, mermaids, and other fantastical novelty items you can find.Many of these items pertain to an ocean theme, so your choices may be a little limited.
Choose items that are made for fish tanks, as other plastics may leach over time.

, Ceramic pieces can add an artistic touch to the aquarium, as they can be painted in a wide variety of patterns. You can use ceramic pieces to create a color theme or set a certain mood because they come in so many different styles and colors.Try bright Mexican-style pieces for flair and color. You could even pick pieces that have a nautical theme. Add a few plates at the back as a backdrop to your tank or a vase on its side for fish to swim in and out of.
For a bit of class and whimsy, consider a few mismatched teacups and saucers or even a whole teapot if your tank is big enough.
Mugs and other similar dishes can also create hiding places for your fish. You can purchase ceramic pieces at almost any big box store or decorating store.
However, you should check to make sure your pieces are safe. Any unglazed ceramic piece is fine. If it's glazed, it should be labeled ""food safe,"" ""dinnerware safe,"" or be sold as dinnerware. If it's safe for you to eat off of, it should be safe for the aquarium.

, Another option that you can do for free is to upcycle old jars or bottles. Pick bright colors, like green or blue, which help create a beach-like feeling, as they're reminiscent of beach glass. Clean them out thoroughly, and remove the label. Make sure you get all the glue off. Then you can set the jar on i's side in the aquarium, making another place for the fish to play in.
Glass is best because it won't leach chemicals.
Try a blue or green jar, which will add color to the aquarium.

, Backgrounds are pieces of plastic that cling to the back of your aquarium. Try a solid color for a clean look. You can also pick background that look like ocean water or sand, for a beach feel.You can find backgrounds at the pet store.
Another option is to create your own background. You could buy a canvas or a sheet of paper that is the same size as the backside of your aquarium. Paint or draw a picture on it, then tape it or attach it to your aquarium. Use the background to tie the theme together.

, Use the area around the fish tank to keep your theme going. If you've created an underwater adventure with a pirate ship and treasure chest, add pieces outside the tank that fall into the theme, such as bowl of gold coins, a pirate's hat, or small wooden statue like a ship's mast.Alternatively, if you've played up mermaids, try adding similar touches outside the tank, such as a small mermaid's tail or a shell bra.
You could also use the same decorations to carry the theme. For instance, if you use slate rocks in your tank, use a few pieces outside the tank, as well., Whatever colors you've touched on in your tank, continue it outside the tank. For example, if you've focused on pinks and reds, pick those colors up on the shelves around the tank. You could use vases, candles, knickknacks, or even books to pick up the same colors.You could also use colors that tie into the colors of your fish or coral, such as brightly colored rocks or even fake flowers.

, Another option is use plants to carry your theme outside the tank. Obviously you won't be able to use the exact same plants, unless you use fake ones, but if you use plants that have a similar shape or leaf, you'll help draw the aquarium into the room's decor."

Get the right fish.,
Use corals (generally soft corals, which are like masses of little anemones without much of a sting) and macroalgae that do not require a lot of light.,
Make the aquarium colorful with a lot of macroalgae and soft corals and relatively few animals that move such as fish and shrimp.,
Circulate the water vigorously everywhere in the aquarium to let the live rock and sand filter it biologically, to keep material from building up and rotting anywhere, and to keep food suspended so the fish will have a long time to see and eat it with little waste.,
If the corals are open and growing well, the water quality is probably fine.,
Make sure the aquarium has a protein skimmer.,
Don't make your filter-feeders fight the machine - put it on a timer!,
Clean the glass with a magnetic cleaner from the outside.,
An entirely plastic-bodied heater greatly reduces the risk of heater breakage.",How to Reduce Saltwater Reef Aquarium Maintenance," Cheap fish, invertebrates, corals and macroalgae are better for an aquarium and for the environment. They're cheap because they reproduce well in captivity or are plentiful in the wild and tend not to die on the way to the pet store. Also, get little fish that stay fairly little. They're as pretty and usually as interesting as big ones, but metabolize much less. Half the length means one-eighth the volume and mass--and while smaller animals are usually more active for their size, they're still much less of a handful to care for. They'll also have room to swim and stake out little territories comfortably.;
, High-powered light consumes more energy than anything else in the aquarium. It encourages the growth of hair and other microalgae, and coralline algae which, while colorful, requires hard scraping with a metal tool, generally by reaching inside the aquarium, to remove. It produces heat which can require a chiller to remove from the aquarium and more air conditioning to remove from the house.


The light should still be brighter than a typical freshwater aquarium. One to two watts per gallon (one of the two ballasts for U-tube lights).
Read reviews online about this product there has been some problems experienced.

, (Some hermit crabs and snails are worthwhile for eating microalgae and stirring the sand.) If it doesn't move, it doesn't produce much waste. Algae actually cleans the water.

, Arrange the rocks into a loose open pattern. Directing one water jet such as the filter exhaust along one side of the tank and slightly inward so that the water spins in a slow vortex and another toward the otherwise stagnant center is a good start. Add a power head as necessary.


Saltwater fish, unlike freshwater fish, are generally used to keeping position in waves and are not upset by vigorous water movement.

, It is a good idea to change some of the water from time to time - perhaps 20% every other week, or 10% every week.


Replacing a mechanical-filter cartridge more often might be a good idea. But a big protein skimmer is perhaps even more effective in removing organic sludge.
Always top off (i.e., when no saltwater is removed) with fresh water. Salt water would over-concentrate, like the Dead Sea! Dechlorinate it first. In some areas with high levels of other impurities, or especially sensitive aquarium residents, reverse osmosis, deionized, distilled or otherwise purified water can best avoid adding copper and other harmful minerals to the tank.

, This removes undesirable material, including suspended algae, from the water so it does not dirty the water as it rots. Hang it on the front if you have to, such as for a nano-reef tank. A length of air line tubing from the air intake can muffle it greatly; ideally the opening should be above the water level so no malfunction can start siphoning water out of the aquarium.


Adding the air line will change the water level in the skimmer; be prepared to adjust the skimmer so the water doesn't rise too high and spill out of the aquarium. The author has had success with a big coral life 60 gallon (227.1 L) skimmer on a 29 gallon (109.8 L) nano-reef.
A large amount of macroalgae, live rock, and live sand is a great bio-chemical filter.

, Filter-feeders let their morsels come to them - slowly. If a mechanical filter (like many micro-reef rear compartments) will stay wet, keeping its bacteria alive, when it is turned off, you can put it on the lighting timer so it only comes on at night. In any event put the protein skimmer, whose recirculating area doesn't have room for bacteria to build up and die, on the timer to come on at night only. But always there should be something moving the tank's water, such as a powerhead. This keeps the food (and tiny particles into which the pumps shred it) moving enticingly so the fish will have several minutes to hunt it, the corals and other stationary inverts will have all day to filter-feed and dangle at it, and the crabs and snails will have all day to pick up the particles that do manage to settle to the bottom. It also keeps the live rock and sand biologically filtering the water. Then the protein skimmer will remove it at night before it rots very much and the filters will make the water very clean at night.

Some wet-dry filters do not include (or can be used without) a mechanical filter such as a sponge. They can constantly aerate and bio-chemically filter water well without removing particulates too efficiently. Their constant operation might be more important for big fish.

, This works best if the lights are not extremely bright so the glass will have little coralline algae on it.


Small basically-toothless carnivorous fish such as clownfish will tend to eat little nuisance bugs that can damage coral.

, Heater capacity should be on the low side because the lights and pumps create some heat and low temperatures from a cold house or insufficient heater capacity are less likely to kill the fish than excessive temperatures from a powerful heater stuck on.

Wash your hands.",How to Clean Aquarium Decorations," You may be in a hurry to get your tank looking fresh, but never clean all of your decorations at once. Decorations are home to helpful bacteria that keep your fish healthy. Removing them all at once can upset the balance of your aquarium.Removing all of the decorations at once is stressful for your fish, too.
Keep your fish in the tank. There’s no need to remove them when cleaning parts of the tank.
Wash your hands with warm water and soap before you reach into the fish tank. Make sure you’ve rinsed all of the soap off your hands. Soap is terrible for fish and can kill them.;
, If you keep live plants in your tank, you don’t need to remove them. Plants naturally keep themselves clean. Simply move them to one corner of the tank so you can see and clean everything else.You can replace the old live plants with new ones if you want to change your aquarium’s look.
Live plants are an excellent way to help enhance the health of an aquarium, since they work as a natural filter.

, Gravel is the most common decoration, and can become covered in algae over time. If you want to spruce it up, use a special gravel vacuum. The gravel vacuum will suck up water and gravel when you stick it into the gravel.Never clean all of the gravel at once.
As the gravel gets sucked into the tube, the pressure will tumble the gravel and clean it.
The gravel will then fall back out of the vacuum to the bottom of the tank.
This will remove some dirty water from the tank. You will need to replace it with dechlorinated water when you are done cleaning the decorations.

, Make sure the pot is large enough to hold one or more decorations at a time. This can be regular tap water. Do not add anything to it, such as soap or chlorine., Once the water has boiled, place one or two decorations into the pot. Let them soak for about 20 minutes. This should kill a majority of the algae and make the decorations easier to clean.Your decorations should be able to withstand the temperature of the boiled water. If they melt or fall apart, they should be thrown away.
Take the water off of the heat before soaking the decorations.

, You can now remove the decorations from the pot and scrub them with the bristles of a toothbrush. The algae should come off relatively easily.Use a toothbrush that is specifically dedicated to your aquarium. It should not be used to clean anything else, or you may contaminate your aquarium.
If your decorations appear clean after this step, you can move on to putting them back in the tank.

, This step is not always necessary. However, if you want to make sure you’ve removed all algae, you may want to clean the decorations with a bleach solution as well.Your solution should be 5% bleach and 95% water. A handy recipe to use is 4 teaspoons of bleach to 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water.
This water can be cool or warm, but should not be hot. Hot water can deactivate bleach.

, Let it sit for about 5 minutes. After this, your decoration should be clean and free from any remaining algae.Never bleach aquarium gravel or rocks. This will disrupt the health of your aquarium, because they may absorb the bleach.
Always use bleach in a well ventilated area. The fumes can be dangerous. If your eyes burn or run due to the fumes, you’re using too much bleach and do not have enough ventilation.
Wearing rubber gloves is advisable when working with bleach. It may irritate or dry out your skin.

, Use the same toothbrush that you used earlier. Scrub the decoration to remove any remaining visible algae. Make sure to turn the decorations over and scrub all sides to prevent future algae buildup.Rinse the bleach solution off of the toothbrush when you’re done. You can simply run it under the tap for minute to do this.

, Once you’ve scrubbed each decoration, run it under cool water for a minute or two. This will remove any remaining bleach.Do not dry the decorations off after rinsing them. This is unnecessary.

, This should be a fresh, clean bucket. Fill it up with enough tap water to cover the decorations. The water should be warm but not hot.Most tap water contains some chlorine. Your local pet store should have information about the chlorine content of your city’s tap water.
You can purchase dechlorinating tablets at your local pet store. Follow the directions on the packaging to make sure you’re using them properly.

, Allow the decorations to soak for about 20 minutes. You want to make sure that all of the chlorine and bleach are removed from the decorations. These chemicals can be deadly for fish.Porous decorations such as driftwood will absorb the dechlorinated water, which will then become part of the aquarium’s water. This is part of why it’s very important to make sure the final soak is done in dechlorinated water.
You can give your decorations a quick rinse under tap water after dechlorinating.

, Your decorations are now safe to put back into the tank. You can place them in the tank in new locations if you like. If any of the decorations seem to be disintegrating or falling apart, they should be discarded.You can always add new decorations or rotate decorations to give your aquarium a new look.
Replace the decorations one at a time. You don’t want to stress your fish out by radically changing their environment again.

, If you moved the live plants while you cleaned the decorations, you can now put them back. Make sure your hands are clean when you reach into the tank. Simply move the plants to a new place in the tank.You may need to bury the plants’ roots in the gravel to hold them down.

, Always wash your hands after reaching into a fish tank. Use soap and warm water. The water from a fish tank isn’t dangerous, but it does contain bacteria and waste.

Choose well-behaved, hardy fish for a regular tank.",How to Start a Saltwater Reef Tank," You should determine the correct size tank by considering your level of experience, as well as the fish you want to keep. Research the tank size requirements for the specific fish and corals you want to keep. Consider your level of experience with the hobby. Pick a tank size that you are comfortable maintaining and that is large enough for the organisms you want to keep.Tanks range in size from nano (20 gallons) to large (300 gallons).
If you are a beginner, consider getting a 120 gallon tank.Different kinds of fish require different size tanks, so you should inquire into the correct size tank for the type of fish you want to keep.If you only have space for a tank of four feet or less, you should consider getting fish that can live in smaller tanks, like clownfish, banggai cardinal fish, orchid dottyback, royal gamma or blue green chromis.;
, When shopping for a fish tank, try to pick one that has as much depth as it does height. Consider the challenge of cleaning the fish tank when decide on a particular shape. The shape of the tank should also be considered in relation to the style and decoration of the tank, as well as the location of the tank in your home.Avoid tall, narrow tanks. The ratio of surface area to volume can lead to challenges with both cleaning and decorating the tank.
A good shape to start with is 48’’ by 18’’ by 18’’ (65 gallons).

, You should take the size, shape and weight of the tank into consideration. Check to make sure the floor will be able to hold the weight of the tank. Make sure there are electrical outlets in close proximity to the tank. A spot close to a sink is also a good idea.You may need to contact a professional to determine whether your floor can handle the weight of a reef tank.Saltwater reef tanks weigh approximately eight to twelve pounds per gallon.

, Put the tank on the tank stand. Fill the tank with water. Look for leaks in the tank. If there are leaks, it is easier to return the tank before you put all of the rocks, corals and fish in it.Once you have tested for leaks, you can empty the tank.

, Place a level on the top of the tank. Look at the bubble vial on the level. If the bubble is not centered in the vial, you could use some foam shims underneath the tank to get it level., Unless you live in a coastal area and have access to clean salt water, you will need to make your own. For this purpose, you will need a synthetic sea salt mix. You can purchase synthetic sea salt mix from an aquarium or pet store. Ask the retailer how much sea salt mix you will need for your tank., You should pour dechlorinated tap water or reverse osmosis water into the tank. Then, put the salt mix into the tank. Stir the salt into the water. Finally, fill the tank all the way to the top with water.If you are not sure how to mix in the salt, check on the back of the package for the directions., Use your hydrometer to check the specific gravity of the tank. The specific gravity is the weight per unit of liquid compared to water.If you are using a standard hydrometer, place the hydrometer in the water. Read the number on the instrument to determine the specific gravity.A good range for specific gravity is between 1.021 and 1.026.If the gravity is too high, remove some of the tank water and put in some fresh water.
If the gravity is too low, add some more salt mix.

, Keep your tank below 80 Fahrenheit (26 Celsius). You can use an aquarium heater that allows you to adjust the temperature. In very hot weather, you can cool the water and increase oxygen in the tank by increasing the water movement., Use powerheads and water returns to get water moving in the tank. It is best if the water movement is complex, as opposed to unidirectional. The corals in your tank will depend on the movement of water to breathe and eat, since they are unable to move., Purchase and set up the lighting for your fish tank. When choosing lighting, you want to choose lights that have enough blue spectrum light and not too much red or yellow. You also want to make sure the lighting does not overheat your aquarium. It should be strong enough to reach the organisms at the bottom of the tank.You can place the tank somewhere with a few hours of natural light as long as it isn’t so much light that the tank experiences overheating. If the tank goes above the normal temperature range for the species in the tank, you will know it is overheating. A good normal range is 76 to 80 Fahrenheit (25-27 Celsius)., Start by installing an overflow, which will continuously remove the top surface of water from the tank. Then, consider biological filtration through the use of a trickle filter and/or live rock., Live rock helps with the filtration and quality of the water in your aquarium. It consists of all kinds of beneficial bacteria and algae, which will help to filter the water in your aquarium. Live rock is obtained from rubble zones just outside of coral reefs. You can purchase it from aquarium retailers.Avoid purchasing live rock that has live organisms such as sea fans, which indicates that the rock has been plundered from a coral reef illegally.
When you purchase live rock, you should find out how it was transported. The better retailers will ship the live rock submerged in water., First, remove all of the sponges and algae from the outside of the live rock. Then, place the live rock in an unlit, filtered tank for one month. By seeding the rock in this manner, you can get rid of fouling organisms and encourage the growth of good algae and bacteria. At the end of the month, the live rock will be ready to put in your reef tank., Place the live rock directly on the bottom of the tank, rather than ontop of the sand. Arrange the live rock into the patterns and shapes that you desire. Be careful not to put the live rock too close to the walls of the tank, since it will make the tank a lot harder to clean.When arranging the live rock, you should consider water circulation between the rocks. It is best to make loose arrangements with lots of space between the rocks.It is easier to arrange long, flat shaped live rock, which can be easily stacked.The live rock should take up approximately one third of the space in your aquarium., If you choose smaller grain sizes, the sand may trap gas. If you choose larger sizes, it can trap detritus., Fill a five gallon bucket half way up with sand. Then pour tap water into the bucket. Swirl the bucket around. Pour out the dirty water., Choose either a shallow or a deep bed of sand. A shallow bed is two inches or under, whereas a deep bed is over four inches. Some people prefer the look of a shallow sand bed, but it is up to you.You should avoid a bed that is between two and four inches, since this can lead to algae blooms.
You can also mix in some “live” sand, which has beneficial bacteria.

, Before deciding which corals and fish to keep, you should consider the home or “biotope.” When you make a saltwater reef tank, you are basically reproducing a particular biotope, such as a tropical or Atlantic biotope. Once you know the biotope you are recreating in your tank, you can choose the fish and corals that occupy this type of biotope.A biotope is a region that is relatively consistent in environmental conditions and home for particular plants and animals.For instance, you could focus on the tropical western Atlantic reef habitat. This reef habitat can be found in the natural environment, from Northern Brazil all the way up to the Florida Keys., If you are new to saltwater reef tanks, it is best to stick to one type of coral. The type of coral you choose will determine the lighting you need for your tank.You will need to research the particular types of coral you purchase, so that you get the correct lighting set up for that type of coral.
For instance, you should choose Power Compact lights for soft corals in a 24-inch deep tank.If you choose large polyp stony corals, you may want to choose HO or VHO fluorescent lights., Although it is possible to mix soft and hard corals, it is very difficult to accomplish with much success. If you are a beginner or simply want to avoid the risk, it is best to avoid mixing hard and soft corals., You want to purchase fish that will not harm your coral or, in other words, are “reef safe.” If you go to a fish store, they should have these fish labeled “reef safe.” It is also a good idea to ask friends and hobbyists for advice on a appropriate varieties. If you purchase tangs, you will need a big, long tank., There are plenty of exotic fish available for saltwater reef tanks, but many exotic fish require large tanks and specialized diets. For a regular sized tank (10-55 gallons) and less intensive feeding requirements, choose a hardy, well-behaved, reef safe fish:Banggai cardinalfish
Orchid dottyback
Royal gamma
Blue green chromis
Firefish
Six line wrasse
Clownfish raised in a tank
Watchman goby
Midas blenny
Carpenter’s wrasse

One is by pre-made saltwater or getting a synthetic sea salt mix that you blend into the water. If you plan to mix your own saltwater, make sure you purchase the pre-made saltwater solution that you add to water that you supply.Get a dry synthetic saltwater mix. These generally come in tubs of 10 or 22 kilograms or 22 or 48 pounds. You’ll need a larger container for bigger aquariums and a smaller tub for smaller aquariums. Keep in mind that even if you have extra, you can use the product to mix future batches of saltwater.
Make sure you use a quality, reputable synthetic sea salt mix such as Instant Ocean or Reef Crystals.;
, Just as your sea salt mix is important, so is the water for the saltwater aquarium. You can use tap water for a fish-only aquarium but need a different water source for reef aquariums.It is ideal to use reverse osmosis and/or deionized water (RO/ DI) for fish-only and reef aquariums.Be aware that you should only use tap water if its quality is excellent. It should be free of petroleum, organic compounds such as animal manure, or other chemicals introduced by humans' activities.You’ll also need to dechlorinate and dechlorinate tap water before you blend it with the sea salt mixture. You can get products that remove chlorine and chloramines, such as Dr.Tim’s Aquatics Aqua Cleanse, at fish supply and some pet stores.Purchase RO/ DI water at a fish or pet supply store. If you are interested, you can also purchase a system that produces RO/ DI water., Water and a sea salt mixture are the most important elements of blending saltwater for your aquarium. You’ll need a few more supplies to ensure that the aquarium is safe for your fish and/ or corals. Make sure you have the following supplies before you start mixing your saltwater:Clean bucket or heavy-duty plastic storage bin
Submersible aquarium heater
Floating or battery-powered thermometer
Small submersible powerhead or pump for water circulation
Refractometer or hydrometer for measuring specific gravity/ salinity, which is how salty the water is
Stirring tool

, Before your fill your container with the water, make sure to rinse it with tap water. This can ensure there are no substances in the container that could contaminate your saltwater.Avoid using any detergent when you rinse the container. These can cause harm to the life in your aquarium. When you’re done, place the container next to your aquarium so it is easier to fill or refill the water.

, Figure out how much water you need in your aquarium, which you can do by checking its size. Fill the container with either tap or RO/DI water in the amount that will work for your aquarium.Avoid filling the container to the top because the salt mix will displace some of the water. Then fill the aquarium with enough of the mixed water to leave room for things such as splashing from the fish, turbulence from the filter, and other animals like snails, which lay their eggs on the top of the water., Add your thermometer to the mixing container in a place where you can easily monitor it. This will help ensure that the temperature in the mixing container is the same as in your aquarium, which can also keep your fish and coral healthy.Measure the temperature of your aquarium before putting it in the mixing container. Note the aquarium temperature on a piece of paper so that you don’t forget it.

, Set the powerhead and the heater near the bottom of your mixing container. This can help dissolve the salt more quickly so that you can put it in the aquarium.Make sure the heater temperature is set to the same level as the one currently in your aquarium. The target temperatures you should have are: 72-80 degrees Fahrenheit for fish-only tanks, and 75-78 degrees Fahrenheit for those with reefs.
Look to see that the powerhead is creating some turbulence at the water’s surface to maximize gas exchange. If it is not, reposition the powerhead until you see light turbulence at the surface., Now that the water is in the mixing container, it’s time to add the sea salt. It’s important to read the packaging instructions before you add the mixture so that you don’t put too much the water. Slowly add the salt mixture to your water as you stir it.Note the manufacturers’ instructions. They will direct you to use a certain number of pounds of sea salt mixture per gallon of water. You want to ultimately aim for a specific gravity of about 1.025 or a salinity of 35ppt.
Add the sea salt mixture in three separate batches. Put in the first batch and stir until it dissolves completely. Then you can add the second batch and blend until the salt dissolves. Finish by adding the third batch of sea salt and mix it until it completely dissolves., Once you’ve added the three batches of sea salt mixture, it’s important to test the specific gravity of the water with the hydrometer or refractometer. This will let you know if you’ve added too much or too little sea salt mixture.Watch for the salinity/ specific gravity to be between the levels of 1.020 and 1.024. If the level is below 1.020, add more salt until you reach the desired specific gravity. If the level is above 1.024, add more water until you reach the desired specific gravity., Before you add the saltwater to your aquarium, allow it to sit at least 24 hours. This can ensure that the salt is completely mixed into the water and that the water achieves proper oxygen/ carbon dioxide equilibrium.Leave the powerhead in the container so that it can aerate the water properly. This will help the water achieve proper oxygen/ carbon dioxide equilibrium. You should also leave the thermometer in the container.

, After you’ve allowed the saltwater mixture for at least 24 hours, it’s important to check the salinity/ specific gravity again. This can alert you to potential imbalances that need adjusted.Adjust the specific gravity levels until they reach the optimal level of 1.020 to 1.024. Add more salt if they are too low and more water if they are too high.

, Just as salinity is important to the wellbeing of your fish, so is the water temperature. Once you’ve tested and adjusted the specific gravity, check the water temperature. It should be the same temperature as the water in your aquarium.Keep heating it if the temperature is too low. Remove the heater and keep checking the temperature until it reaches the optimal range of 72-75 degrees Fahrenheit for fish only and 75-78 degrees Fahrenheit for reef systems.
Be aware that adding salt water at a different temperature than your aquarium will cause a change in temperature for your aquarium. This could harm the health of your fish.

, When all of the water levels are optimal, you can begin adding the new saltwater to the aquarium. Make sure to add the water slowly so that it doesn’t shock any fish or other life in the aquarium. Keep checking the temperature and salinity of the water to ensure the levels remain stable.


Add your fish back to the aquarium once it is filled to the appropriate level. You may want to consider double checking the salinity and temperature before adding the fish if you are concerned.

Install aquarium tank, base, and lighting: Set up a mid-size to larger sized aquarium such as 50 gallons to 150 gallons (200 liters to 560 liters).,
Install rocks, gravel, and synthetic sea water.,
Build or Install a wet-dry filter for biological filtration that has a volume of 1 gallon per 50 gallons of aquarium (3.78 liters per 190 liters of aquarium volume).,
Install a medium to large sized canister filter with a high flow rate; some have a built-in UV sterilizer which may be helpful.,
After one month of running the aquarium with biological filter, you can add new fish, at a rate of about one fish per month; each time also add an anti-parasitic agent, and use the aquarium divider for three days.,
Add top-off dechlorinated fresh water as needed to maintain the aquarium water level.,
Give vitamins to the fishes: Soak fish food in vitamins before feeding, a few times per week.,
Increase the mechanical filtration by installing several powerheads with sponge filters inside the aquarium, and every week remove, rinse, and re-install the sponges.,
Use a nitrate and phosphate reduction system that is carbon-dosing based, together with a protein skimmer.,
Add a bacterial clean-up additive weekly.,
Add buffer to the aquarium weekly by first mixing it with top-off water.,
Add a small amount of a mild herbal anti-parasitic agent weekly.,
After the third month from initial set up, and then once per month, move only half of the rocks and stir up only half gravel of the aquarium, let the water settle, and after 10 minutes remove, rinse, and replace the sponges on the powerheads, and lastly replace the rocks.",How to Keep Saltwater Fish Without Doing Water Changes,"



An in-tank wet-dry filter behind a false wall in the main aquarium is recommended, but you may have to build it: using a container, powerhead, and air pump. You can hide it behind rocks stacked or glued with epoxy to the front of the container.
Since an in-tank wet-dry filter will consume some aquarium water volume and take up some space, the aquarium should be sized a little larger: for example choose a 75 gallon (283 liters) tank instead of 55 gallon (208 liters) tank, which will add only 3 inches (7.6 cm) of depth usually. A section below has more discussion on wet-dry filter choices.
This set up will not be a FOWLR (Fish Only with Live Rock) system. The rock recommended is dead rock, (which may become living rock over time). The rock you use will not be an important part of the filtration system, because it is inefficient as a filter.




 DIY base before covering

Be sure the base is very strong and can support the weight of tank, water, and rocks. For a 75 gallon (283 liters) acrylic tank, this weight (all included) is about 800 lbs (362 kg). Most buildings can support this weight, but it is best to place the aquarium in a corner near load bearing walls.




 DIY base after covering

The weight is spread over a few square feet/meters. Compare to a bed with two adults that might weigh 400 lbs (185 kg).
Acrylic tanks are much lighter than glass tanks, but acrylic is more expensive and does scratch more easily. However, acrylic tanks will almost never leak, and scratches in the inside are usually hard to see because of the water inside.
Get everything positioned exactly the way you want it, because after you add rocks, gravel, and water, it will be impossible to move the aquarium tank or stand unless you drain and empty the tank again.;
,


For the initial set up, when there are no fish yet in the aquarium:
Rinse rocks first in tap water, and then place any large rocks you will use into the aquarium, because they will take up volume. Lace rock or lava rock are recommended.
Rinse gravel first in tap water, unless it is crushed coral with bacterial starter. Then spread gravel you will use into the aquarium before adding water, because it will take up volume. Crushed coral or dolomite gravel substrate works well. The gravel should only be 1 inch (2.54 cm) deep, and not placed under the rocks.
An example live gravel product that includes live biological filtering bacteria (again, do not rinse before use) is: CaribSea Arag-Alive Hawaiian Black. Black gravel can look very exotic.
You can buy sea water from a fish store, or mix your own synthetic seawater. Using sea water collected directly from the ocean near cities is not recommended because it usually has a lot of harmful bacteria that must be sterilized before use.
To mix a batch of synthetic sea water: in a separate container, add water (the water used can be tap water because we are not setting up a reef aquarium), and add conditioner/dechlorinator (usually a very small amount, see product instructions); an example product is: Seachem Prime. Then add synthetic sea salt, and mix well for about ten minutes. Check after ten minutes to see if all the salt mix is dissolved, and mix again if needed. A premium reef sea salt is not needed, and an example salt mix product is: Instant Ocean Sea Salt.
Add the prepared synthetic sea water to the aquarium using a bucket.
Never add sea salt directly to the aquarium; always mix it first with dechlorinated water in a separate container.
Add a small amount of fish food daily to the empty aquarium to feed the bacteria.
Install a thermometer and heater, and set the heater to 76° F (24.4° C).
It is recommended to wait one month before adding the first fish. If you add fish sooner than one month, then add a small amount of water conditioner, such as Seachem Prime or AmGuard, directly to the aquarium daily for the first week.

,


An in-tank or hang-on-back wet-dry filter is much easier to install and maintain, and almost impossible to leak compared to a main tank with a sump.
An in-tank wet-dry container at 1 gallon size would be 231 cubic inches, and might be 3"" deep x 7"" high x 11"" wide. (in metric: 3.78 liters is 3780 cc, sized at 7.6 cm x 17.8 cm x 27.8 cm). Usually two units are needed for mid size to large sized tanks.
Setting up the wet-dry filter should be done at the same time the aquarium is initially set up, because it takes about one month for it to start working effectively.
Use a high capacity biological media such as sintered glass or fired ceramics; for example, use Eheim SUBSTRAT Pro, or CerMedia MarinePure Biofilter Media.
For most wet-dry filters, using an air pump to inject air will increase its effectiveness.
After installation or building, add a biological filter bacteria; example products are Seachem Stability, or API Quick Start. Stability is to be added daily for the first week.
To make:






Obtain a plastic container with an open top that is about 1 gallon (4 liters) in volume.
Make notches at the top of the container, to allow water to enter, by melting the plastic with a soldering iron instead of cutting it.
Install a pump or powerhead with a sponge pre-filter at the bottom of the container to pump water back to the tank using an output spray bar. The pump should be rated at about 265 gallons per hour (1000 liters per hour). An example pump is the Eheim Compact 1000.
Install a plastic separator plate with gaps around the edges above the pump.
Install an air pump that supplies several air-stones above the separator plate. Put the air pump below the aquarium, and use a check value in the air line to prevent leaks.
Place high capacity biological media above the air-stones to fill the container. Never clean the biological media, but once every three months: clean the intake sponge, plate, container, and pump, and also change the air stones.
Conceal the filter with rocks placed in front of, or glued with epoxy to the front of the containers.
It is recommended to make two such units (two containers with two powerheads) for a 75 gallon (283 liter) or larger sized aquarium.


More ideas on a wet-dry filter:

See the ""Uniquarium"" for an example of a commercial system in mid to large sizes that includes a built-in wet-dry behind a false wall.
Smaller sized aquariums that include wet-dry filters are good for nano-reefs, but are too small for fish that need swimming space such as Tangs or Angels; examples of nano-reef tanks are CoralLife BioCube and JBJ.
Hang-on-back filters could be modified to have a wet-dry action by air injection using an air pump. An example unit is the Hagen AquaClear 110, or Fluval C4 Power Filter. For this how-to, use about 3 units giving a total volume of about 2 gallons (7.6 liters).
In a tidal action wet-dry filter, the water level goes up and down in a cycle rather than dripping or spraying onto the media, like tide pools in the ocean. It is quieter and may be more effective than spray or drip systems. An example is the Eheim 2227/2229 series or a similar design.
A sump is not recommended because it is essentially a second tank with a lot of plumbing; it is usually complicated and adds cost, and it can overflow in some cases. Also, maintenance for a sump and all the equipment in it usually requires you to crawl around under the main aquarium tank.


The wet-dry filter is the most important life support filter of the aquarium. It should be as large as possible, because there will be oxygen demand not only from the fish population, but also from several strains of bacteria that will keep the aquarium clean and in balance:

Nitrifying bacteria, that convert fish waste (mainly ammonia) to nitrate (two strains, that take one month to grow to an effective amount).
Nitrogen fixing and denitrifying bacteria, that convert nitrate to nitrogen gas or bind the nitrate in a film (the film is then removed when you clean the filter and aquarium) (these bacteria take about two months to grow, and are fed by carbon dosing).
Clean-up or facultative bacteria, that remove fish waste and uneaten food from the water.



,


The main purpose of the canister filter is to operate a surface skimmer intake and spray bar output.




 floating comb intake

Install a surface comb intake for a canister filter input. This removes the thin film of organic compounds (which usually float) that blocks oxygen from getting into the water.




 spray bar output from wet-dry is at surface water level

Install spray bars for a canister output near the top of the water surface to agitate the aquarium water surface slightly. This greatly improves the oxygen level in the water.
Output from the spray bar should be strong. Weak output may indicate:

The filter media is dirty or intake sponge is dirty. Clean filter sponges every three months. Do not use fine filter wool; it will clog very quickly as you add more fish.
The pump impeller may need to be cleaned. Check for and remove any debris, sand, or gravel near the impeller magnets.
Impeller magnets can loose magnetism over time from heat and usage, and may need to be replaced.








If the aquarium is more than three feet (1 meter) long, add a second spray bar from a powerhead or canister filter.
A canister wet-dry pump with tidal action is the Eheim 2229, which is not manufactured anymore. However, you can build your own tidal action wet-dry filter.

 Blue Tang

You can stock up to about 1"" of fish length per 2 gallons (2.54cm per 7.6 liters); for example 30"" of fish for a 75 gallon aquarium (7"" Naso tang, 5"" sailfin tang, 5"" blue tang, 4"" yellow tang, 2"" flame angel, 2"" coral beauty, 5"" flagfin angel. These fish were added the the 75 gallons aquarium over about a year).
It is recommended to stock the aquarium with plant-eating fish such as tangs (surgeonfish), which are easy to care for.
The aquarium divider allows the new fish to get used to the new aquarium without being attacked by the other fish already in the aquarium.

After three days remove the divider from the aquarium.
Some of the fish will figure out how to get around the divider anyway, that is OK.
The aquarium divider can be cut from a plastic sheet with holes, such as an egg-crate fluorescent lighting grill.
It does not have to be a tight or perfect fit at all edges.


A natural anti-parasitic agent that seems to work well, and does not affect the biological filter is Kordon Ich Attack Disease Inhibitor; use the agent even if the fish seems healthy.
A stronger agent that must be used carefully is Kordon Rid-Ich® Disease Treatment; this will kill invertebrates.

,


Use dechlorinated new water used to maintain water level and salinity; this can be tap water if it is low in nitrates and phosphates (test it first), or reverse osmosis water if you have an RO system or wish to buy it.
Check salinity reading monthly. When using a swing-arm type meter, take several readings, since air bubbles in the meter cause false readings; other kinds of meters are floating glass or refraction based meters. Specific gravity at normal aquarium temperature should be in the 1.020 to 1.025 range.
For a fish-only aquarium, salinity does not have to be too precise but it should be stable (unchanging). Salinity will increase when the aquarium water level falls; adding top-off water raises the aquarium water level and will also return salinity to its original reading.
In hot weather, one gallon of top-off water per day might be needed; in cool weather one gallon every three days might be needed.

,


Fill a very small cup with a mixture of garlic juice, fish vitamins and then add food such as frozen cubes; after a few minutes, pour it into the aquarium.
Garlic juice for aquariums can be purchased; for example, Seachem Garlic Guard is a good choice.
Vitamin examples include Seachem Vitality, or Selcon.
Feed fish about twice per day, offering dried seaweed pieces attached to a rock with a rubber band, also provide green flake food and frozen cubes.
With a larger aquarium, as recommended, overfeeding occasionally is no problem, but in general provide only as food as the fish will eat in about two minutes.

,


These sponges are the main way that the aquarium water is kept clear and clean; clean the sponges any time they appear brown and dirty.

Use strong powerheads, such as 295 gallon per hour rating (1100 liter per hour rating) for each 25 gallons (94 liters) of aquarium size. For example, for a 75 gallon aquarium, use 3 powerheads.
Mechanical filtration from in-aquarium powerheads with sponges can be hidden behind rocks.
An example powerhead with strong flow rate that will accommodate a cylindrical sponge is the Cobalt Aquatics MJ1200 Multi-Purpose Powerhead.
Point the output of each power head into a rock so the water is not too disturbed by the flow.
Installation of this step can be delayed until the third month after initial aquarium set up.
Remove the sponges and clean them each week, then replace.
It is OK to only run the powerheads for 12 hours daily.
If you use a sump, then filter socks are convenient to replace and could be used instead of the in-aquarium powerheads with sponges.

,


It will take another two months until the bacteria that is fed from the carbon dosing to grow enough to be effective.
Carbon dosing is safest from a prepared mixture of methanol and acetic acid, as in the Red Sea NO3:PO4-X Nitrate & Phosphate Reducer product.
Run the skimmer for only about three hours after adding the carbon dosing mixture.
The skimmer can be a hang-on back type and does not need be extremely efficient.
Use the skimmer size recommended by the manufacturer for the aquarium size.

,


Example products are: Seachem Pristine, Continuum Aquatics Bacter Clean-M, or Liquid Gravel Vac

,


Use a dechlorinator and conditioner such as Seachem Prime, or Kent Marine Ammonia Detox.
After the third month from initial aquarium set up, begin adding buffer weekly. Note that this more often than is usually recommended. (if measured you would attain a dKH of about 12-14).
Buffer product examples include: Seachem Marine Buffer, Kent Marine Superbuffer dKH, or Brightwell Aquatics Alkalin8.3 Liquid pH Buffer.

,


Start this step after the third month of operation.
Examples include Microbe-lift Herbtana, or API Melafix.

,


The next month clean the other half of the aquarium gravel.
It is normal for the aquarium water to get quite cloudy; by the next morning the water should be completely clear.
Don't use sand as your substrate; it is more difficult to clean and will get sucked into pumps. Use larger sized gravel, such as crushed coral or dolomite.
It is recommended to have two sets of rocks that can be rotated: one set is in the aquarium, and the other can dry in the sun outdoors. Some green algae on the rocks is OK, but if they have a lot of brown algae:

Remove the rocks and check the nitrate levels.
Add a dose of the bacterial clean-up agent.


Alternatively, you can leave the same rocks in place permanently, but there must be a way to stir up the gravel beneath the rocks, or arrange the rocks initially so there is no gravel under them. In this case, over time, the rocks will become living rocks, more like a reef aquarium.

Clean the aquarium first.,
Read your UGF manufacturer instructions.,
Measure a length of the clear, flexible, airline tubing equal to the height of the aquarium.,
Place the baseplate on the bottom of the empty aquarium.,
Connect the hard, clear, plastic tube that will house the airstone and direct air bubbles upward to the water's surface to the base plate.,
Carefully connect the rinsed end of the flexible plastic airline tubing to the plastic valve sticking out of the airstone.,
Place the airstone in the housing tube.,
Thoroughly rinse your aquarium gravel several times to remove all dust particles.,
Finish rinsing and adding any aquarium decor you wish to place inside the tank.,
Carefully, slowly fill the aquarium with fresh, clean, dechlorinated water.,
Connect the free end of the flexible airline tubing to the air pump.,
Plug in the air pump, making sure to leave a ""drip-loop"" of hanging cord to prevent water droplets from rolling down the electrical cord and reaching the outlet.",How to Install an Undergravel Filter (UGF)," Remember to be clean yourself, but also to clean each separate part of the aquarium before installing an undergravel filter.

Thoroughly wash the undergravel filter base plate and air stone tube that will connect to the base plate.  Use fresh, clean water. Dechlorinated water is best.
Soak the airstone in clean, fresh, dechlorinated water for five minutes to ensure the airstone has been fully saturated with clean water.
Carefully rinse the airstone using clean, fresh, dechlorinated water to remove any remaining factory dust. Use caution to avoid damaging the air stone or breaking off the plastic connector valve.;
, These are important, as the steps below may differ from how you should assemble the UGF.

Remember to always read warnings, and keep warranty and original instructions in a safe place. While it easy to get caught up with the excitement of a UGF, do not be careless.

, Add 6 inches or 20 centimeters to that length.  Thoroughly rinse the measured section (tank height + 6 in/20 cm) of airline tubing with fresh, clean, dechlorinated water. Avoid using particularly hot or cold water to protect the structural integrity of the plastic tubing., Be aware of where the airstone housing tube will connect to the base plate. The vertical, hard plastic airstone housing tube is generally placed at the back of the tank so that the bubbles it produces do not obscure the observer's view of the aquarium. Try to center it as best you can. It should align easily with the walls of the aquarium if the undergravel filter was specifically designed to work in the aquarium you chose. If the undergravel filter was not designed to fit the bottom of a specific aquarium, but rather a limited range of aquarium dimensions, it may be a little more difficult to keep the base plate centered during installation.,  The connection point should be fairly obvious to identify. Ensure that the tube is securely connected so that it will not be dislodged by bubbles from the airstone, but be careful not to use too much force when connecting the tube and base plate to avoid breaking/warping the plastic., Make sure the tubing is securely attached while taking care not to break the plastic valve from the airstone., Using the airline tubing, thread the airstone down to the bottom of the hard plastic tube so that it sits near the level of the baseplate., Then gently place the gravel on top of the baseplate. A scoop or cup of sorts may be helpful in transferring the gravel into the aquarium. Be careful not to let the gravel scratch the sides of the aquarium as you place it inside. Try to keep the baseplate centered and avoid letting gravel get underneath the baseplate or inside the airstone housing tube. Cover the baseplate and any exposed aquarium bottom completely with about 2 inches or 10 centimeters of gravel., At this point, the aquarium must be place in its permanent location. A nearby outlet will be necessary for powering the air pump. Only place an aquarium on furniture specifically designed to withstand the weight of a full aquarium; water is deceptively heavy. Some aquarium hobbyists place a towel or padding on top of their aquarium furniture before placing the aquarium on top to help keep the aquarium level and absorb any droplets that may drip/splash out and roll down the outer surface of the aquarium., Try not to disturb your decor or expose the undergravel filter baseplate.  Be patient during this process., Make sure not to force the tubing onto the valve too hard to avoid splitting the soft plastic tubing., You will hear a gurgling sound as air begins to travel through the tubing into the air stone inside the aquarium. If installed correctly, a column of bubbles should form inside the plastic airstone housing within a few seconds. This indicates that the undergravel filter installation is complete."

Decorate with plastic plants.",How to Have a Low Budget Fish Tank," Glass tanks are less expensive than acrylic tanks and they don't scratch easily. To get an idea of how big your tank should be, first determine where you'd like to put your fish tank. Large tanks require more energy to heat, but take less effort to clean. On the other hand, smaller tanks need fewer decorations and fish, but they'll need to be cleaned more often.Keep in mind that you'll need to set the glass tank on a level surface that can support a lot of weight.;
, You can choose a mechanical, chemical or biological filter for your tank. Keep in mind that many filters perform a combination of these types of filtration, but you must have biological filtration to keep the tank clean. Ensure that you choose a filter that works for the size of tank you've chosen. You can choose from canister, power filters (that hang over the side of the tank), or wet/dry filters.Canister filters are usually the most cost-efficient choice. Remember that you'll need to clean the filter regularly so that it works properly., Most fish that you'll put in your freshwater aquarium will need the water temperature to be between 75 and 80 degrees F (24 and 27 C). The easiest way to maintain the temperature is to install a heater that automatically turns on and off as needed. Choose a heater that fits the size of your tank, keeping in mind that if you have a large tank, you'll need to get two smaller heaters.For a low-budget option, consider using a smaller tank so you'll only need to buy one heater. Purchase a mid-range priced heater since cheap heaters are more likely to fail., If you're growing your own plants in the fish tank, you'll have to use lighting. Otherwise, lights are optional and just useful for making the fish stand out. If you want to keep costs low, just use basic lighting for fish-only. This way, you'll only need one low-watt fluorescent light bulb which is inexpensive to run.For a fish-only aquarium, you'll only need 1 to 2 watts of light per gallon (3.78 liters) of water in the tank. You should buy the fluorescent light bulb from a pet store, since standard bulbs can make brown algae grow., A hood will cover the tank so the fish don't jump out and it will keep too much water from evaporating, so you won't need to clean it as often or add water. Too keep costs down, choose a full hood. This will include the space for your fluorescent light bulb.Full hoods are typically cheaper than glass canopy hoods which require separate lighting systems.

, Try to pick inexpensive and low-maintenance fish when you start out. Look for fish that aren't territorial since they'll be sharing the same tank. Choose fish that are easy to care for and avoid delicate fish that need water to be absolutely perfect (like neon tetras, guppies, and balloon belly mollies). Instead, consider getting:Peppered Cory catfish: Buy several of these which feed off the bottom of the tank and keep the tank clean.
Black Skirt and Serpae tetras: These tetras like to live in groups of at least five.
Betta: Although these fish are easy to care for, bettas are known for being aggressive if the tank is too crowded or there are more than one betta fish in the tank.
Sail-fin mollies: These fish are hardy and fast swimmers.

, Although fish prices vary considerably, you should have an idea of how many fish you'd like to keep in your tank. You may be able to get lots of fish very inexpensively. Or you could choose a few fish that cost a little more. Have an idea of how much you'd like to spend before you go into the pet store so you stick to a low budget.


As a general rule, you should only have one inch of fish for each gallon (3.78 liters) of water if you have a rectangular tank. You can use online calculators to determine how many fish you can put in your exact aquarium., Research what kind of food your fish will need and find which brands carry it. You'll find that there are a number of brands that carry fish food, so the cost can vary. The brand Tetra makes a good budget fish food for every type of fish.Ask about purchasing fish food in bulk, since the pet store may have deals if you buy larger quantities.

, Once you've decided what fish to get, research what they need in their tank. Avoid decorating with things or colors that irritate or stress your fish. For inexpensive decorations, check out garage sales or thrift stores. Common tank decorations include:Non-toxic figurines
Live rock
Driftwood

, For a plant-only fish tank, you can use common aquarium gravel or sand. You should fill the tank so that the gravel or sand fills about 2 1/2 inches (6.35 cm) of the tank. Sand might be the cheaper option and you can buy kids play sand (which is sterilized) or sandblasting sand.Avoid using sand from the beach since this can throw off the tank's pH balance and may still contain live organisms.

, While you can use live plants in a fish tank, these can take up more time, effort, and money to maintain. Instead, place plastic plants in the aquarium. Plastic plants can make your fish tank look more interesting and will give your fish a place to hide and play. They don't require any maintenance.Another benefit of plastic plants is that your fish won't eat them!

Leave the cloudy water.,
Add in good bacteria.,
Place suitable live plants in the tank.,
Determine if you have the correct filter.,
Stock your tank thoughtfully.",How to Keep Aquarium Water Clear1," Many times cloudy water will disappear on its own while the water environment adjusts. Often, cloudy water is a result of mixture of microscopic organisms, such as bacteria, protozoa, and micrometazoa.These organisms come from your fish, the food, and waste. Usually, the tank will balanced out and clear up within around a week.


Be patient. Before adding chemicals or trying to do anything drastic to fix the cloudy water, remember that the aquarium is full of living organisms. Figure out why the water might have become cloudy before doing anything to the water. Adding unnecessary chemicals and cleaners can upset your tank environment and harm your fish.;
, Adding in good bacteria helps the natural processes of the tank. You can get good bacteria in the tank in a couple of ways. You can buy prepackaged bacteria from the store or buy gravel that has the bacteria already on it. You can also add gravel, rocks, driftwood, or a filter pad from an established tank to your own tank. It will have the bacteria on it.Bacteria cultures will help to eliminate ammonia and nitrite, which are toxins. It changes them into less harmful nitrate, which is then removed during water changes.The best bacterial species to do so are Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter., Another way you can help keep your tank clean is by adding live plants. Live plants are covered in good bacteria, and they also are a filter for the water.You can buy these at your local pet store.

, There are different filters that do different things for your fish. Cloudy water might be due to having the wrong filter. The filter you choose depends on the density of fish, the type of aquarium you have, and the use of live plants or artificial plants.


There are three different filters to choose from. Mechanical filters remove the particles by forcing the water through a material that catches the particles. Biological filters use bacteria to change toxins into less toxic substances. Chemical filters use chemicals to remove toxins or chemical from the water.

, When you are putting fish in the tank, don’t place too many in it. This can cause health problems and make your tank harder to clean.Try to keep the amount of fish around one inch of fish per gallon of water."

Add fish.",How to Start a Saltwater Aquarium," Saltwater fish and plant life are accustomed to living in the vast space of the ocean. Therefore, a sizable tank is necessary to accommodate the type of fish that will live in a saltwater aquarium. Tanks can be found in pet stores and specific fish stores. Previously-owned saltwater aquariums are also available on the market for less than brand new tanks.


When choosing the size, consider where the tank will go, and how many fish are expected to live in it. Allow 10 gallons (37.9 L) of water per fish. For example, 10 fish can live in a 100 gallon (378.5 L) tank.





;
, In addition to the tank, the aquarium will require a lid, a stand, a filter, a heater, an interior light, a thermometer and gravel for the bottom of the tank. A hydrometer will also be necessary to measure the salt levels in the water.

, The tank will need to be located near several electrical outlets. Set up the stand and make sure it is balanced and level before placing the tank on top of it.

, Fill the tank with freshwater and make sure all of the equipment works. Leave the water for 2 days and pay attention to any malfunctioning equipment or possible leaks. The water temperature should be within 2 degrees of 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26.7 degrees Celsius). Empty the water out of the tank after 2 successful days.

, Saltwater mix will need to be added to freshwater in a bucket and added to the tank. Follow the directions for quantity on the package of saltwater mix. Mix until it is completely dissolved. Continue adding buckets of water to the tank until it is filled.

, Take a reading with the hydrometer. An ideal salt level will be from 1.020 to 1.023.

, The gravel will line the bottom of the tank and can be mixed with sand or even shells. Push any plants or other decorative pieces into the gravel so they do not float to the top.

, Make sure the aquarium works properly, maintains a proper temperature and has a good salt level before adding fish. You also want to make sure it is properly cycled.

, Put fish into the aquarium slowly. Start with 2 or 3 fish and then add more fish gradually.

Change the water.,
Keep your filter clean.,
Clean your aquarium.",How to Keep Aquarium Water Clear2," A good rule of thumb is to change 20% of the water in the tank every week. If you use tap water, let it sit for two days. This allows it to reach room temperature plus allow the chlorine in it to dissipate, which helps the water not shock the fish when it is poured into the tank.You can also buy a device that hooks to your faucet that vacuums the gravel while removing and replacing water. You don’t have to wait a few days if doing it this way. Just make sure you make sure the temperature is close to your tank’s temperature and that you add in a chlorine remover., You must keep your filter up and running. The filter helps keep your tank healthy and prosperous, so not changing it or neglecting it can lead to cloudy water or even fish death. Read the instructions for your filter to know how to take care of it.All filters need to be examined monthly and changed if needed.Check them weekly for any blockages or build up. Clean or replace as needed.
Read the instruction manual that came with your pump to make certain it is properly installed and working as it should. The pump is important in aerating the aquarium with oxygen from the air. If it is not working properly the fish will suffer especially if the water is cloudy from waste matter.

, Another way to try to clear up your water is to clean your tank regularly. You should set up a schedule to clean the tank at least once a month. This is in addition to the regularly scheduled water changing you should be doing at least once a week."

Look for bacterial blooms.,
Check your filters.,
Adjust for additional fish.,
Refrain from overfeeding your fish.,
Be mindful with decorations.,
Control algae.",How to Keep Aquarium Water Clear3," After changes to your fish tank, such as a large water change, a thorough cleaning, or medicating your fish, a bacteria bloom can occur. If this describes what led to the cloudiness in your tank, then be patient. The bacteria will balance out in a few days, and the water should clear on its own., If your filters are not working properly, then the water can become cloudy. There is bacteria in your filtration system that consumes byproducts like ammonia and keeps things clean. If the filters stop working, the bacteria can build up in the water, making it look cloudy., If you had recently added new fish to your aquarium, make sure the tank set up can handle the additional fish. For example, if you just added a larger fish to a tank that had smaller fish, it might be too much for the filtration system. Add a different filtration system, or lessen the amount of fish in your tank., Overfeeding your fish can cause cloudiness in the water. Fish need to be fed sparingly. Feed them a light amount of food once a day, and give them one or two fast days a week., Sometimes, cloudiness can be caused by decorations. Make sure to wash all decorations carefully before adding them to the tank. Check all decorations in your tank to make sure they are designed for aquariums and purchased at good pet stores.Check for melting or misshapen decorations, softening or loosening decorations, or flaking paint or discolorations on decorations.

, Green algae clings to the sides of the tanks and sometimes to the decorative items in the tank. A good time to scrape algae from the sides is when you change the water. Use a soft plastic squeegee to gently scrape the side, then rinse under water to clean before taking another swipe. Remove all the ornaments and scrub under clean, running tap water.Make sure your tank doesn’t get too much light because that can cause algae growth. Don’t place your tank close to a window and only keep lights on for 10 to 12 hours a day.It is important not to overfeed your fish as leftover food can contribute to algae growth.

Buy supplies fit for salt water.,
Set up your tank.,

Decide on which type of fish or multiple fish you want in your aquarium, then research those species.,
Look for a place that gives away fish.,
Get your fish.,
Take very, very attentive, careful and good care of your saltwater fish- this will increase its chances of a longer lifespan.,
Know that, if you take really great care of your fish and their aquarium home, you should be able to maintain a colorful saltwater aquarium.",How to Maintain Salt Water Aquariums," Get an actual fish tank, with a filter, air pump, gravel, decorations, something to do water changes with and special marine salt.;
, Install the filter and air pump, put the gravel, water, and decorations in, and put the salt in and dechlorinating the water. Do filter cleanings and water changes weekly. Make sure the tank is big enough for the fish before getting either, and monitor the amount of salt in the aquarium.

, This will get the tank ready for the fish and give you good practice. If you're a bit extra paranoid you could also set up a pretend aquarium for more practice before you set up the real fishtank. (A good way to do this is to fill a plastic drawer with water, put two toy fish in it, use ripped up napkin in an empty water bottle for fish food, use a dirty cup for the filter, use a box for the air pump and water with soap in it for the dechlorinating materials...)

, Make sure they are saltwater fish, not brackish-water fish! For example, while clownfish and yellow tangs are saltwater fish, but Black Mollies and Dalmatian Lyretail Mollies are brackish-water fish with very different water needs!

, A pet store could be a place to start but isn't always the best place to get any animal. Rescue groups are rare for fish but they do exist.  If you do decide to get a fish from the pet store, make sure it and the other fish in the tank are healthy. If any fish have white spots, irregular swimming patterns, or anything of the like, it is a sign of illness. Don't get the fish there if the tank water is dirty or something either, as it can cause major sickness in fish.

, Bring them home in the bag- careful not to pop it!- and then hold the bag in the tank water for a while so the fish gets used to the new water temperature.  Put some tank water in the bag. Then slowly let the fish swim into the tank. Your fish is home!

, Work on being extremely observant, since illness can be very hard to spot in many animals. You might even want to install a second filter for extra cleanliness of the tank, though this will mean more filter cleaning every week.

, However, all fish die. If your fish does die, by all means do not flush it down the toilet. Drains, unlike in the movie Finding Nemo, do not lead to the ocean: they lead to the sewage system. It isn't as much of a ""burial at sea"" as it is a ""burial in the sewers"".


Instead, take your fish outside- preferably in some sort of container filled with water- and bury it deep in the ground. If you have any pets that might try to dig up the fish, keep them away from it, and make a marker for where the fish is buried so you remember they can't go over there.

Avoid overfeeding.,
Use a chemical to kill the snails.,
Place snail traps in the tank.,
Add snail predators to your tank.,
Try multiple solutions.,
Clean everything.",How to Get Rid of Snails in an Aquarium1," Overfeeding can led to a snail population boom. Try underfeeding your aquarium inhabitants (only feeding enough for the fish to eat at each feeding) to see if that solves snail overpopulation.;
, The most common, fish-safe chemical used to kill snails is copper sulfate. If this is used, you need to carefully follow the directions for use given on the bottle to make sure your fish survive the treatment. Most times this will cause a massive snail die-off which may foul your aquarium. If so you will need to spend time removing dead snails and adjusting the water to make sure it remains healthy for your fish and any live plants.

, Various snail traps are available on-line or through pet stores to trap snails. However, a very simple trap is to place a large piece of lettuce in the aquarium, clip the sturdy stem end to the aquarium’s side, and leave it overnight.In the morning, remove the leaf and you will most likely find a large number of snails on the underside. Doing this a few nights in a row may help rid your aquarium of vast numbers of snails.


Snails can also be picked out of the aquarium as they are seen. This is most effective when there are smaller number of snails. However, since snails are mainly nocturnal it may not make a dent in the problem.

, Scavenger fish are good fish to add to the tank to eat snails. For smaller tanks, try Zebra or Dwarf Chain loaches. For larger tanks, Clown Loaches or Pictus Catfish will do the job.Assassin snails will also eat their snail brethren. They don’t reproduce as readily, so generally don’t become a problem like other snails.

, Clearly there are various methods to rid your aquarium of these problem pests. Since snails can quickly overwhelm your tank with their sheer numbers, this should be a priority task. You may need to try a couple in order to get rid of the snails inhabiting your tank.

, If the situation is totally out of hand or you want a 100% resolution you can do a deep clean of the tank. This means each item in the tank from gravel, to décor, to plants are removed, water is drained and every item cleaned and dried before refilling and restocking the tank.

"
"
Inspect all items entering the tank.,
Quarantine items before placing them in the tank.,
Dip all aquarium additions in a snail killing solution before adding them to the tank.",How to Get Rid of Snails in an Aquarium2," Preventing the introduction of snails into the aquarium can save you a lot of time and trouble. Inspect live plants or décor for snails or their eggs before placing in your tank. Remove any snails or eggs before placing into your aquarium.

, Quarantine live plants before placing into your tank by having a quarantine tank. Leave the plants in there a few weeks and pick off any snails you find.

, Dipping plants in a bleach solution can kill snails and eggs. Make a solution of 1 part plain bleach to 19 parts of water, which is about 3/4 cup bleach to a gallon of water. Dip the plants in this solution for two to three minutes, remove and rinse well under running water for up to five minutes.This can be a bit harsh on certain plants so there is no guarantee that it won’t harm the plant.
You can also place plants in a killing solution of aluminum sulfate and water.Add 2-3 teaspoons of aluminum sulfate to a gallon of warm water and stir to dissolve. Submerge the plants in this and let the them sit in this for at least 2-3 hours but up to 24 hours. When you remove the plants, rinse them well before adding to your aquarium.

Riding a donkey is it's own unique experience that's especially pleasurable when you don't have the same expectations you would for a horse.


Donkeys are less responsive to training, so they don't have fancy gaits. A slow, plodding walk is the most comfortable gait for a donkey.
Donkeys are extremely reliable and gentle, and aren't as finicky as horses. Donkeys are great for kids to ride.
Dressage training is increasingly popular among donkey riders. Donkey dressage is similar to horse dressage but it showcases donkeys' unique traits and abilities.;
, Donkeys are hard workers with big energy reserves. Because they were originally desert animals, they're adept at moving through tough terrain without very many breaks. They like plenty of exercise and are usually game for a long trail ride or a simple walk around the property.


Donkeys are wonderful to ride on long trails, where the pace is slow and steady. Because of their great endurance, they have often been used as pack animals and used to traverse tough hiking trails.
Donkeys can help in work situations, especially with herding goats and sheep. They are excellent herders. For this reason, it's a good idea to always keep a fence between donkeys and other farm animals unless they're actively herding.

, The experience of riding a donkey is pleasant, but not necessarily exciting. Unlike horses, they won’t be interested in jumping logs or galloping across fields. If you try to encourage them to do so, they usually just stand still and won't budge, which is probably why they have a reputation for being stubborn.


Donkeys have a shorter stride than horses and tend to move slowly. They aren't physically capable of performing feats of agility the way horses can.
Donkeys like familiarity and get their reputation for stubbornness because they don’t react well to unfamiliar situations. They like to have time to consider a given situation, and hurrying them along doesn't do much good.

, Donkeys should be trained by someone familiar with their temperaments and abilities. Training a donkey is similar to training a horse, but since donkeys have different abilities, they need a trainer who knows what he or she is doing. Donkeys should first learn to be led on a halter, then how to carry a saddle and take riding commands., Donkeys are commonly too small to be ridden. It’s very important not to ride a donkey that’s too small to carry your weight, since that could injure the donkey. A good rule of thumb to follow is that a donkey can safely carry 20 percent of its body weight.Miniature donkeys are not suitable to be ridden, unless you want to have your toddler ride one under supervision.
Mid-sized donkeys are fine for children, but as the children grow up they will need to find a larger donkey.
Mammoth donkeys are large enough to carry adults.

, Like horses, donkeys’ temperaments differ according to their sex. Finding a donkey with a good riding temperament will have a big impact on the riding experience. Here are the three types of donkeys and their temperaments:


Geldings are male donkeys that have been castrated. They tend to have a mild temperament well-suited to being ridden.
Jennys are female donkeys. They usually have a gentle, domesticated temperament as well.
Jacks are uncastrated males. They are typically too wild to ride.

, Many donkeys make great pets, but not all are cut out for being ridden. Find out whether the donkey was trained to carry a saddle and follow riding commands. Get a donkey that has been trained to be ridden, not just walked on a lead., Donkeys have a reputation for being stubborn, but really they just need time to assess each situation and decide how to respond. They’re deep thinkers. This can be frustrating when you’re on a donkey’s back and would like it to move forward. If you're planning to purchase a donkey spend time walking and riding the donkey to make sure it's a good fit.


Patience is a virtue when it comes to riding donkeys. Try to gain an understanding of the donkey's personality so you can work as a team and have a much more pleasant ride together.
If you’re not the patient type, you’ll need a donkey that’s exceptionally responsive. You may instead want to consider choosing a small horse or pony.

, Donkeys’ bodies are structured differently from horses’ bodies. Get a saddle and other equipment made for donkeys or burros, rather than one for horses.Donkeys can carry a lot of weight, but their backs are wider than horses' backs, so the saddle construction is different. A saddle that doesn't fit correctly can lead to health problems for the donkey.


Bits and other tack should also be fitted to your donkey's needs.
Blinders are commonly used to keep donkeys focused on the path ahead, but some donkey trainers recommend against using them. If you want to use heavy saddle bags, have the donkey practice with them at home before setting off on a long trail ride.

, If you've never had riding lessons, it's a good idea to take some so you can learn the proper way to command a donkey for a smoother ride. The most important thing to remember is that you shouldn't try to make a donkey to do something it doesn't want to do. You must gently coax the donkey to keep moving instead of using force.


Verbal commands and nonverbal commands like hand signals and touching the donkey are ways to let it know what you want it to do.Whipping and harsh kicking are ineffective, and will serve only to erode the trust you have with your donkey. Treat your donkey gently and patiently as you ride.

, Make sure your donkey is healthy so he doesn’t get injured when you go for a ride. Donkey's need dry, warm shelter, proper feed and plenty of water, and attention to their hooves and teeth. Make sure you attend to the donkey's health before taking it out for a long ride.Donkeys' hooves must be kept dry, or they will begin to rot. Donkeys need to overnight in a dry shelter. If you're doing an overnight trail ride, make sure there's a dry shelter where the donkey can stay overnight.
When it comes to food, donkeys need plenty of grass, and not much else. They are prone to getting overweight easily, so make sure the donkey is getting plenty of exercise.

Pick a donkey of the right size, sex and temperament.,
Make sure the donkey has basic training.,
Keep more than one donkey if you can.,
Be gentle with your donkey.,
Let your donkey exercise every day.",How to Care for a Donkey1," When you're picking out a donkey, it's important to take these factors into consideration. Male and female donkeys have different temperaments, and there are miniature, standard and giant-sized donkeys which are as big as standard horses. Figure out which type is the right fit for your needs before you decide which one to bring home.


If you plan to keep your donkey as a pet, choose a gelding (a castrated male) or a jenny (a female).
If you plan to breed your donkey, you'll need a jack (an intact male) and one or more jennies. Don't get a jack if you just want a pet, and don't keep a jack with other male donkeys, since they'll fight.
If you plan to ride your donkey, make sure its big enough to handle your weight. A donkey can safely carry 20% of its body weight. Also, just like mule, horse or camel, make sure they are not sick or injured, because this could make it worse
If you plan to use your donkey as a guard animal against predators, such as wolves or dogs, choose a standard or giant donkey, not a miniature. It's important that the donkey be larger than the predator.;
, If this is your first time handling a donkey, you'll want to choose one who already knows how to stand and walk on a lead without bolting. You may also want to make sure the donkey can handle being petted all over its body and will allow you to lift its feet without trouble. Donkeys can be a little tricky to train, so unless you're experienced with them, it's a good idea to choose one that is fairly well behaved or find a friend to help you.

, Donkeys are extremely social creatures, and they get sad when they're left all alone in the pasture. Your donkey will be a lot happier with a companion. Two jennies, two geldings, or a jenny and a gelding make good companions for each other. Donkeys will bond deeply with their companions for life, and they won't want to go anywhere without each other.


Donkeys can bond with horses, but if you ever plan to take the horse somewhere without the donkey, it's not advisable to allow them to create a deep bond. The donkey will become upset when you remove the horse from the pasture. It's better to keep them in separate enclosures.
Donkey have very specific dietary needs, and if kept with other species are likely to become overweight and unwell.
Donkeys and dogs don't make good companion animals, unless they're raised together from the time they are babies.

, Donkeys should not be harshly punished. Practice gentleness and patience when you're trying to lead them or teach them something new. They aren't stubborn, but they need time to process situations before deciding what to do, and they dislike being hurried or forced to act. Pet your donkey, speak in soothing tones, and don't raise your voice or be forceful.

, In order to stay fit and healthy, they need daily exercise. They'll exercise themselves if they have a large enough pasture to roam around. You can also take your donkey for a walk using a long rope lead. Remember that it's not a good idea to ride your donkey unless it's large enough to support your weight.


Let your donkey get extra exercise in winter. If you have to shut your donkey up during winter, you will need to let it out every few days for exercise. If you can allow the donkey to wander around the barn in between outdoor outings, this would be ideal. Don’t force a donkey that hates snow to go out into the elements; provide this animal with an alternative indoor exercise area. Keep a coat on the donkey if you’d like during winter outings to prevent chills; donkeys can get pneumonia or bronchitis if subjected to rain or very cold weather.

Research the fish you would like to own.,
Buy a tank that is going to fit all the fish!,
Get substrate that your fish would expect i.e.,
Chose a filter system that will be right for you.,
Buy plants and wood to make hiding places for your fish.,
You'll need a thermometer and heater!,
Get a hood!,
Buy all the chemicals you need to start up and maintain a tank, such as dechlorinator to make tap water safe for fish.

,
Make sure your tank is on a sturdy stand, 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water weight about ten pounds plus all the rocks!,
Add all of your chemicals to the tank, plug in the filters and let the tank run!,
Test the water!,
Get your fish!,
Once you bring the fish home (only after the water has safe levels of chemicals) ""float"" them in the bag they are in on top of the water for about half an hour.,
Turn off any tank lights to make the transition less stressful for the fish.,
Doing weekly or biweekly 25% water changes will keep your fish happy and healthy.,
Enjoy!

","How to Have a Healthy, Happy Aquarium"," You want to know things like, their adult size, what their natural environment is, what other fish they are compatible with, and what kinds of things they eat, what temperature range they live in, and the pH range they will tolerate.;
, Not the size they are now, but the fish's adult size! Your fish should have no problem turning around in the tank once they reach their adult size. Each fish should have several gallons of water for just them.

, sand for salt water fish, pebbles for river fish. You should have 1 pound of substrate for each gallon of water

, There are many out there, each requiring different amounts of care and maintenance.

, Many fish will be more comfortable and less shy if they have dark places they can go to hide if they feel nervous or are just trying to get out of their light.

, Make sure you get one that will be able to heat the amount of water in your tank

, Lots of fish can be good jumpers and need to have the tank covered so they can't exit the tank.

,, When adding the water, it works well if you put a large plate one the bottom of the tank so the water doesn't move all the substrate.

, Its advisable to let it run for at least a month before adding fish, adding fish food to feed the beneficial bacteria that should start to grow in the filter. There needs to be a high level of beneficial bacteria to get rid of the waste produced by the fish when you add them, otherwise the fish will die slowly and painfully in the toxic water.

, either buy a 35 dollar test kit or take in a water sample to a fish store. You should check for pH, ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates! The pH should what the fish you intend to keep would have in the wild, ammonia and nitrite should never be above 0 or the fish will get sick. Nitrates help plants to grow but too much causes algae, it shouldn't be above 40ppm.

, Not all at once though. Too many fish at once will mean that the filter bacteria cannot cope with all the waste. No more than 1 large or 5 small fish should be put into the tank within a week period.

, Do this so they can adjust to the temperature. The add a small amount of tank water to the bag every 10 minutes or so for about an hour, or more if they are sensitive fish. This helps the fish prepare for the unique water conditions in your tank.

, Do not feed your new fish until a day has passed from purchase. Stressed fish will most likely not eat or it will produce a lot of waste. Let it settle and get used to its environment before trying to give it food.

, Invest a gravel siphon(vacuum) and dechlorinator, this should be added every time tap water is put into the tank, as chlorine is very painful for fish.

Donkeys' main food sources should be low sugar and high fibre.,
Donkeys need to eat little and often (like other equines) and don't do well if fed large amounts of food in one go ie.,
Donkeys are happiest with plenty of space to roam around and graze, which they do for the majority of the day.,
A great alternative to lush pasture is having a dirt paddock, or a non-grazing area, such as a concrete yard, or a sand school.,
Give appropriate treats.,
Donkeys are vegetarian and should never be fed anything derived from meat or fish.

,
Check with your vet about dietary supplements; these may be recommended depending on the soil type of your particular region.,
Provide clean, fresh water.,
Set up a dry shelter with hard floors.,
If you chose to put a rug on your donkey for the winter (seriously cold weather, or an elderly/thin donkey) then make sure you take the rug off, check for rubs and replace every day.

,
Keep the feeding area clean.,
Surround the area with a sturdy fence.",How to Care for a Donkey2," Barley straw (the stalk of the plant after the grain has been harvested) is a great option for this and means they can happily munch for hours on end without gaining weight.

, a morning and evening 'bucket feed'. You should avoid feeding your donkey any cereals or grains such as oats, barley, wheat and corn (maize). These products are too high in starch and sugar and have been implicated in the development of diseases such as laminitis in donkeys, as well as a leading cause of obesity.

, Its hard to say specifically how much grass a pair of donkeys needs, as grazing can vary so much. Grass should be considered an additional to straw, rather than making up the majority of their diets.

, Donkeys always need to have something to nibble on so make sure you keep an adequate supply of straw available at all times.


During the winter, when the grass is dead, or at other times of year when there's not enough grass, you can supplement your donkey's diet with meadow hay. This needs to be good quality in terms of being clean, well produced and mould-free, late-cut hay may be better as it is higher in fibre and lower in sugar. Avoid alfalfa unless you have a pregnant or nursing mare, or other special need animals. Make sure it's not old or spoiled, or your donkey could become sick. If you can afford chaff with additives that target hooves, coats, and so on, you may want to investigate the options available. Chaff tends to be suitable for older donkeys with teeth troubles, convalescing donkeys and nursing donkeys.
Be careful not to overfeed your donkey. Donkeys become ill with life-threatening diseases when they eat too much protein and other nutrient-rich food. Donkeys evolved in the arid and semi-arid areas of the Middle East and North Africa, and as a result can get all the nutrients they need from high fibre, scrubby pasture. When grass is too rich or abundant (think dairy or horse pasture), you might have to limit the area available to them to prevent them from eating too much and gaining too much weight. Rigging up a safe, movable electric fence will allow you to portion off the field and restrict the amount they can eat. Move the fence regularly to give them a little bit of fresh grazing.

, As stated above, donkeys put on weight easily, so be careful with the treats. Give no more than a handful of any treat at a time. Apples, carrots and bananas (skins on) are ideal. Scraps from your kitchen are not a good idea as donkeys will have trouble digesting anything from the brassica family (broccoli, cauliflower etc), potatoes, onions and many more. Fresh or dried mint leaves make a great treat. Donkeys need a simple, healthy diet and this doesn't include things like toast, biscuits or cakes. Steer clear of highly processed, sugary human and equine snacks for donkeys.

,, Here are a few supplements your vet may recommend:


An equine specific salt/mineral licking-block may be helpful, but check with your vet first. Chose one that doesn't contain molasses, otherwise they will just be licking the block for the sweet sugar taste.
High fibre cubes—may be fed to donkeys needing to gain a little weight, try to find one targeted specifically for donkeys (you may be out of luck here depending where you live), or a second best would be one for good-doers and ponies.






Freeze-dried grass—may be a useful supplement for some ill, underweight donkeys to get them back on form, make sure it is pesticide-free, and never feed a donkey grass clippings as the type of grass may be harmful to the donkey. Be cautious feeding freeze dried grass in any quantity as the high sugar levels could be dangerous to a healthy animal and trigger the painful hoof disease called laminitis.
Protein pellets/cubes—these pre-made pellets contain essential nutrients; they're useful for nursing mothers with foals or for donkeys living through very cold winters that might need a boost. Otherwise, this feed is too rich for everyday purposes. Never substitute with pellets meant for a different animal (e.g. poultry pellets); some pellets contain meat and this is poisonous to donkeys.
Carrots—what ungulate (hoofed animal) doesn’t love a carrot?

, Set up a water trough or bucket and keep it full of fresh, unfrozen water at all times. Make sure it doesn't leak onto the floor of the donkey's shelter, since they need a completely dry floor for their hooves. Don’t forget to check in winter to see whether it has frozen over; if it has, you’ll need to clear the ice away, or equip the tank with a heater. Older donkeys will really appreciate a drink of warm water in the winter.

, Donkeys originated in a desert climate. They prefer warmer weather but are very hardy, provided they are given adequate accommodation. Donkeys do not like wind or rain and will seek shelter from both. Unlike horses, rain seeps into a donkey’s coat and makes life unbearable. The shelter doesn’t need to be elaborate, as long as it is adequate and provides the protection a donkey seeks. A shed, lean-to or barn with hard wooden floors is ideal. Make sure the floors are hard and dry. Donkeys have porous hooves that can become diseased when they stand in wet areas for too long.


In a temperate climate, provide a shelter which consists of a minimum of three walls, with adequate backspace to get out of the rain and wind. This might be a shed, a stable or even a small barn. Put straw on the ground for comfort and warmth, especially in the cooler months of the year.
In a climate with severe winter (temperatures below freezing and featuring ice, snow and freezing gales), you must provide a donkey with barn accommodation. The barn should be snug; plug up any gaps that let draughts through to prevent the donkey from catching chills. A winter barn should also have adequate space for exercise, in case the donkey does not like being taken outside at all while snow rests on the ground.

,, To avoid possible contamination or worm problems, always keep a donkey’s feed area clean. Remove mud, wash food buckets daily and keep hay in a string basket attached to a wall (a hay-net), off the floor. Keep the shelter clean by mucking it out at least every other day to remove the donkey's waste and hay. Spray down the floor and walls and allow them to completely dry out before the donkey uses the shelter again.

, To keep your donkey in and to protect your donkey from predators such as dogs and wolves, or from misguided attempts to push through the fence, build solid, secure fencing around the area you have set aside for your donkey. Donkeys are quite clever, and they'll find a way to escape if you don't install a good fence around the pasture and shelter area. It should be at least as high as the donkey's shoulders.

"
Brush the donkey regularly.,
Keep the hooves dry and trimmed.,
Check the teeth for sharp edges.,
Keep vaccinations up–to-date.,
Donkeys, like horses can get intestinal worms.,
Keeping the pasture and barn as free from waste as possible will help to break the life cycle of the worm as they need to live for a certain amount of time outside the donkey before being ingested.",How to Care for a Donkey3," The best way to clean donkeys is to brush them every day. They don't like to get wet, so it's not necessary to spray them down or give them baths. A daily brushing, as well as cleaning the muck from their hooves, will suffice., Donkeys' hooves grow, just like people's nails, and they need to be trimmed from time to time so they don't get too long and crack. Have a professional farrier trim the donkey's hooves to the appropriate angle, which is 60 to 65 degrees.The donkey's hooves should be trimmed every 8 weeks or so.

, Donkeys' teeth also grow continuously, and they get worn down when the donkey chews food. Your donkey should be seen by an equine dentist every year regardless of how the teeth appear to you. Your donkeys teeth go back as far as the length of your forearm, so there is no way to know what is going on at the back of the mouth without specialist tools. The dentist will need to check right to the back of the mouth to make sure your donkey has functioning teeth that aren't causing difficulty eating and constant pain.


A donkey with poor teeth may be happier on a diet of chaff or mash/wet feed – this will obviate the need for the donkey to chew too much on grass or hay. Consult with your vet as to the best options.

, Donkeys are hardy and almost disease-free. They do need to be vaccinated yearly against tetanus, flu and distemper. Other vaccinations to consider, depending on where you reside, include rabies, encephalitis, and West Nile Virus.

, Both horses and donkeys are beginning to suffer due to overzealous use of wormers in the past, as now the worms aren't responding as they used to and the drugs are becoming more and more inefficient. There is no easy answer to this, but the way forward is definitely not continuing on with the same pattern of untargeted worming that has caused the situation to arise. Donkeys and horses should be have their feces tested four times a year to see what (if any) worms they have and then appropriate treatment can be given. Ask your vet to give you guidance on this, and also ask for a follow up check to make sure the treatment worked.

, Minimizing the number of larva that are eaten is a practical way to help combat the number of intestinal worms in your donkey. 'Poo picking' the grazing at least 3 times a week has been found to significantly reduce the number of worms on the pasture.

Check your equine's teeth to try to see what condition they're in.,

Know some of the possible teeth trouble signs in an equine.,
Weight loss or difficulty in maintaining weight.",How to Check Whether Your Horse or Donkey Needs to See a Dentist,"


Equines have baby teeth and between the ages of two and a half to four and half years, horses will cut 24 teeth. An equine dentist should be asked to check that all of the teeth have been shed correctly and to check that the new ones are in good condition.
Older equines need equine dental care too. For a horse, teeth reach their life's end at around the age of 20.This results in slow eating and poor grinding of food, which can cause colic or weight loss. An equine dentist or Veterinarian can help improve the situation for a bit longer.;
, Stand or bend so that you're at eye level with your horse. Gently pull the lips apart and check the teeth. For a horse, expect to see six incisors on the top row and six incisors on the bottom row. All of these teeth should meet accurately in a horizontal line. If there are any teeth missing, extra teeth, or the teeth are uneven, get help from an equine dentist or Veterinarian.

, Gaps in the teeth indicate that your horse (or other equine) has a problem with his incisors. Check these teeth by gently pushing the horse's cheeks upward and inward using the palms of your hands. If your horse reacts by flinching, pulling back, or throwing up his head, it's demonstrating discomfort.

, The following signs should be checked out by an equine dentist or Veterinarian:



Head: A horse that throws or tilts its head for no known reason may have teeth problems. If you've already discounted bridle, behavioral, etc., problems, check for teeth issues. Your horse may shake his head or bang it against objects.

Expression: If your horse looks bothered or has a sudden attitude change (from being placid to badly behaved), poor teeth may be an issue.

Riding: When riding, you may notice either the head problem described earlier, or a tendency to not stop, turn, or perform any other requested tasks. Your horse might open his mouth while he is being ridden.

Equipment: Poor teeth can be the cause of not wanting to accept a bridle or bit. Chomping or leaning on the bit can indicate teeth issues.

Touching your equine: Your horse or donkey may not like being touched around the cheek area, or head.

Feeding: Recurring colic can be a sign of poor teeth because the teeth are not breaking down the food properly. The cheeks may be packed with feed that is not getting broken down. Food may be dropped while being eaten and feces may have unusually large lumps in it. This is called ""quidding"".

, Even though your horse may be on a proper diet, or even a diet designed to help with weight gain, if the horse's teeth are not in good condition, he can't chew the food properly to receive the needed nutrients.



Internal indicators: Other signs of teeth problems can include bad breath, bleeding from the mouth, eye or nose discharge, drooling saliva, etc. These can hint at possibility of just needing the horse's teeth floated, or something more serious like an impacted tooth.

Take good care of the donkey.",How to Buy Donkeys," Like any big farm animal, they need a lot of space and the right kind of environment, supplies, and food. Do your research to decide if you can commit to providing a good home for the donkey.;
, Big animals like donkeys require a lot of expert care, and the costs of supplies, food, and any vet bills can really add up. If you're an experienced farmer or donkey owner already, consider all the costs thoroughly before you commit to the purchase.

, You must have everything you need to care for a donkey before getting one. Buy the following supplies:


Food and water buckets
Food
Good fencing
Strong shelter

, Every farm animal needs sturdy fencing to protect it and to keep it from leaving the safe area you've chosen to house it in. Stronger fencing is a good idea if you have multiple donkeys, or are trying to keep them separate from other animals or predators.


A wide open space is also recommended because donkeys are big animals and need lots of space to run and exercise.
Make sure your donkey has a good shelter too. Multiple donkeys will need bigger shelter and places to eat. Stalls are good shelters too.

, In picking your donkey, make sure you consider size, sex and temperament. Male and female donkeys have different temperaments, and you'll also need to pick between miniature, standard and mammoth-sized donkeys. Figure out which type is the right fit for your needs before you pick which one to bring home.

, Provide lots of exercise opportunities, appropriate food, and good veterinary care when needed. If you take good care of your donkey, it might live to be over 30 years old."

They are not tagged in anything by anyone.
There are only pictures of themselves, no repeated shots with friends or family.

, Use whatever information this person has provided you with to see if you can piece together the real person. Use images, phone numbers, identifying information, to see what comes back.


Be aware that not much will come back for very private persons. This is always something you have to balance when smoking out a catfish––either the person is lying or they're extremely private.

, Provide proof if they want it but you don't need to go overboard. After all, they're the one doing the lying.

, If they do not comply, maybe it is best because you are better off with out them. You do not need closure on something that is fake.

, This is only healthy.

, One rotten apple shouldn't spoil the whole bunch. Put it behind you and don't let it ruin things for you.

, Look through the profiles of other people, with a bit more wisdom this time about what to watch out for. Find some new people to connect with and take it from there.

, Distract yourself for a while before trying to find online friends or dates again. Spend time with real life friends, do hobbies, go to the movies or treat yourself to dinner.

Consider getting a new fish.",How to Get over a Fish's Death," There is nothing strange or wrong with mourning the passing of a living being that was important to you, indeed it is a natural reaction. Don’t feel the need to hurry up and get over the death of your fish. People need different amounts of time to grieve - there is no set amount of time for when grieving should end. Take the time that you need to work through this.;
, Grieving is a process. Although some people may not understand, you may go through some or all of the five stages of grief due to the loss of your fish. The stages include denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.


You may not want to believe that your fish is dead. For a few days, you could be in denial, not wanting to accept that your fish is really gone.
Feeling angry at yourself for what you think you could or should have done to save your fish is also a normal stage of grieving. Don’t be too hard on yourself, however.
Many people feel depressed after the loss of a pet. It is okay to cry or feel sad for a while immediately following the death.

, These may be family members, friends, or even an online forum. Share what you are feeling with them. These are people that care about you, and empathize with what you are going through. They can help you work through what you are feeling.

, This event will not only give you the opportunity to remember your fish and say goodbye, but can also be the time that you take care of the remains. This can be a few last words before a trash receptacle service, or a full-blown funeral with burial, it is your choice. Have a few moments of silence to reflect on your relationship with your fish.
You may want to say a few words, play a song, or read a poem that reminds you of your fish.
Some people light a small candle in honor of their fish.

, Although it might be too painful for you to look through now, later you will be glad you preserved the memories. If you have things that remind you of your fish, put them away so that later you can reflect on your pet.


Create a scrapbook. You might include a brochure from the pet store about the fish, drawings, photos, the leaves of the fake or live plants from the tank, etc.Write a poem, short story or biography about your fish.
Make a slideshow or frame a photo of your fish.

, You can use your tank to honor the memory of your fish in a variety of creative ways.


If you are still using the tank for other fish, you may want to put something in there in memory of the fish you lost. It could be a tiny hand-made tombstone, or a pretty rock or seashell with a coloring and pattern that reminds you of your fish.
If you don’t have other fish, you can clean the aquarium out and use it to hold a memorial plant or flowers.
If the tank is empty, and looking at it causes you too much pain, then clean it out and put it away. Put a nice plant or decoration in the place where the fish tank used to be.
You can also decide to keep you're fish in safe place like a box, it can be homemade, or have your little one cremated.

, Sometimes fish can appear dead, but are actually sick or in distress. Before you dispose of the body, make sure that your fish is actually dead.Sometimes fish can swim on their side or upside down because they are constipated.Check the gills, eyes, and skin carefully.


Watch the gill covers closely. For a few moments, watch your fish to make sure it’s not just breathing very slowly.
Does it respond when you gently nudge it? If the skin has become discolored or white, it may indicate rotting, parasites, or disease.
Look at your fish’s eyes. If the eyes have turned grey, then the fish has passed on.

, If possible, look the fish over and try to figure out why it died.Especially if you have other fish in that tank or plan on getting another fish in the future, this can help you prevent future deaths. It can also give you a sense of closure, so that you aren’t continually wondering why your fish died.


Check the water levels. Was the tank overfull? Did the fish jump out because the water level was too high or because there wasn’t a lid on the tank? Was there enough water in the tank?
Test the water quality. Are the pH, ammonia, nitrite, etc. levels what they should be?
Is there obvious injury (split fins, open wounds, etc.)? Does it appear the fish got into a fight or injured by some of the tank equipment?
Do you see any signs of disease, infection, or parasites? Is the body discolored or bloated? Is it possible your fish ate too much or became poisoned by something foreign in the tank? , Once you are sure your fish is dead, then you need to take care of the remains. There are several options you have for taking care of the body, and the final decision is up to you. While many people flush their fish down the toilet, this is not recommended. If the fish died of a disease, it could pollute the local water.


Don't put your dead fish in a body of water, such as a pond, river, or the ocean. Your fish could be carrying a disease which can infect wildlife. You can bury it in the backyard, a composting area, or a flower pot. Make sure you bury the body at least two feet deep (60 cm) so that other animals don’t dig the body up.
Some people believe that the body doesn’t contain the “spirit” of the fish anymore and simply place their fish’s body in the trash. , Is there anything you can do to prevent your other fish from dying? If your fish died from a disease or parasite, keep a close eye on any remaining fish in case they get sick, too.


Change the water immediately after you remove your dead fish. This will help remove harmful viruses, bacteria, etc. that may be in the water.
If you don't have one already, invest in a filter and, for tropical fish (including bettas), a heater.
Make sure that your tank is large enough for the fish you keep or plan on keeping.

, This can be a smart move if a fish falls ill in the future. Putting it in the quarantine tank can give you time to closely observe it and try to determine what is wrong. It also helps protect any other fish you may have.

, You may want to get a new fish (or two), not necessarily to replace the fish that died, but to continue the type of relationship you had with that fish. You can even get a new fish that resembles the one you have lost.


If you're thinking about getting a new fish, remember that you will have to cycle the tank again before adding your new fish.
If the water and everything else seem okay, add more fish to the aquarium after about a week. This will give you time to monitor the other fish, the water, etc. to make sure everything is as it should be.
Only add a few new fish at a time. This will make it easier for you to watch all the fish to see how they are getting along and to make sure that they are all healthy.

, Happy fish will be more alert, active, and colorful, and will live longer. Use How to take care of your fish as a guide. In particular, research the specific needs of the fish in your tank. Always use a filter to keep things clean, and make sure your fish have enough room.

, Proper nutrition is part of good care, and will have a marked effect on the color and behavior of your fish. Try to feed breed-specific food (betta pellets for bettas, tropical flakes for tropicals, etc.) mixed with nutritious treats such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, algae wafers and even fresh veggies.

, Feed small portions twice a day, and your fish may come to associate you with food, darting out to greet you when you walk by.

, A well designed aquarium will not only be pleasant to look at, but decorations and plants will give your fish an interactive habitat.

,


A single betta or goldfish can be beautiful to watch, and these intelligent fish often form bonds with their caretakers. These and other solitary fish like bettas, goldfish, and oscars can often be taught simple tricks, and many will perform entertaining antics without any encouragement.
A large tank with many community fish is always busy. Small schooling fish, such as danios and tetras, will interact with one another, often chasing each other about. You can mix large groups for dazzling color combinations, or create one large school. When carefully planned, many different kinds of fish can be peacefully kept together, and their individual personalities will delight you.
Guppies are prolific breeders, and come in every color and pattern you can imagine. They do great in a tank of their own, and get along with most community fish too.

, While not strictly fish, small shrimp and apple snails are fascinating to watch. Ghost shrimp have transparent bodies, and when they eat you can see their organs working. These invertebrates will also help keep everything clean, eating algae off the walls, and the leftover food from the tank floor, and should get along with most fish (provided they don't become dinner!).

, Never startle your fish or tap on the glass. This will only teach them to hide when you walk by. Try to avoid frequent, large water changes as these can send your fish into shock. Instead, maintain your water chemistry with weekly small (10-25%) water changes.

, Find a comfortable spot nearby and watch your fish. Settle in and let the gentle movement relax you. Fish tanks are great stress relievers, and beautiful living works of art. With time, you will get to know each fish individually, and may even be able to spot illness in time to treat it.

, If you're patient and your fish is willing, it may be possible to train your fish to do basic tricks.


Get a flake of fish food and put it next to your fish tank.
Put your finger in the water.
Put your wet finger on the flake of food; it should stick there. Make sure your finger is not too wet, just damp.
Hover your finger just over the water and wait. Your pet fish should jump up and get its food. (Chinese fighting fish are usually happy to do this.)

If your fish does not jump, it may not be big enough.

Look for a nuchal hump on male fish.,
Spot a larger anal fin on certain male fish.,
Identify a male fish if it has large dorsal or anal fins.,
Watch for seasonal bumps on male fish.,
Note that larger fish may be female.,
Watch for flashy growth on males during breeding season.,
Look for aggressive behavior to identify a male fish.",How to Determine the Sex of a Fish1," A nuchal hump is a small bump on the forehead of a fish. The presence of one can be taken as confirmation that a fish is male. As a result, look carefully to see if a specific fish has or doesn’t have a nuchal hump.


Many species of fish won’t have a nuchal hump, and if they do, it might not be apparent.
Nuchal humps as an indicator a fish is a male are very pronounced on cichlid fish like tilapia, angelfish, oscars, and discus.;
, Fish in the family Poeciliidae have a modified anal fin that is used for sexual reproduction. This fin looks like a triangle. The presence of this attribute on certain fish may help confirm that they are male.


This is an appropriate way to identify the sex of mollies, guppies, swordtails, platies, and wags., Some male fish, like cichlid species, have dorsal and anal fins larger than their female counterparts. By comparing several different examples of the same fish, you’ll be able to determine the sex of a cichlid fish.


Cichlid fish include tilapia, angelfish, oscars, and discus., Some male fish, like goldfish, develop many small bumps on them during the spring. These bumps usually develop on the forehead, near the gills, and on the pectoral fins. These bumps will disappear at the end of breeding season, in the early summer.


Bumps may vary in size and color, depending on the species., With some species, like koi, female fish may be larger. This is especially true during spawning time, when females will appear more full-bodied and may have larger abdomens.


The roundness of a female fish is often a result of an accumulation of eggs or fry. , During breeding season, male fish will tend to grow or develop attributes that make them flashier. It is important to note, though, that female fish may develop similar features but to a less extreme extent.


Male pleco fish, for example, will grow long bristles on their pectoral fins as well as around the edge of their mouth and head. While females will grow similar bristles, they’ll tend to be smaller., Aggressive behavior can be identified as being very territorial. In addition, aggressive fish may swim quickly at other fish that come near them. Sometimes, males are more aggressive than females. However, sometimes behavior may not tell you much at all about sex.


Male pleco fish may be more aggressive. This, though, might vary based on the type of pleco fish. Some common names of pleco fish include: algae suckers, janitor fish, and suckermouth catfish."

Read about a specific species of fish.,
Talk to a professional or expert.,
Watch videos.",How to Determine the Sex of a Fish2," While there are some general traits you can look for when trying to determine the sex of a fish, the best way to determine sex is to read about the specific fish in question. When doing this:


Visit your local library. Your local library may have several books on specific fish and their physiology.
Consult books like the Encyclopedia of Fish Physiology, available online or at your local library., Workers at fish stores, veterinarians, or biologists may be able to provide you with insight on a specific fish’s sex. If you have difficulty determining the sex of a fish, you should seek help from a professional.


Visit a local fish store – the more fish they have the better – with a picture of the fish and ask store employees if they can help identify the sex of the fish. If the store carries the specifies of fish in question, they’ll likely be able to help you.

, There are a wide variety of videos on the internet or television about fish and how to determine their sex. Take some time to search the internet for videos that might be helpful. You may wind up learning a lot about fish physiology and reproduction.


Watch videos on YouTube.
Think about shows on Animal Planet or National Geographic.

Remove your fish from the tank.,
Remove the accessories from your tank.,
Rinse the gravel with treated water.,
Replace the gravel on the floor of the tank.,
Set your tank back up.",How to Clean Fish Tank Rocks1," If you have a single small fish, such as a goldfish or a beta, it is easier to remove it from the tank for gravel cleaning. Fill a clean container as close to the size of your fish tank as possible with non-chlorinated water. Use a drinking glass or a fish net to gently move your fish from the tank to the container., Unhook your water filter, and remove any plants or decorations from your fish tank. Set these aside. The tank should be full of only water and gravel before you begin cleaning., Gently pour the water from your fish tank through a colander. Under a stream of lukewarm water, agitate the colander to loosen and wash away any stubborn debris. Do this several times until the water coming off your gravel runs clean and clear., When the gravel is clean, spread it evenly back over the bottom of your fish tank. Reattach your water filter and set up any decorations as desired.

, Refill your fish tank with non-chlorinated water.If your breed of fish necessitates any other particular requirements, such as water of a certain PH, treat your tank accordingly. When everything is in place, gently submerge your fish and its holding container in the tank, letting your fish swim free.


Consult your local pet store for more information about the water requirements of your particular fish.

Do not drain more than 25% of the water from the tank.Doing so can upset the balance of good bacteria in the tank.,
Discard the dirty water.,
Refill your tank.",How to Clean Fish Tank Rocks2," If you have many fish or exotic breeds, do not remove your fish from the tank for gravel cleaning. Doing so for the extended period of time required to clean a larger tank can be stressful for the fish. It’s also not necessary when using a gravel siphon, a special gravel-cleaning tool for larger tanks that you are going to use., Buy a clean bucket that you only use for fish tank maintenance. Place it at a lower level than the aquarium so gravity can do most of the work for you.Do not use a household bucket that might have chemicals from prior cleaning projects. Although you are only using this bucket to discard fish water, it’s really best to keep your pet’s supplies separate to avoid confusion.

, Place the cylinder end of the gravel siphon in the tank, such that the opening is resting at the bottom in the gravel. Guide the plastic tubing at the other end over the edge of the tank, holding it in your hand over the waiting bucket., Immediately place the end of the tube in the waiting bucket after doing this. As soon as you suck, negative pressure will be created in the tube, and dirty fish tank water will flow through the tubing to the bucket. This is what you want but be careful not to suck too long, as you might get a mouthful of aquarium water.If you can’t stomach sucking on the tubing, some siphons make special priming balls that start the siphon for you. Seek one out at your local pet or aquarium store.
If you do end up drinking a little water, rest assured this is not harmful.

, Once the siphon is going, you don’t need to do anything to maintain the pressure. While the water flows freely, press the open, submerged end of the siphon down into the gravel. Move from one end of the tank to the other, pressing the mouth of the siphon down into the gravel with a circling motion to vacuum up debris.The suction may lift a piece of gravel or two into the cylinder of the siphon, but it will not be able to suck it into the tubing; simply shake loose any gravel bits that rise up.You should see matter being sucked out of the gravel as you work. If you don’t, press the opening deeper into the gravel.
As you move the siphon about the tank, be careful not to bump or frighten your fish. Work slowly.

, Plus, your fish are still in there, and they need it even though you’re cleaning., Once you have vacuumed the gravel to your satisfaction, remove the gravel siphon and set it aside. Discard the dirty water in the bucket by pouring it into your sink or into your toilet. Wash the siphon in hot water.

, Once gravel cleaning is complete, refill your tank to its normal level with non-chlorinated water.If your fish have any special requirements, such as PH adjustments, be sure to perform those as well.

Change your aquarium filter per the manufacturer’s directions.,
Clean your gravel every two weeks.,
Avoid using detergents or harsh cleaners.",How to Clean Fish Tank Rocks3," Keeping on top of water-filter changes will prevent your gravel from collecting extra grime. Make a calendar reminder to help you remember to change it regularly.


It can be helpful to let your new and old aquarium filters run in tandem for a couple days to keep from changing the ecosystem of your tank too rapidly., Clean your gravel every other week to maintain the healthy of your fish and your tank. Doing so more often is unnecessary and may remove beneficial bacteria from the environment., Most commercial cleaning solutions are toxic to fish. Always wash your gravel with plain, non-chlorinated water. If your gravel is so dirty that these methods are not cleaning it, buy new gravel rather than trying a stronger solution."

This means that for every inch of fish in your tank, you will need a full gallon of water. So, a five-inch fish requires at least a five-gallon tank. Keep in mind that if you get a school of fish, you will need even more room.It is a good idea to get a tank that is at least 20 gallons. This is a manageable size for a beginner fish-keeper. This also means that the tiny bowls sold in fish stores are too small to ensure the long-term health of your fish.The inch a gallon rule is general. Keep in mind some fish (like goldfish) create a lot of waste, or need more space.;
, Get a fish that can be replaced rather easily and cheaply, just in case something goes wrong. Saltwater fish are more expensive and require much more equipment than freshwater. In contrast, a corydora catfish is readily available and won’t break the bank.Tetras, Cory Cats, and Black Mollies are inexpensive options as well. You can also compare prices to find the best deal.

, You want a fish that isn’t easy to kill. One that can survive small mistakes in cleaning or care. For example, overfeeding is a common problem that can kill many fish breeds rather easily. With this in mind, Paradise fish are a hardy, beautiful option.Siamese fighting fish are cousins of goldfish and make excellent first-time pets. They prefer a good amount of aquarium décor and are often found lounging amongst the plants, making for great viewing., Some fish require the socialization of schools whereas others just prefer to be left alone. The Ember tetra is a great beginner fish, but it does best when included in a group of six or more. Try to find out about the best environment for the fish before buying., Your child may want a bright, colorful fish that they can track throughout the tank. A tetra is always a good option if this is the case. Or, your child may be more interested in a fish that has a unique shape with unusual fins, such as a Paradise fish.

, This is usually the first fish that jumps to mind for a child’s pet. However, they can live for a long time and they can actually grow to quite a large size, if given the proper space and conditions. So, keeping a goldfish in a small tank actually limits the growth and well-being of the fish itself.A healthy goldfish in a large environment can grow upwards of eight inches long.

, Pet stores carry a wide variety of fish that you can walk in and purchase directly. The benefit here is that you’ll get to see your fish face-to-face prior to making a purchase. Online fish dealers, in contrast, offer a wider variety of fish, but you’ll have to wait a bit for your fish to arrive. You also won’t get to pick a particular fish.

, Regardless of who you buy from, make sure to do some consumer research prior to purchasing. Check with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to see if the business has any current consumer complaints. Look online for reviews on a site such as Yelp.It is doubly important to do your research when buying from an online dealer. They may or may not offer a refund if you receive a sickly fish.

, If you visit an aquarium or pet store, you should approach one of the employees and ask them about how to care for your fish. Talk to them about the pH level needs of each type of fish. Ask if they have any care tips or ideas about what food each fish prefers. If the employee is not that knowledgeable or helpful, you may want to go elsewhere.

, As you walk in front of the tanks, take a good look at each of them. See if you notice a good amount of debris in the water or algae on the tanks. Take a quick smell and notice if there is a fishy or stinky odor present. Look to see if the heaters and filters are all installed correctly and functioning., Not all fish are the same. You want a fish that is swimming actively, but not frantically. You want a fish with a consistent, bright color and a body without any lumps or unusual spots. The fish should have all of its scales and show no signs of outward flesh damage. The stomach should be smooth and in line with the rest of the body., From the first step onward, ask your child about their preferences and see if you can accommodate them. For example, if they prefer to choose a fish in person, then visit an aquarium store. Keeping your child interested in the process will also make them more likely to take care of the fish in the long term., Prior to the fish arriving home, you’ll want to install your heater, light, and filtration system in your tank. You’ll also want to add any decorations or substrate. At least 24 hours before your fish arrives, treat the water in your tank with a conditioning chemical and let it sit. This will ensure that the water is safe for your fish., Before you add the fish to the tank, cycle the fish tank. Cycling the tank ensures that there is the proper amount of bacteria in the water for the fish to thrive. Some bacteria is good for fish, and it will help break down their waste product. It will take a month to cycle the water.

One common way to cycle the aquarium without any fish is to heat the water to 80 °F (27 °C) before adding fish food. The food will decay over a few days, releasing ammonia into the water. As soon as the ammonia levels drop down to 0 ppm, you can add the fish.
There are some species of fish that do not require you to fully cycle the water before you put them in the tank. Always consider the type of fish that you are purchasing before setting up the tank.

, When you transfer your fish make sure to float the bag in the tank for at least 10 to 15 minutes. This will allow your fish to get accustomed to the new water temperature and environment. Then, open the bag at the top and gently scoop the fish out and into the tank water. Dispose of the bag.Try to avoid letting any of the bag water into the tank. The bag could contain infections from the store that you do not want loose in your tank.

, You will want to talk with your child about the importance of feeding a fish very slowly and cautiously. If you or your child overfeeds your fish, essentially giving it more than it can eat in a single meal, take the net and skim the remaining food from the top of the tank., You will want to do a partial water change of your tank at least every two weeks. Make this part of a regular cleaning routine and get your child involved by asking them to hold the drain hose or scrub off any dirty decorations.Make sure to also test the water regularly to ensure that the pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are in the proper range for your type of fish.

, This can be a simple chart that shows feedings and cleanings by the week. As your child completes each task, give them a sticker to place on top of the completed chore on the chart. This will keep them engaged in the upkeep and care of the fish, while making fish-related chores fun as well."

Learn about fish.,
Once you have learned the basic care of fish, take a trip to your fish store to see what is available near you.,
When you get home, learn about the fish you liked at the store.,
Decide on which fish you would like to keep from your list.,
Buy the fish.,
Introduce the fish to their new home.",How to Choose a Pet Fish," Get books from the library, talk to people in pet stores, do research on the internet about fish. Some good sites are www.Fishlore.com, www.Aquahobby.com, www.seriouslyfish.com, www.fishprofiles.com and www.Badmanstropicalfish.com. Learn how to take care of them.;
, You might want to tour several, and see which one you think has the healthiest fish, most knowledgeable staff and best range of products. Write down the names of the fish you like - if you aren't sure the name of a fish, ask the employees. If they can't tell you the name of the fish, your attention is probably best of at another shop. Remember - thousands of fish store workers don't really know what they're talking about as they are often dreadfully misinformed and given no form of training - sometimes even the shop owner doesn't know the proper care of fish as they have spent no time researching them and has never kept fish at home!

, Look online or in books. Find out how big they grow, what size tank they need, what they eat, what temperature they like their water, what pH they like their water, if they are peaceful or aggressive, if they are compatible with the other fish you like, how hardy they are (how forgiving they are of mistakes, like a missed water change), what water level they swim in, if they need to be kept in a school (a group of at least 5-6) or if they will breed in the aquarium.

, Now you have the information on them, you can decide what species you want to keep in what numbers. Make sure you don't overstock the tank, and all the fish that need a school have a school. A good general guideline for stocking small peaceful fish is 1"" of fish per gallon. This is to be used with common sense however - no 10 inch fish in 10 gallon (37.9 L) tanks! You must also alter this guideline for territorial fish, as even if the tank is properly stocked numbers wise, it might not work if all the fish need a big territory! It is generally best to ask around on online forums about your stocking list as you will get lots of opinions from knowledgeable people.


Using your research, buy an appropriate aquarium along with a filter, heater, thermometer and decorations. Then cycle your tank.

, Don't get them all at once! Don't get more than 6 at a time, so you don't overload your tank and you give it time to build up its bacteria colony's that keep ammonia and nitrites (don't know about these? You need to research the Nitrogen cycle!) at bay. Remember to wait 2 weeks before introducing more.

, When you get the bag of fish home, float the bag in the tank for about 20 minutes to let the water in the bag slowly reach the same temperature as your tank. Then snip top of bag open and gently pour fish into tank. Enjoy your new pets!

Move hardy plants to deeper water, at least 18 inches (45.72 cm), but preferably deeper, to keep them from freezing. If the pond freezes entirely, remove these plants and store them indoors for the winter.






Move tropical lilies out of the pond to a place where they won't freeze, like a basement or heated garage. If the lilies are in pots without drainage holes, keep them well-watered. If they are in pots with drainage holes, repot them in pots without draining holes. Check water levels at least once each week, adding water as needed, to make sure that the lilies don't dry out.
Remove other tender plants from the pond, wrapping each plant loosely with damp newspaper. Place them in large trash bags and store them with the lilies. Check the newspaper every week or two to be sure it is still moist, but not soaking wet.







,


Moving the filter close to the surface of the pond so that the air bubbles breaking the surface of the water may prevent the pond from freezing completely. Alternatively, remove and store the pond filter indoors for the winter.

,


Once the plants that need to be moved have been, vacuum the pond to clear out dead plants and other debris in order to prevent toxic gases from being produced that can be lethal to fish.

, If your pond contains fish, reduce the amount of food you feed the fish as the temperature gets colder.

Stop feeding the fish completely when the temperature drops below 50F (10C) to keep the fish from creating more waste products that the remaining plants can process. Since the fish will be in semi-hibernation, there should be enough nutrients in the pond for them to survive the winter.







,


Keep the pond clean from falling leaves and branches by covering it with a screen for the winter. This will also make pond preparation in the spring much easier. Shade cloth, netting, and landscape fabric work well. Be sure to secure the screen around all edges of the pond.

Remove organic debris.,
Run the filter.,
Test the pool water.,
Shock the water with chlorine.,
Dilute the water.,
Use a pool clarifier.,
Address possible filter problems.",How to Remove Turbidity1," Use a pool net to fish out any large, visible debris in the water. Organic debris commonly includes leaves, branches, and dead insects.


Organic debris can decay and add sediment to the water. The dirt on the debris can also cause cloudiness.;
, Keep the pool filter running 24 hours a day, seven days a week until the water is clear again.


If the pressure gauge is 8 to 10 lbs (3.6 to 4.5 kg) higher than it is at the pool's clean starting pressure, you should backwash or clean the filter.
As long as the pressure has not reached these levels, though, you should let the filter remain dirty. Some dirt and debris in a filter can actually be helpful since it can make it easier for the filter to trap small particles.

, Determine the pool water's pH, chlorine composition, and cyanuric acid levels. After testing it, you can make any necessary adjustments to correct off levels.


A home testing kit is usually sufficient.
If you do not have a home testing kit or if you suspect that the results might be inaccurate, take a sample of the water to a local pool store for professional testing.
Chlorine levels should be between 1.0 and 3.0 ppm, and pH levels should be between 7.2 and 7.4. Cyanuric acid levels should be at about 40 ppm.
Also pay attention to the levels of calcium hardness and total alkalinity.

, If the amount of chlorine in your pool is remarkably low, you can shock the water by adding 3 lbs (1.35 kg) of granular chlorine per 10,000 gallons (2500 L) of water.


Low chlorine levels are among the most common causes of turbidity in pool water. The sunlight can damage chlorine and make it less effective. When this happens, bacteria can build up in the water, causing it to become cloudy.
If you tested the water and the chlorine levels are only slightly lower than usual, you can correct them by adding the amount of chlorine called for on the label instructions. Shocking the water is only necessary when the chlorine is abnormally and severely low.

, If you have a high level of cyanuric acid in the water, shocking it with chlorine may not be enough. Lower the cyanuric acid levels by draining 20 percent of the water and refilling the pool with fresh water.


Too little cyanuric acid can make it easier for the sun to break down the chlorine in your pool, creating water that is less resistant to dirt and bacteria. As such, you should only dilute the pool water if your cyanuric acid levels are at 100 ppm or above.

, When all else fails, you can try correcting the cloudiness by adding a ""pool clarifier"" chemical. Dosage of these chemicals vary by manufacturer, so check the label for instructions before proceeding.


Clarifier chemicals bind and coagulate small particles, making it easier for filters to trap them.

, If none of these solutions fix the turbidity, there might be a problem with your filter. Diagnose and correct this problem before trying again.


Make sure that your filter is not undersized for your pool.
Verify that the filter media is still active and not in need of replacement.
Check the pressure. Abnormally low pressure could indicate a clog or blockage in the filter. It could also indicate a damaged backwash valve.
If you have a DE filter, disassemble it and clean the entire thing thoroughly. Look for tears or other damage as you clean it.

"
Change some of the water.,
Reduce the amount of food.,
Add aquarium chemicals.,
Mix in some gravel.,
Check the filter.",How to Remove Turbidity2," Until the water clears, change up to 20 percent of it on a daily basis. Remove some of the dirty water and immediately replace it with fresh water.


Do not change more than 20 percent of the water in one day. Changing more can shock you fish and cause them to become ill or die.
Changing out some of the water removes at least some of the waste. The bacteria thriving in your water then begin to starve, thereby creating cleaner water.
After the water clears, you only need to change water once every two weeks or so.

, If your fish do not regularly eat all of the food you put in the tank, reduce the amount of food by 5 to 10 percent.


When fish food breaks down, its particles can make the water dirty. The decayed food can also breed bacteria.
Check on the aquarium 10 minutes or so after you feed your fish. If the fish have stopped eating at that point, use a net to remove any uneaten food.

, Too many chemicals can hurt your fish, but regular doses of aquarium salt, water conditioner, or quick cure can help clear your water. These chemicals are formulated to clear debris and correct bacteria levels.


Follow the dosage on your box of aquarium salt and apply the salt once.
Follow the dosage on the bottle of conditioner and apply it each day until te water clears.
Use half a dose of quick cure each day until the water clears.
Only use one of these chemicals at a time. Mixing chemicals can hurt the ecosystem of your aquarium.

, Sprinkle a handful of gravel from an established aquarium into your tank. Wait roughly 24 to 48 hours and note the results.


Established gravel has beneficial bacteria on it. Unlike the harmful bacteria living in your tank, this bacteria can digest waste and balance out its harmful cousins.
Beneficial bacteria also helps to establish a bacteria colony in your filter. When a colony grows in your filter, it attracts and draws bacteria out of the tank itself, clearing up the water.
The gravel must come from an established tank with health fish. You can usually purchase some from a store that sells fish if you do not know anyone who can give you some for free.

, The aquarium must have a power filter, and that filter must be clean and working properly.


Feel the outside of the filter. If it seems abnormally warm, it might be clogged or damaged.
Check the instructions for your particular filter model to determine the proper way to clean it.

"
"
Add cured hay.,
Use gypsum.,
Keep livestock animals out.,
Balance the pond ecosystem.,
Protect the pond from run-off.",How to Remove Turbidity3," Spread two square bales of hay per surface acre every two weeks throughout the spring and supper. Do not apply more than four times per year.


Cured hay can be used to remove clay turbidity.
For best results, use alfalfa, red clover, bermuda, or other legume hay.
Pull apart the bales of hay and evenly scatter the pieces in the shallow water around the edge of the pond.
As the hay decomposes, it produces organic acids and positive ions that can neutralize the negative clay ions.
Hay stimulates helpful bacteria growth. Do not apply the hay too often, however, since it can deplete the oxygen in the water and kill some of the fish living there. For that reason, it is also best to use hay in ponds that have low levels of natural organic materials.

, Apply 500 lb (225 kg) per acre foot of water. If this initial dose does not clear the water within four weeks, apply a second dose of 125 lb (56.25 kg) per acre foot.


Gypsum is also used to clear clay turbidity. It attracts clay particles, binding them and preventing them from settling.
Use a small shovel to evenly spread the gypsum over the pond.
Gypsum is chemically known as calcium sulfate. As a calcium compound, this treatment is generally not effective if you have hard water, which already contains large amounts of calcium.

, Grazing livestock can easily cause turbidity, but you can solve the problem by building a fence around the pond to keep the animals out.


When livestock approaches the pond, debris from the shoreline can get into the water and cause cloudiness.
If you need the livestock to be able to drink to water, you should siphon the water into a separate tank. You could also fence off all but a small corner of the pond, which should limit the access and debris getting stirred to one spot while still allowing the animals access to the water source.

, Bottom feeding aquatic animals and marine life that burrows into the sediment can stir debris and cause excessively cloudy water when left unchecked.


Possible sources of trouble include crayfish, aquatic insects, common carp, an bullhead catfish.
You can control crayfish and insects by introducing predator species to the water. Some options include the largemouth bass and channel catfish.
Large numbers of catfish or other bottom feeding fish can be controlled by fishing some out with dough balls or other baits. You can also control populations of catfish by introducing competing fish species, like largemouth bass and bluegill.

, Wind, waves, soil erosion, and watershed sources can all cause debris run-off in your pond, and that run-off will create turbid water.


To minimize watershed run-off, keep a vegetated ground cover around the perimeter of the pond, extending at least 100 feet (30.5 m) around. Sod grass is usually a good choice.
Reduce wind run-off by spreading crushed rock along the shorelines receiving the largest, strongest gusts of wind.
You can also plant trees or shrubs around the pond to block the wind, concentrating on the upwind side of the pond. Plant aquatic vegetation on the downwind side to reduce wave erosion.
Never plant trees on a dam, however, since the roots can damage the structure.
If there is a stream leading into the pond, install sediment traps further upstream to catch additional run-off.

Choose a uv sterilizer with a low-pressure ultraviolet lamp.,
Choose a uv sterilizer with a 3 or 5 inch (7.6 or 12.7 cm) diameter body.,
Choose a uv sterilizer that positions the ultraviolet lamp entirely between the water inlet and outlet ports.,
Choose a uv sterilizer that utilizes a quartz sleeve.,
Choose a uv sterilizer with a water flow rate based on end-of-lamp-life performance.,
Choose a uv sterilizer with a remote power supply.",How to Purchase a Quality Ultraviolet (UV) Sterilizer for Aquariums and Ponds," -- Low-pressure lamps are much better in aquatic uv sterilizers and clarifiers. Low-pressure lamps produce virtually all of their UV output at a wavelength of 254 nanometers, which is very close to the peak germicidal wavelength of 264 nanometers. Low-pressure lamps typically run on low-input power (saving you money on the electric bill) and operate at temperatures between 100º and 200º Fahrenheit. They have a useful life of 8,000 to 12,000 hours, depending on the operating current of the lamp. Low-pressure lamps are also better for uv water sterilizers because they are long and therefore have more ARC length. As a general rule, the longer the lamp, the greater amount of UV light the water will receive because it will be exposed to the UV source for a longer period of time.;
, -- The design of the UV sterilizer's water exposure chamber (body) is the primary design criteria that will determine the unit's ""UV dose rate"" at any given water flow rate. Select a unit with the right diameter body compared to the wattage you are considering. A unit with a larger diameter will have a greater contact time, but if the body is too large the water furthest from the lamp could receive diminished uv intensity. If the body is too small you could be wasting valuable uv light and, in turn, money on the electric bill, again. For example, 25-watt standard-output T5 low-pressure lamp has an ideal diameter body of 3 inches (7.6 cm), while an 80-watt high-output T6 low-pressure lamp has an ideal diameter body of 5 inches (12.7 cm). This has been proven via scientific tests by independent companies like Bolton Photosciences, Inc. and the EPA.

, -- Any portion of the UV lamp that is not located between the water ports is rendered useless by fluid dynamics. Wasted UV-C light will reduce the efficiency of the uv sterilizer and/or clarifier. And for a third time, will affect your cost efficiency as well.

, -- The quartz sleeve is needed to isolate the UV lamp from the water to avoid possible shock and damage from the lamp's electrical components getting wet. The quartz sleeve is also important because it allows the uv lamp to operate at its optimum temperature through insulation.

, -- The end-of-lamp-life rating takes into account the lamp losing UV-C output due to age and therefore is a more realistic projection of how the unit will perform over time. This also slows the water flow rate down to ensure your aquarium or pond water is getting enough uv exposure to eliminate your harmful bacteria and algae microorganisms.

, -- The power supply should be positioned remotely on the cord and away from the uv sterilizer body and the aquatic application. The power supply needs to be as dry as possible to avoid damage to the unit and the chance of electric shock situations.

Replace the water in your pond every 6 months.,
Remove debris from your pond as needed.,
Clean the filter in your pond on a regular basis.,
Add plants to your pond that oxygenate naturally.,
Install an aeration device to encourage oxygen flow.",How to Oxygenate Plants in a Pond," Replacing old water with fresh water will improve and replenish the oxygen in your pond overall.


Remove one-third of your old pond water and replace that amount with fresh water that does not contain chlorine or other chemicals that are harmful to your plants or fish.





;
, Debris such as leaves or twigs can deplete the oxygen from your pond and plants at a fast rate.


Use a pond net, skimmer net, or water vacuum to remove debris from the surface and bottom of your pond.







, A clean filter will help maintain the oxygen in your pond by supporting water flow and movement, and by removing excess waste.


Clean the filter as needed according to the manufacturer's directions, when the water flow slows down, when the filter becomes blocked with debris, or before you plan on being away from home for an extended period of time.






Replace the old filter with a new filter once per year to maintain the quality of the filter.

, Oxygenator plants will naturally add oxygen to your pond to help support your other pond plants, and will also help reduce algae growth.


Place oxygenator plants such as anacharis, cabomba, moneywort, tapegrass, hygrophilia, water hornwort, ludwigia, sagittaria, and vallisneria into your pond.

, Aeration devices such as fountains, bubblers, waterfalls, diffusers, or air pumps will help circulate your pond water and increase the oxygen levels needed for your plants and fish.

Consult with the manual for your aeration device or with its manufacturer to determine how to install the device in your pond.

Clean your pump’s filters out regularly.Most filters require cleaning once each week.,
Manually clean your pond.The cheapest but most time-consuming method of removing algae is to go out each day, or every few days, and check for algae.,
Feed your fish properly.Feeding your fish properly involves choosing the right feed and feeding in the right amounts.",How to Keep Your Pond Clean1," Usually, cleaning is a simple matter of removing the filter, spraying it down with a hose, and replacing it.However, you should always follow manufacturer instructions when deciding how and how often to clean your filter.


If you notice your pump leaking or struggling noisily, you probably need to clean it.If your filter has a gauge on it, clean it when the back-pressure reaches four to five pounds.
Failure to clean your filter regularly will result in it working less efficiently, and leave your pond dirty.;
, If you see any, use a rake or a long stick to remove it directly from the water. If you choose to employ this method, you must be vigilant and check the pond on a regular basis.


Remove leaves and debris floating on the water. Most leaves, twigs, seeds, and loose grasses can be removed with a pond skimmer, a kind of long-handled net specifically designed to keep ponds and pools clean. These are readily available at most home care stores.
Clean the bottom of the pond.You can use a pond vacuum or a wet vacuum to clean the bottom. A pond vacuum is a device that allows you to suck up leaves, algae, sludge, and other debris that you don’t want in the bottom of your pond. They are readily available at most home improvement stores.

, If you have fish in your pond, selecting a high-quality fish feed will prevent the growth of algae, as the food will be more fully digested, and your fish will produce less waste. In order to ensure your fish eat all the food they’re given, check for food floating on the surface about twenty minutes after you’re done feeding them.


If you see food bits still floating in the water, you’ll know that you’re overfeeding and should gradually reduce the amount of feed you’re providing to a level where you do not see feed floating on the surface after feeding is complete. Excess food will rot and give algae nutrients it can use to grow.
The type of feed you choose to give your fish depends on the species, though most commercially available feeds are appropriate for multiple species. Talk to the proprietor of your local pet store or your vet if you have questions about what type of feed is best for your fish.
Reduce the amount of feed you give your fish in autumn and winter. During these seasons, their metabolism slows and they’ll require less food."

Use a biological filter.A biological filter uses bacteria to remove organic waste that can accumulate in your pond.,
Add barley straw to your pond.As barley straw decomposes, it releases a chemical that prevents algae from growing.,
Add plants to the pond.You could add both floating plants and submerged plants to your pond.",How to Keep Your Pond Clean2," You could get an in-pond filter or an external filter.In-pond filters have a pump attached to a fountain that runs into the pond. While they are easy to set up and install, they are difficult to clean because you must remove the entire contraption from the pond.
External filters are very easy to clean, but it can be difficult to get the right size and pump, since they are usually designed for pools, not ponds.
While these bacteria occur naturally in ponds, they are not present in the quantities necessary to adequately filter all the toxins that occur in most ponds.
Get a filter capable of filtering about twice the amount of water that our pond contains. For instance, if a filter says it can adequately filter 3,000 liters, you should use it only if your pond is around 1,500 liters or less. If you get a filter that matches your pond’s volume exactly, it will struggle to keep the pond clean.
Your filter should filter your entire pond in about two hours. Check the speed of the pump and compare it to your pond’s volume to choose the right one., One bale of barley straw treats 1,000 gallons of water. In other words, if your pond holds 100 gallons, you’d need only one-tenth of a bale. The best way to add the straw is to wrap a softball-sized portion of straw in mesh netting and toss the balled-up straw in the pond.


Alternatively, you could add liquid barley straw. One tablespoon usually treats about 50 gallons. If you don’t notice a change after about a week, add more gradually.
Barley straw is readily available at most garden centers.
Barley straw is safe for use in ponds with fish.

, Both will keep algae at bay and keep your pond clean in a natural way.


Add floating plants. Lillies and lotus reduce the total surface area of the pond that algae can thrive on, and absorb nutrients that algae would otherwise use to grow.
Submerged plants like hornwort, parrot’s feather, and anacharis add oxygen to the water, preventing algae. They can be kept below the water’s surface by attaching them to a rock or putting them in a plant pot and adding weight until it sinks.

"
"
Add water treatments.Water treatments are chemical formulas designed to block or remove algae.,
Add calcium sulfate.,
Introduce a moving water fixture.,
Get an ultraviolet (UV) clarifier.UV clarifiers are special pumps that pull pond water into a chamber where the water is exposed to ultraviolet light.",How to Keep Your Pond Clean3," They are typically safe for use with fish and invertebrates like snails, but will harm tadpoles. Specific directions for use vary with the particular product you choose to use in your pond. Always follow manufacturer directions when adding water treatments to your pond.


Water treatments will need to be re-applied from time to time, so just add more as necessary when you notice algae or green water.

, Calcium sulfate, also known as gypsum, is useful for breaking up pond sludge that accumulates at the bottom of the pond. Sprinkle the calcium sulfate evenly across the surface of the pond at a concentration of 525 pounds per acre-foot of water.Calcium sulfate is readily available at most gardening centers.
Calcium sulfate will not harm your fish or pond plants.

, With moving water, your pond will be less likely to accrue algae and grime. You could add a fountain or waterfall to your pond. With either fixture, ensure it is placed next to the pond so that water will return to it. Fountains could be placed in the middle of the pond if the pond’s depth does not exceed the height of the fountain.


If you install a fountain or waterfall less than three feet high, the pump should be located next to the waterfall on the ground level. If you install a waterfall five feet tall or taller, the filter should be placed just behind the waterfall at an elevation equal to its highest point., The light kills suspended algae (but not string algae) in the water and allows you to easily remove any algae detritus.


UV clarifiers can be attached to either mechanical or biological filters.
UV light is harmful to human eyes, so the UV bulb will be situated within a case. Do not disassemble or remove the case from the UV clarifier.
A clarifier with 8-10 watts of UV light is appropriate for 1,000 gallons of water."

Decide when a deep cleaning is necessary.,
Pump water out of the pond.,
Remove your fish.After you’ve removed most of the water from the pond, transfer your fish to the holding container(s).,
Finish emptying the pond.,
Refill the pond.",How to Keep Your Pond Clean4," If there are many dead leaves and a lot of sludge at the bottom of the pond that you can’t easily remove with a pond vacuum, you’ll need to empty the pond entirely.If you can easily remove debris at the bottom of the pond, a complete cleaning is not necessary.


You should empty and deeply clean your pond at least once a year. The best times to do this are in the spring (so you can remove debris that accumulated during winter) and in the fall (when you’re getting ready to winterize your pond)., You can buy or rent a water pump from most home improvement stores. Ensure the pump has a long extended hose or handle so the pump will reach to an appropriate depth in your pond. To avoid wasting the water, direct it to a garden at the back of your house or to the lawn.


Place some of the pond water in a large tub, inflatable swimming pool, or other large container if you have fish. This water will serve as your holding tank for your fish while the pond is empty., The water level should be high enough that the fish can still swim around, but low enough that you can walk easily in it. Water of about a half-meter in depth is a good level at which to remove the fish.


Remove your fish with a fish net. Scoop the fish out and place them in the container holding pond water you filled earlier.
You might need to place netting or mesh over the container holding the fish to ensure they don’t leap out.

, Once the pond is empty, begin removing the aquatic plants from the pond. If any of the plants need water to survive, put them in a holding tank. Scoop up and remove any dead plants or plant material.


Clean the pond while it is empty. Wash the grime from the bottom and sides of the pond with a pressurized water spray gun.Don’t use bleach or any toxic chemicals on your pond.

, Fill the pond up with clean water. Add a dechlorinating agent to the water.Dechlorinator is a solution designed to remove chlorine from water that comes out of your hose. This is important because chlorine in the water will kill fish. Replace your plants and fish in the pond.


Dechlorinators are readily available at most pet stores. The amount you need will depend on the size of your pond. Consult manufacturer directions for specific use.
To acclimate your fish to the new water, take one gallon of water out of the holding tank and add about one gallon of the new pond water to it every five minutes. After about 30 minutes, transfer the fish back into the pond.

Plant the lotus rhizomes once the water is at the correct temperature.,
Care for the lotus plant as it grows.,
Prevent the pond water from becoming stagnant.",How to Make a Lotus Pond1," Lotus do best in a large bog-type pond in a sunny area of the garden.


Expect the lotus plants to grow pretty big and wide: leaves are up to 2 feet (0.6 m) across unless you try growing a dwarf lotus. They’ll also grow fairly tall.
If you are growing a regular variety, your pond will need to be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) across and at least 18 inches (45.7 cm) deep to provide the lotus plant with enough space
It’s best to wait until the winter is over before digging your pond so the ground is easier to work.;
, Decide whether you are using a rigid plastic pond liner or a flexible material liner that you can cut to fit. Dig out the space for your pond and line with whatever you are using.


If using pond lining fabric, make sure there’s 12 inches (30.5 cm) of material running over the edges of your pond hole.
You then need to bury the excess liner at the margins of your pond under some dirt, stones, gravel or flagstones. This both hides the material and weighs it down.

, You now want to add a mix of compost/topsoil and well-rotted manure to a depth of 9 inches (22.9 cm). Cover this with one or two inches of sand and/or gravel or lava rock.


Lining the edges of the pond with large river rocks will also look nice – just be careful not to stretch or tear the pond liner.

, If you only have tap water, leave it to stand for a few days to reduce the chemical level (especially important if you plan to add fish).


Avoid gushing water into the pond as this will unsettle the layers of sand, gravel and dirt and make the water muddy.
You’ll need to wait until the temperature of the water is above 70 °F (21 °C) before you can think about planting your lotus into the bottom.

, When you are ready to plant, place a lotus rhizome onto the layer of sand at the bottom of the pond and weigh it down with a handful of gravel.


Alternatively, in a larger-sized pond you can plant the rhizome into a big planter to keep the lotus contained in that area.

, Lotus are hungry plants that need fertilizing during the summer months. You can get special water fertilizing tablets online or in some garden stores.


Start fertilizing at half strength in June then through the rest of the summer apply full strength fertilizer. In the fall, around October, the plant will go dormant. Once the leaves brown and wither away or fall off, you can clean the pond.
Lotus are frost-hardy, but in cooler areas consider moving container-planted lotus to deeper water. This is because the deeper water is less likely to freeze.

, Mosquitoes may use stagnant water to breed in. You might like to use chemical controls (available on Amazon) or consider installing a fountain to keep the water moving, thus making it less attractive for breeding insects.

Plant the lotus in a container to prevent it from spreading.,
Choose an appropriate container.,
Ensure that there are at least 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of water above the surface of the container.",How to Make a Lotus Pond2," You don’t need to plant the lotus rhizomes directly into the bottom of the pond, you can also plant them in a container, which you can then put in the pond.


Planting lotus in a container is a good idea in a fish pond, as it helps the contain the lotus' spread.
A half barrel or big planter will also do fine for this.

, It’s important to use a round container so the corners don’t choke up as the lotus spreads into them. Don’t choose containers that have drainage holes: the water will come from the top not the bottom.


Also avoid using regular basket-type mesh planters that are commonly used to contain aquatic plants. The fragile lotus growing points will get snared up in any gap or corner and will be damaged.
Black absorbs heat well and A black plastic, round planter at least 30 inches (76.2 cm) wide and 6 inches (15.2 cm) deep (without drainage holes) is best.for lotus. The color is important, as black helps to absorb heat.

, Plant the lotus rhizomes into your container and place the container into the pond so the top of the soil in the container is 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) below the surface of the water.

Ensure that the water is shallow enough for the lotus.,
Protect the lotus rhizomes from being eaten by the fish.,
Prevent the lotus from choking up your fish pond.,
Make sure the fish have enough space.",How to Make a Lotus Pond3," Lotus need fairly shallow water so if you have a deeper fish pond you will either need to have a shallow end for lotus or plant them in a container that is raised on blocks under the water.

, Larger fish will eat lotus – Koi carp in particular. Therefore, you need to make sure that the planting bed is weighed down with sand and lava rocks or gravel to prevent them accessing the lotus tubers.

, Fish need clean, fresh, oxygenated water, food (usually on the surface), hiding places and enough space to move and grow.


Unfortunately, lotus will easily choke a pond, therefore the pond will probably require a filter or fountain to keep the water fresh if you have fish – ask for advice at your local aquatics supplies store.
Lotus will prefer to be away from any fast moving water caused by a fountain or filter, so keep them in a separate part of the pond.

, Fish need enough space for their size – don’t believe the old wives’ tale that fish only grow to fit the available space. It isn’t true!


The fish won’t appreciate living in a small space with a fountain pounding overhead and lotus choking up all the space.
You’ll need to confine your lotus to one area of the pond and let the fish have the rest of the space.

, You'll be using the cans of foam insulation for the next step (possibly up to 3 cans).

, Don't make too much of a pattern out of it(i.e. doing it all in even rows.) Let the foam grab and ""sink"" around the wires of the frame. Cover it completely, leaving the inside hollow. Allow to sit for 24 hours.

, The reason you use grout mix instead of concrete mix is the absence of gravel in the grout mix. How many rocks to you see in nature that have smaller stones sticking out of them?

, Swirl them around to make sure every bit is covered. As you pull the burlap strips out of the grout mix, pinch your fingers on either side of it, and run them down it to ""squeegee"" off the excess grout.

, Try not to let them wrinkle anywhere. Try to push them into as many crevices in the foam as you can. As you lay each strip down, overlap it over the previous one just little bit. Use the grout mix to smooth the edges. Cover the entire wire and foam frame with these strip until no foam is showing through. If your frame starts to bend from the weight of the grout, use something to prop up the inside of it such as a stick, to help maintain it's original height. Allow to dry for at least 24 hours. If some of the edges of the burlap are still showing, mix up a small batch of grout, thicker this time, and use your hands to smooth it on over these spots.

, You will need to paint it. You can use whatever colors you want, but use flat paint. If you use glossy paint, it will give your rock a ""plastic"" fake look.

The last step for your backyard fish pond is the water return.",How to Make a Backyard Fish Pond," Sun or shade? If you are going to have water lilies they take at least 5 hours of sun a day. The downside of placing your pond in direct sunlight it may be uncomfortable for you if you want to sit by your pond and enjoy the fish. Also, algae will flourish in direct sunlight (water lilies and a UV clarifier will help prevent this).


Avoid placing the pond in areas where water runs off after a heavy rain. Runoff can get between the pond wall and the liner and cause your liner to float up. This is especially true with liners that were not properly installed in the first place. The liner must be anchored down around entire pond edge when first installed, or you will need to remove all the water, plants, gravel, and rocks in the pond to repair it.
You also run the risk of runoff that contains traces of your neighbors weed killer getting into the pond and killing your fish.
You will need to drain water out of the pond safely and efficiently away from other structures. Many things can cause the pond to overfill, including heavy rainfall, improper pumping, or a hose running too long. Furthermore, you will need to make sure it can drain properly for cleaning and winterization.;
, If you are going to keep fish in your backyard pond it must be at least 4 feet (1.2 m) deep. Waterlilies do their best in 3 to 5 feet (0.9 to 1.5 m) of water. The deepest end of the pond is where you place the bottom drain and that should be located furthest away from the water return.


Any pond more than 1 foot (0.30 m) deep should have steps all the way around so that small animals, children and adults can easily get out if they fall in. It only takes six inches of water to drown an adult.

, As big as you have space, money, and time for. The bigger the better. The more water it will hold the more plants and fish it will support which means less effort on your part in keeping it looking good.


You will need to maintain your pond so that it does not become overgrown. Plants and fish multiply quickly. Overgrown ponds are not easily maintained, and they will become unsightly within a few years.

, Formal ponds are usually squares, rectangles, and exact circles. An informal pond is more like a natural pond where it follows the ground's natural lines and has no definite shape. Any shape you choose should allow for good water circulation. The best water flow is from rounded edges, not corners. The bottom drain should be as far away from the water return as possible to insure maximum circulation.

, Begin by marking the area where the pond will go. Find out where all your utilities lines are buried before you begin digging. It is important to have the sides of the hole level all the way around or it will be noticeably uneven once the pond is finished. The edge of the pond should have a slight rise to keep out rain run-off.


Before you begin any digging project in the US, you are legally required to call Digline at 811. They will tell you if there are any utility lines, cables, pipes, or other obstacles at your site. This service is completely free.

, You need a pump to recirculate all the water in the pond at least twice an hour. This will maintain optimal hygiene and oxygenation. Here is a guide for the size you will need. 1 1/2” for ponds up to 1,500 gallons (5,678.1 L) then graduate to 2” for ponds over 1,500 gallons (5,678.1 L). 3” and 4” must be considered for ponds over 2,500 gallons (9,463.5 L). Whenever possible use PVC. It is cheaper than flex hose and easy to install. Remember, this needs to be bought and installed before putting down your liner.


You will need to hire a professional State Licensed electrical contractor to install safe electrical connections for the pump. These will need proper maintenance as well. An improperly installed, wired and/or grounded pump can kill anything that touches the water.

, If you are planning to put fish in your backyard pond your bottom drain MUST have an anti-vortex cover, if not the fish will be sucked into the grating.


The drain must fit well. It should be permanently sealed through the pond liner and underlayment to guarantee that there are no leaks. If this fails, the entire pond will fail.

, You simply cannot build a good pond without a good liner ad an heavy underlayment to protect the liner. This is the skin of the pond and one of the most important components of your backyard pond. The object is for the liner to last 20 years. The best liner you can get to last is the 45 mil EPDM liner material.


To get the correct measurement for your liner-- Drop a piece of string 18” from the edge of the pond where the water will crest. Drop the string along the hole at the widest part, allowing it to follow the curves of the hole then mark the string 18” from the opposite edge. Now measure your string. Do this also for the length of your pond. Use underlayment under your pond liner.
Every pond liner will settle and sink down into the pond as it is filled with gravel, rocks, plants, silt, and other materials. It is important to purchase at least 1 foot (0.30 m) extra if not 18–24 inches (46–61 cm) in overall length and width for the liner. If the liner pulls under the water's edge, this pond will need to be drained and the liner, reinstalled.

,


The eduction jets create underwater currents and push the water to avoid areas of stagnation.
The skimmer is a fish safe bucket that allows the system to automatically rake fallen leaves and debris off the surface of the water.
Check the filter and filtration system at least two to three times a week, or damage to pumping\filter system can quickly occur. This will help keep it clean at all times.

,


The bead filter traps sand and debris while housing the good bacteria which is so important for the health of your pond and fish.
The UV Clarifier is to get rid of the algae blooms and it enables you to have clear water. Another way to reduce algae and keep the water clean is to use gravel and rocks in the pond.

, You have many options for your water return. You can have a gentle stream or an overflowing waterfall. The choice is yours.


If there is an electrical outage, the pond level will have to hold the extra water running through the waterfall, stream, or filtration system. This will raise the level of the water considerably.

Understand that there are only two ways to sustainably stop algae in lakes, ponds and rivers.,
Eliminate the algae.,
Understand that mechanical removal is tedious and the upkeep is more than most are ready to commit to due to the time consuming, never-ending work involved.,
Consider using bacterial treatments.,
Block the sunlight.","How to Control Lake, Pond and Lagoon Algae","


The first way is to address the problem of nutrient overload. One should ask:






Why are there too many nutrients in the water?
What can I do to reduce the nutrients entering the water?


The second way is to plant heavy feeding aquatic species.





;
, This can be a daunting task – one that entails chemical, mechanical or biological treatment, all aimed at the same end result. Chemical treatments can be effective but do have disadvantages since most all of these types of treatments are an inorganic Copper Salt--usually copper sulfate (Cutrine) or something closely related. Copper Sulfate is a heavy metal. Heavy metals are not good for people, plants, or animals. Furthermore, chemical remediation kills the current crop of algae--as the dead algae rots it provides more food for the next growth of algae.

, Biological treatments are the safest eco-friendly approaches when dealing with nuisance weeds and have been the premier choice of method among professional, state and park managers.

, Bacterial treatments are simply a super condensed version of the bacterial strains found in a pristine water body and their ability to force clarity through phosphate and nitrate reduction have made them the most popular and earth friendly approach to lake restoration and remediation. Bacteria introduced into the system quickly multiply and begin a never ending cycle of digesting the heavy sludge layers found in all lake, pond and lagoon beds. As organic material builds up in the water, nutrients, primarily Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are released into the water as the organic material decomposes. This creates Eutrophic conditions (water overloaded with nutrients) which is the perfect condition for algae growth. Algae, unlike other plants, use the water's dissolved oxygen during the night. A body of water, depleted of oxygen, cannot support any aerobic life and will soon become an anaerobic (smelly) cesspool.

, Sunlight is another fuel for algae and plenty of sunlight equates to plenty of algae (only if Eutrophic conditions exist). Modern bio remediation techniques include bacterial treatments running concurrently with water dyes (that don't usually work) designed to block out light in order to inhibit the growth of algae while supporting the bacterial degradation and nutrient depletion effects of bacterial additives. Many companies offer “blue” and “black” dyes containing mostly blue dye while more advance formulas are adding yellow based dyes to their blend which effectively block a broader spectrum of sunlight, resulting in enhanced blocking capability.

, You will need to research specific requirements for the tank size, temperature, maintenance, equipment and food needed to keep the type of fish you have healthy. Salt water and fresh water fish have different requirements.


Saltwater fish need more maintenance and are not as hardy as most freshwater fish. Their water composition must be checked regularly. You will need special equipment, such as a hydrometer to regularly measure the specific gravity of the water as well as quality salt mixes. , A low-stress environment is the best way to keep your fish healthy. When fish are stressed, their immune system is weakened so they are more susceptible to disease. Preventing stress through regular maintenance and care will go a long way to protect your fish from getting sick.


Regularly maintain the tank through partial water changes. Change about a quarter of your tank's water every other week.
Feed your fish a nutritious, varied diet. Most fish can do fine and even thrive on processed flake, stick or pellet food. Adding some variety in their diet will help add some nutrition and fiber, such as frozen or freeze-dried bloodworms, live or frozen brine shrimp and some vegetables.
Do not overfeed your fish. Feed your fish only what they will eat in 3 minutes. Not only can excess food foul the water, but it can also make your fish sick.
Check to make sure your filtration system is working effectively. Filters remove harmful toxins such as ammonia and nitrites from the water.
Give your fish enough tank room to live comfortably. Don’t overcrowd them. A good rule-of-thumb to follow is no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fish per gallon.
Put only compatible fish species together. You don’t want your fish to eat, hurt or aggressively compete with each other. Peaceful fish will be stressed if kept with aggressive fish as wll fish species that communicate differently through body language.

, Your tank’s temperature needs to match the needs of your fish. Keeping the tank too cold or warm will stress your fish. For example, goldfish prefer temps under 70 °F (21.1 °C), while most tropical fish need the water to be around 73–79 °F (23–26 °C). , Fish that have been living in an overpopulated, dirty tank will be under stress and could carry disease that might infect all your fish. Spend a little more for quality fish rather than fish that could die less than a month later.


The store's fish tanks should be clean with active, brightly colored, unstressed fish.
The store should offer return policies on fish and provide full credit on fish that die the first few days after purchase.
Sales staff should be knowledgeable about fish as well as tank set up, sizes, inhabitants, diseases, ect.
Generally, stores that specialize in aquariums and fish are best.

, Adding fish directly to your tank can stress fish and even kill them. The water in your tank and the store tank likely differ in temperature and water composition. The fish needs to gradually get used to its new environment.


Keep store water out of your tank because it can carry diseases or parasites.
If you can, quarantine new fish for 2 weeks before adding them to your tank. In this case, get the fish used to the quarantine bowl or tank’s water first—not the main tank. Watch for signs of disease and adjust the water or medicate, if needed.
Set the fish bag in your tank. After 30 minutes add ¼ cup of tank water into the bag. Do this every 15 minutes for an hour. If the bag gets too full just remove extra water. Afterward, net the fish and place it in its new tank.
For the first few weeks, watch new fish carefully for signs of stress and disease.

, Your fish will not be acting like they normally do. They may seem distressed, have no appetite, hide, have nicked fins or sores.


If your fish is near the surface gasping for breath, this means it’s probably not getting enough oxygen. This can happen due to poor water circulation, gill damage, or toxins in the water.
Fish that are always in hiding indicate that either its companions are too aggressive or the tank doesn’t have enough cover such as plants or rocks for the fish to feel safe while swimming.
Fish with nicked fins or wounds that don’t heal might be the target of aggression from other fish. Minor cuts should heal quickly. Stress may be suppressing the fish’s immune system so it can’t heal normally. Check to make sure you have followed good care and maintenance techniques and remove aggressive fish.

, Fish can get diseases such as parasites, fungus or infections. If your fish is sick, then that fish has likely been stressed for some reason. On top of treating the disease, you will need to remove the stressors to ensure the fish gets better and no others get sick.


Fish who are sick may not seem hungry or may spit out food.
Sick fish may lay at the bottom of the tank for long periods of time and seem lethargic.
Some sick fish may rub their body on tank décor to scratch themselves.
Sick fish often acquire a dull color and turn pale or gray.
The tails or fins of sick fish may be clumped, closed, stiff, or seem to be falling apart.
Sick fish will have open sores, white patches, lumps or spots on their body.
Some sick fish may have swollen or protruding eyes.
Differences in scale appearance could indicate disease, such as if scales are raised.
An abnormally swollen or hollow belly is another sign of a sick fish.

, Fish with bacterial infections can be very sick. The bacteria causing the infection can be either gram positive or gram negative but unless you consult a veterinarian you may not know which type of bacteria is the problem. Your fish may require antibiotic treatment.


Tail Rot or Fin Rot—Fins or tails appear to be getting shorter or falling apart with reddish areas that may be infected.
Dropsy—A fish with dropsy may have a bloated belly, raised scales and have a pine-cone appearance.
Popeye (Exopthalmia)—The fish may have cloudy, protruding eyes or a bubble over the eye region. One or both eyes can be affected.
Tuberculosis—Fish affected with tuberculosis may die suddenly. Symptoms can include open sores, body deformities, raised scales, fin and tail rot, and gray lesions. People can catch this deadly disease from handling infected fish. Do not handle sick fish and disinfect your hands after touching tank equipment.
Septicemia (Red Streaks)—The fish may have bloody red streaks across its body or fins. They may also have clamped fins, bloating, ulcers, gasp for air and lethargy.

, Like bacteria, fungus is naturally present in your tank. When fish are stressed or injured, the mucous layer they produce that protects them from infection becomes damaged. They are then susceptible to fungus.


Cotton Wool Disease—There may be white, yellowish-brown, or whitish-gray growth on the body, fins or mouth. These growths may look like cotton tufts and can appear on the top of the fish as well. There could be redness around infected areas, along with lethargy, loss of appetite and body rubbing.

, Fish with internal parasites may have a normal appetite but still appear to lose weight. They may also be lethargic.


Ich (Ichthyophthirius)—This condition is caused by a parasite and will show up as white dots all over the fish’s body and head that look like salt. Fins may be clamped.
Velvet—The fish may be lethargic, have clamped fins, poor appetite, loss of color, may dart about and rub its body against décor and substrate.
Body Slime Infection—A fish with this condition will be covered in a white film that can be raised in some areas, cloudy eyes and clamped fins.

, Some diseases are syndromes that can have multiple causes, such as viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic or genetic. You may need to consult the advice of a specialist to figure out what is causing the disease.


Swim Bladder Disease (SBD) or Bloat—Your fish may have trouble swimming, not be able to stay upright, or swim on his side.
Puffy Gills—This condition causes inflamed, reddish gills and gasping for breath.

, Putting your fish in a sick bowl or tank may help keep the disease from spreading. It will also make it easier to administer medications. Make sure to use tank water from the main tank to keep from stressing your fish further.

, Check for toxin buildup. Look to see if any other fish are showing signs of stress or disease. Quarantine other sick fish and try to find out why your fish are stressed.

, A fish specialist or veterinarian can help you decide on proper treatment for your fish and provide prescription medications. Though fish medications for most fish illnesses may be available at pet stores, many have not been evaluated or approved by CVM. For this reason, you may not be sure whether they contain the correct amount of drug or are safe and effective. Always read and follow medication directions. Don’t overdose your fish. Make sure your fish are not a species that is sensitive to the ingredients.
Use antibiotics sparingly. Antibiotic resistance is a real problem around the world that occurs when bacteria mutate and are no longer affected by the antibiotic treatment. Always try other treatments first and do not medicate healthy fish.
Consider euthanizing very sick fish. Sometimes treatments just do not work so be prepared this possibility.

, Often, cleaning the fish tank and keeping conditions optimum can help your fish recover from an infection. However, using a product such as API Melafix Antibacterial Fish Remedy, Maracyn, antibacterial fish food or another antibiotic may help.


Dropsy can be treated by adding no more than 2.5 teaspoons of epsom salts to the tank per 10 gallons (37.9 L) of water. This will draw some of the excess water out of the fish's body. Feed your fish antibacterial fish food for 7-10 days. Maracyn Two added to the water can also help.
Fin-rot needs to be cured quickly because it can spread to the body. Treat with warm, clean water, a few drops of garlic juice, and a product that replaces the slime coat, such as Stress Coat by API. You may need Maracyn or an antibiotic like tetracycline.Popeye can be treated similarly to other bacterial infections with Maracyn or tetracycline and antibiotic fish food. Septicemia- A combination of Maracyn, other antibiotics like Kanamycin Sulfate and antibiotic fish food is the best way to treat this., Treatment for fungal infections, such as cotton wool disease, includes salt baths using freshwater aquarium salt, an antifungal agent like phenoxyethanol or Rid Fungus. You can also try applying the anti-fungal and anti-bacterial agent, Gentian Violet. , Many organisms can make your fish sick. Formalin-based medications and copper sulfate are the most common treatments for parasite infections. However, changing certain conditions in the tank can also get rid of them.


Ich can be treated with medication that is formalin based, contains malachite green, methylene blue or copper sulfate. Body slime infection can be treated with formalin-based medication, copper sulfate or potassium permanganate. These parasites are also sensitive to salt and temperature. Raising water temperatures to 86 °F (30 °C) and adding salt at a dose of 0.4 to 0.7 ounce per gallon for 7-14 days can cure slime disease. Velvet disease can be treated by dimming the lights of the aquarium. Since velvet is caused by a protozoan that needs chlorophyll for nutrients, a lack of light starves the organism of food., You can try to treat the symptoms of syndromes with the treatments already mentioned. More frequent water changes and tank maintenance can often help clear up problems in a few days or weeks.


If your fish looks bloated, it may be constipated. To treat this, get a frozen pea. Shell it, thaw it, and cut into tiny pieces. Feed a few of these to your fish, then feed it nothing for a few days. You can also try feeding live, frozen, or freeze-dried daphne for the same results.

, Not changing the water regularly is the most common cause of illness in fish, so this is one of the most important things you can do to keep your fish healthy. Monitor the water quality and ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels by using water testing kits from your store. This will tell you how often and how much you need to change.


Never change all of your tank water at one time. This change in water chemistry will likely stress your fish. You should not change more than 1/3 of the water in any 24 hour period.
Some aquariums can do ok with changing 1/4 of the water every two weeks. However, most pet fish owners will need to do it more often. Changing 25% of your tank's water every other week helps to dilute and remove nitrates as well as replace trace elements and important buffers used up by bacteria.
You will also need to remove wastes hiding in the nooks and crannies of your aquarium. To do this, vacuum the gravel when you change the water. The exception to this is saltwater aquariums that use live substrates at the bottom.

, If your filter is not removing ammonia properly because it is clogged, your fish will get stressed and eventually die. Cleaning the filter usually involves either rinsing them in used tank water or vacuuming them.

, Tap water has chlorine or chloramine in it so it’s safe for us to drink. However, these chemicals are toxic to fish and damages their gills, causing stress and illness.


You will need to add the chemical sodium thiosulfate, available at fish stores, to the water before adding tap water to your tank. This will neutralize chlorine in the tap water.
Chloramine can be neutralized through the use of products such as Amquel. These chemicals take care of the ammonia and chlorine in the chloramine molecules.
If you don’t want to use chemicals to remove chlorine, you can leave circulating water via a filter or air-stone in a bucket or tank for 24 hours.

, Your fish will get stressed from rapid pH changes in tank water. Aim for a pH between 6.5 and 7.5. This is ideal for most fish.


Tank water tends to become acidic over time because of nitrates that build up. The pH can be raised or lowered using chemicals such as muriatic (hydrochloric) acid or phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid can raise the phosphate level in your tank and cause algae growth.
Always treat water for pH adjustments prior to adding it to the tank.
You can also bubble CO2 (carbon dioxide) through the tank via CO2 injection systems. This will lower the pH without the need for chemicals.

, Aquatic plants can help your aquarium establish its own natural eco-system, protect from early fish loss, release oxygen, keep algae at bay and purify your water. Plants can also make your tank look really cool! An aeration unit may not be required if you have healthy, aquatic plants in your tank. Aquatic plants will use up toxic ammonia and nitrites in your tank to grow. Faster growing plants like Cabomba, Ludwigia or Egeria Densa or other stem species can remove a lot of ammonia quickly., Your fish will benefit from having algae eaters control potentially harmful algae in the tank. These include shrimps, snails, and algae-eating fish."

Bloated body
Cloudy eyes
Abscesses
Open sores
Red streaks through the fish's body
Redness of the skin, fins, or organs

, Fungal infections can be associated with other types of illnesses. The symptoms of a fungal infection could include the following:


Strange swimming behavior including the tendency to dart around the tank
Small collections of whitish material growing on the fish's eyes, skin, or mouth

, If your fish has a parasitic infection, its symptoms will differ from those of bacterial or fungal infections. Some symptoms to watch for include:


A lack of appetite
A tendency to be inactive
A film or unusual mucus on the fish's body
Worms or spots that you can see on or in the fish's body
Fast breathing
Scratching

, Some other diseases might be non-infectious, such as tumors, constipation, injuries, or even congenital abnormalities. Some diseases may be viral as well. Most diseases have treatments available, and proper filtration can help prevent recurrence of diseases whether the tank is freshwater or saltwater., The hospital tank can be an inexpensive aquarium or an older unit not currently in use as a display tank. Do not use substrate (sand or gravel) or live plants. A filtration system that does not use carbon should be used in the hospital tank because carbon may negate some medicines.Artificial plants may be used to comfort diseased fish. Other types of cover where the fish can hide may be comforting as well.
The carbonless filter used should also be lower power in order to avoid disturbing the fish too much.

, The hospital tank's water must be kept at the appropriate temperature for your fish. Choose a heater that will not vary its temperature too much in order to keep the ailing fish comfortable and safe. Be sure to protect the fish from heater burns as well by blocking the heater from direct contact with the fish. This can be done with any kind of barrier to the heater, such as plastic mesh.Pet stores or aquarium specialty stores can recommend other options for heater barriers.

, An air stone in an aquarium can help replace oxygen in the water. This is particularly useful in a hospital tank because some medicines can reduce the amount of available oxygen in the water. Air stones are available anywhere aquarium supplies are sold.

, Some diseases can be inhibited by little or no light, so keeping the aquarium minimally lit and in a dark room can help treat the diseased fish. This depends, of course, on the pathogen, but if your fish's ailment is one that needs light, keeping the aquarium dimly lit and in a dark room may help fight the disease.


Check with an aquarium specialist at your pet store, aquarium specialty store, or a veterinarian to see if your fish's ailment can be inhibited via minimal lighting.

, Ensure that the hospital tank's water is as similar to the main display tank's water as possible in both temperature, water source, and regular additives, including dechlorination. Prepare two additional tanks or buckets of water of at least 2.5 gallons that are also filled with water as close to the same as the main display tank as possible. Use a net to move the fish to the first bucket., Add 3/8 of a teaspoon of salt per gallon of water to the first bucket every two minutes up to ten minutes. Move the fish to the next bucket of water and wait 15 minutes. After the 15 minutes have passed, ad another 3/8 of a teaspoon of salt per gallon of water to the second bucket. Wait another 15 minutes and move the fish to the hospital tank., Check online to help diagnose diseases. You may also want to secure the help of a veterinarian with fish experience to help diagnose. Once you have determined the type of disease the fish is stricken with, obtain the appropriate medicine.In the hospital tank, administer the medicine. Be sure to follow the instructions for the treatment you are administering.

, Keep the fish in the hospital tank for ten days during treatment. Replace 30%-50% of the water in the hospital tank each day to help keep it clean and fresh. Move the fish into a shallow bowl each day and observe—possibly with a magnifying glass—to track the progress of healing and determine at the end of the ten days whether the fish can return to the main display tank.

, To prevent the spread of the disease after the fish has been treated, be sure to sanitize all tanks. This can be achieved by the use of dilute hydrochloric acid or potassium permanganate. Both are available at aquarium specialty stores and possibly pet stores that cater to aquarists. Be sure to follow instructions for use in sanitizing fish tanks—let stand in the tank with water for two to three days, then thoroughly clean and sanitize the tank.


Refill the tank after sanitization and restart filtration system to get water back to normal for fish.

The males and females of these species mate, after which the females form eggs within their bodies. Over the course of a month or two (for most aquarium species), the eggs hatch into fish, and the mother gives birth.


Search for the name of your species online to discover whether it is egg-bearing (oviparous) or live-bearing (viviparous).;
, As a general rule, male fish of live-bearing species are brighter or more elaborately colored, and have a narrow, long anal fin on their lower side next to the tail. Females tend to be more drab, with a triangular or fan-shaped anal fin. If you can identify their sex, you'll have an easier time telling whether two fish are fighting (typically two males or two females), or whether they are mating or preparing to mate (one male and one female).


Some species are more difficult to tell apart, and may require an expert from an aquarium store.

, Different fish species can behave very differently during pair-bonding, amplexus, and other mating-related behaviors. In many species, including most gouramis, the male chases the females around energetically, sometimes even causing scrapes, bites, or other damage. In others, such as discus, a male and a female will work together to defend one area of the tank from other fish. In either case, when actual mating occurs, this may involve the male and female gripping each other, turning upside down, wriggling around each other, or more subtle activities that are difficult to see.

, The female fish will grow a bulge at the back of the abdomen. The abdomen typically grows over the course of 20–40 days, either into a large, rounded shape or a ""boxy"" shape.


Some species such as balloon mollies have a natural bulge further forward, just below the gills.
Overweight males may develop a bulge in the front chest. If you skip feedings for two or three days, an overweight bulge may shrink, while a female's pregnancy bulge will note.

, Pregnant female fish often develop a ""gravid spot"" on the abdomen near the rear vent. This is typically black or bright red, and grows more pronounced over the course of the pregnancy.


Some fish always have this spot, but it will typically grow brighter or darker during once the fish is pregnant.

, Raising young fish, or fry, can be extremely challenging, and usually requires an entire separate tank so the adults or water filter does not harm them. If you are not ready for the task, try contacting an aquarium store or an experienced aquarium hobbyist who might be willing to help you or take the fish from you. If you do decide to take care of the young, you can start with the section below on raising young, but researching your specific fish species as well is recommended.

Use this method for egg-bearing species.,
Watch for signs of nesting.,
Check for eggs.,
Prepare for the eggs to hatch.",How to Tell if Your Fish Is Having Babies2," Many aquarium fish are egg bearers, including discus fish, bettas, and most gourami species. The females of these species lay hundreds of eggs, usually in prepared nests on the floor, wall, or water surface. If there is a male in the same tank, he may fertilize the eggs after they are laid or by mating with the female beforehand, depending on the species. The eggs will eventually hatch into live fish.


Look for your species name online to find out whether it lays eggs (oviparous species), or gives live birth (viviparous).
The females of some fish species are able to store sperm for months before using it to fertilize eggs, so a new tank with females only can sometimes still reproduce.

, Some egg-laying fish create nesting areas to keep their eggs safe. These may look like small pits or gravel mounds, but they are not always visible. Some gouramis can create elaborate nests made from a mass of bubbles, usually created by the male along the water surface.

, Some females of this species bulge as eggs grow inside of them, but this is typically not a major change and doesn't last long. Once laid, the eggs often look like tiny balls of jelly. These are often scattered to the water, but in some species they end up in a mound on the nesting area, or stuck to the floor or side of the aquarium.


Many egg-laying species also have mating rituals, including most gouramis. These are often energetic displays that can last up to a few hours, ending with the eggs being deposited.

, Caring for young fish, or fry, can be difficult, but even if caught unawares you'll have some time before the eggs hatch. Consult an aquarium store if you are interested in raising the fry yourself, since the process can vary by species. If caught unawares, refer to the section on raising young fish for basic advice, but do not assume the method will work perfectly for every fish species.

"
Research your species as much as possible.,
Replace the filter with a sponge filter.,
Separate the fish.,
Feed the fish fry food.,
Plan how to care for them as adults.",How to Tell if Your Fish Is Having Babies3," The instructions below can teach you the basics, and are useful emergency steps to take if your tank is suddenly full of young fish. However, taking care of young fish, or fry, is a real challenge, and the more you know about the traits of your specific species, the better.


For more detail on a specific species, follow these guides for breeding and raising discus fish, gouramis, bettas, and ].
Ask for advice from the employees at an aquarium store, or on aquarium hobbyist forums online. This is usually more helpful than advice from a general purpose pet store.

, If you have a water filter that sucks in water or creates a current, turn it off and put in a sponge filter from an aquarium store instead. Otherwise, the current could exhaust the young fish or even suck them into the filter and kill them.

, Many fish breeders set up a completely new tank, and move the eggs or the young into it. However, if you aren't an experienced aquarium caretaker, it can be difficult to make a safe, stable water environment on short notice. Instead, you may use a plastic divider net from an aquarium store to separate the fish. Depending on species, the parents can be caretakers or predators, so try to find advice online that matches your fish. If you can't, decide how to separate based on the parental behavior:


If the parents laid eggs in a nest and defended them from other fish, use the net to divide the parents and the eggs on one side, and the other fish on the others.
If the mother had a live birth, or sprayed the eggs in the water, keep all adult fish on one side of the net. The young fish should swim through the net to hide from them.

, You can sometimes purchase a specialized ""fry food"" product from aquarium stores, but often you'll need to choose from an array of other options. Infusoria, liquid fish food, or rotifers are usually safe. However, as the fish grow, they may need additional food that can vary based on the species and size. Ask an aquarium store employee for advice based on your fish's species.


If you can't get to an aquarium store, feed the young fry hard boiled egg yolk pushed through a cheesecloth.

, Set up another tank in advance if you plan to keep some of the fish. Otherwise, contact local aquarium stores and aquarium hobbyists in advance to arrange how to sell or give away your young fish once they reach a certain age.

Clean the tank.",How to Make Your Fish Live Longer," While it might seem that a big tank would only mean more work, the opposite is the case. Small tanks get dirty quicker and thus require more regular maintenance. The larger your aquarium the better. It will keep your fish happier and save you energy.20-gallon tanks are the minimum size you should consider and will be too small for many fish. Semi-aggressive fish, for example, need additional space to prevent fights. Consult with an expert about how much space your fish requires..You might be required to assemble the aquarium. Follow the instructions on the box, because these will vary from tank to tank.
Be sure that the tank comes with a lid. Many fish like to jump and can leap out of the aquarium if you aren’t careful.
You should also have a light that you leave on for approximately 12 hours a day and leave off the other half of the day. These come standard with most, but not all, aquariums.;
, These are important for keeping the aquarium at the appropriate temperature for your fish and for cleaning waste out of the water. There are many models for filters. It is principally important that you get one that is designed to a filter a tank as large as the one that you have picked out.


You should also refrain from buying an undergravel filter if you are using a fine substrate, like sand. Certain types of fish can be hurt by gravel and require a sand substrate.
A heater is especially important if you plan to keep tropical fish, because these prefer warm water., You will need to place your aquarium on something and most household items—desks and tables included—are not strong enough to accommodate a large tank. Unless you want to have a very expensive, fishy mess on your floor, you should buy a stand specifically designed for an aquarium of your size.


Similarly, it is a very bad idea to leave the aquarium on the floor. This will all but inevitably lead an accident. Furthermore, you won’t have much fun looking at your fish if they’re on the ground.

, A tank should be placed far away from places in the house that experience significant changes in temperature. These include areas near windows, air conditioners, radiators, and air vents. Similarly, keep the aquarium away from noise. Avoid locations near doors or in busy hallways.


For your convenience, you should also pick a location is near a power plug and a water source. You probably also want sufficient space in the area to do work on the aquarium and to observe the tank., Your water utility probably treats its water with chemicals like chlorine that are harmful to your fish. Purchase some testing kits to determine if the water is safe. As an aquarium owner you should always keep on hand a sodium thiosulfate solution to treat chlorine and Amquel to treat chloramine.


For more information about the chemicals in your water supply, ask the local pet store owner or call your water utility., Gravel is a good, standard substrate to place on the bottom of your aquarium, though certain species might do best with sand. Tank decorations are also important for providing distraction for your fish, preventing conflict, and keeping your tank water well-maintained.


Decorations are important to the health of your fish. Because most of your fish are naturally prey, if they do not have places to hide, they will be stressed. Aggressive fish, on the other hand, will be more likely to fight without clearly delineated territory. Decorations, therefore, are important to keeping your fish healthy and encouraging them to be active. Somewhere from 50-75% cover will be good for most fish.
Fish will typically appreciate cover of any type, but some do have preferences. Fish from slow moving or static water will typically prefer soft, flexible cover like plants. Fish from the ocean or fast moving rivers tend to prefer large, hard objects.Place larger decorations toward the back and side of the tank. That way, the center of the tank won’t be obscured from your sight. These decorations can also be used to cover up things like wires and other accessories that make the tank look less appealing., Tap water is sufficient, though you will need to treat it. Fill the water nearly, though not all the way to the top of the tank. It is necessary to keep a layer of oxygen at the top of the aquarium.Cover the tank with a lid to prevent the fish from jumping out., You will probably want to add sodium thiosulfate and Amquel to the tank, and treat the tank for pH levels. A number of acids and bases can be purchased at the pet store to adjust the pH level in your tank.Test the level and adjust the pH until it is appropriate for your fish.


Different fish prefer slightly different pH levels, so you should familiarize yourself with species specifications. Generally, however, somewhere from 6.8 to 7.8 is healthy for your fish., After treating the water, you will want to give it sufficient time for its chemical composition to stabilize. During this period, monitor the water closely and treat if any of the readings suggest the water is inhospitable to your fish. Every couple of days do small water changes of approximately 10%.


Continue to cycle the water at a rate of approximately 10% every couple of days for the first two weeks after introducing new fish., An overcrowded aquarium can become dirty. It can also encourage confrontation between fish. Unfortunately, there is no standard for determining when a tank is overcrowded, because space demands vary considerably with each individual species. Research your fish and consult with a professional.


As a rule of thumb, a 20-gallon tank can probably accommodate three to four small fish or two medium-sized fish., Some fish require different water temperatures or substrates. Be sure that any new fish you introduce are comfortable in the same water conditions.Similarly, some fish are aggressive and will have difficulty getting along with certain types of fish.


Fish aggression is highly unpredictable. However, in general, aggressive fish are most likely to fight with other fish that look similar. That is because they will be perceived as a member of the same species and thus a rival during mating season., You do not want to keep your fish in the bag provided by the pet store for more than a couple of hours, because it will rapidly accumulate waste and become unhealthy. However, if you have the time to spare, place the bag in the water for about 15 minutes to allow the fish to acclimate to the temperature of the tank. Afterward, dump out about 20% of the water in the bag, replace it with tank water, and leave the bag in the tank for another 15 minutes. Then gently put the fish in the tank.


For more sensitive fish, you can repeat this process, replacing the water a couple of times, until the bag is predominately tank water.
This will allow your fish to become accustomed to the temperature and chemical composition of the tank.
Do not transfer any of the water from the bag into the aquarium. The water is dirty and will be unhealthy for your fish., It will take some time for your aquarium filter to adjust to the stress placed on it by the new fish.For the first two weeks after you introduce new fish, do regular checks of the water and cycle in new water at a rate of about 10% every couple of days. , How much and what you feed your fish will vary considerably from species to species. However, you should try to get your fish accustomed to being feed at specific times during the day. You have overfed your fish if, after five minutes, any food remains in the aquarium. Refrain from overfeeding because excess food will cause the aquarium to quickly become dirty. , Remove excess food daily and use a scrapper to clean algae off from the side of the tank. Be sure to clean the bottom of the tank with a siphon to remove waste and other unsanitary leftovers. There are a variety of specialized tools available at pet stores for performing these cleanings., Check the water frequently for pH levels and other chemical imbalances. Keep chemical treatments on hand in case the water needs to be treated.

, Once every couple of weeks, you should remove and replace 10-15% of the water. Do not remove fish when changing the water. This will cause unnecessary stress. Treat new water before adding it to the tank. Use a siphon to slowly introduce the new water back into the tank.When replacing the water, put new water into a bucket that is not used for any other household tasks (cleaning products will introduce dangerous chemicals). Use this bucket as a space to test and treat the water as discussed previously. After it is treated, introduce the water into the tank.

, It is particularly important to watch for signs of illness with fish. That is because many fish diseases are highly communicable. Take precautions if you notice:


Rubbing against objects in tank
Duller coloration, changes in color pattern, and spotting
Chewing on gills and fins
Lethargy
Holding fins tight against the body
Bloating
Gasping for air at the surface of the water
Disappearance of mass in the fins or tail, To prevent the spread of disease, it is useful to keep a smaller tank that sick fish can be quarantined in. Keep the fish quarantined until you have diagnosed and treated the disease.

, Most fish diseases can be treated with commercially produced anti-biotic and anti-fungal solutions. If you have been unable to determine the cause of the illness. Talk to the people at the pet store. They should be happy to offer recommendations., To prevent further spread of illness, do everything you can to ensure that tank conditions are healthy. Clean out waste and food, check the pH, and cycle water.

Try to scoop the fish into your aquarium net.,
Look for breathing.,
Check the fish's eyes.,
Examine the fish's scales.",How to Tell if Your Fish Is Dead1," Look for signs of struggle as you place the net around the fish's body. If your fish is just sleeping, they'll wake up and try to wiggle their way out of the net. If they don't, they could be dead or very sick.
, Check the gills for most species. If they're not moving, the fish isn't breathing. Bettas and other labyrinth fish breathe through their mouths. If your fish is from this family, watch their bodies for up and down movements., Look at the eye as a whole. If they're sunken, your fish is dead or near death. Look for cloudy pupils, which is also a sign of death in most aquarium fish.If your fish is a pufferfish, walleye, rabbitfish, or scorpionfish, occasional eye cloudiness might actually be normal. However, you should contact your vet if the cloudiness persists for several days., Do this if your fish has jumped out of the tank. Look for cracking of the skin as you pick up the body. Feel the body to see if it has dried out. These signs are only present in dead fish."
"
Spend time with your dying fish.,
Euthanize a suffering fish.,
Remove any dead fish from the tank, if you can.,
Don't flush the fish down the toilet.",How to Tell if Your Fish Is Dead2," Look for symptoms such as an inability to eat or sinking immediately after swimming to the top of the tank. This will be difficult to watch, but you should treat your fish like any other companion animal. Sit by the aquarium. Talk to your fish, if that's what you usually do., Clove oil is a sedative and is the most humane way to end the suffering of a dying fish. You can buy it in most drug stores. Place only the dying fish in 1 litre (0.26 US gal) of water. Add 400 mg of clove oil to the water. Within 10 minutes, the fish will lose oxygen and die peacefully., Use an aquarium net to scoop out the dead fish. If you can't find the body, don't worry. The body itself won't harm the other fish and will decompose naturally.

Fish parasites and diseases require living hosts. If you think your fish died of a disease, their tankmates might already be infected. Monitor them for symptoms. If they don't look sick or develop symptoms after a few days, they were strong enough to fight off the disease., A dead fish flushed into a non-native habitat could harm native marine life. Dispose of a dead fish in the garbage or bury them outside. If the fish is large, burial is usually best. Check your local laws to make sure they'll allow you to bury a pet fish."
"
Treat constipation with deshelled peas.,
Cut back on the feedings, if necessary.,
Research how your fish sleeps.,
Condition the aquarium water.,
Check the water temperature.",How to Tell if Your Fish Is Dead3," Constipation causes fish to float on their sides. Deshelled peas (any variety) contain enough fiber to make them regular again. If your fish hasn't had a bowel movement in the past few days, feed them two to three fresh peas or thawed frozen peas each day. Mash them or let the chunks float to the bottom of the aquarium.Avoid canned peas, as they contain sodium and spices that can hurt your fish.
Soften the peas. You can do this by boiling them on the stovetop in filtered water for one minute. Allow them to cool down after you remove them from the pan. Don't use a microwave, since this can destroy vital nutrients.
Remove the skin by peeling it off with your fingers. Make sure you wash your hands first!
Cut the peas into small pieces. First, cut them into halves if they didn't split naturally when you peeled them. Then, cut them into quarters. If your fish is small, cut the pieces even smaller.

, If your fish isn't constipated, they might have eaten too much. Overeating can cause a fish's stomach to bloat and force them to float on their sides. If your fish has had a recent bowel movement, don't feed them for three to four days., When fish sleep, they stop moving. For example, goldfish sleep by “lying down” on the bottom of the tank. Sometimes their colors fade, especially when you turn the aquarium lights out. Search online and read books about caring for fish to learn about your fish's sleeping habits.Search for this information on veterinary websites or at your local vet's office. Visit your public library or pet store for informative books. If you have access to scholarly databases, search for articles in veterinary journals.

, Chlorine, chloramine, and heavy metals in tap water can sicken and kill fish. Add water conditioner to the aquarium, following the instructions on the packaging. You can buy water conditioner at your local pet store.Test your tank water for chlorine, chloramine, and heavy metal before adding conditioner. You can buy testing kits at your local pet store. Follow the instructions on the package to avoid false positives or negatives.

, If you recently changed the water, any sudden change in temperature could send your fish into shock. Measure the temperature with an aquarium thermometer. If the temperature is below 76–80 °F (24–27 °C), turn up the thermostat on the aquarium heater. Decrease the heat if the temperature goes above this range. The shock should wear off soon after the water returns to its normal temperature."

Allow for plenty of space.,
Go with either cold water or warm water fish.,
Choose fish with similar pH level requirements.,
Go with either freshwater or saltwater fish.,
Provide plenty of hiding spots.,
Select colorful, active fish for an eye-catching tank.,
Take your experience level into account.",How to Know Which Fish to Put Together in a Tank1," It is important that you avoid overstocking your tank. The general rule is that you should have room for one gallon of water for each inch of fish in your tank. So, a ten-gallon tank can safely accommodate ten one-inch-long fish. This is a very important rule to keep in mind if you are looking to care for schools of fish.Overstocking your tank can lead to a build-up of toxic waste products. It will also necessitate additional cleanings.Some larger species, such as full-grown goldfish, will require additional tank space. Fish that move around a great deal may also need extra room.;
, You need to choose fish that all thrive at right around the same temperature. You can accommodate only a few degrees’ difference in preferred temperatures or your fish will suffer. So, a tropical fish generally cannot live comfortably alongside a cold water fish. Your tank equipment needs will also differ greatly as some fish require heaters and lights and others do not.For example, a white cloud minnow is a type of cold water fish that requires consistent temperatures between 72-82 degrees Fahrenheit (22-28 degrees Celsius) in order to thrive. Discus, on the other hand, need a warmer tank that stays in the low to mid 80s Fahrenheit (high 20s Celsius).If your tank is the wrong temperature, your fish may become more susceptible to disease. They may also move more slowly and refuse to eat.

, Make sure that the fish that you buy fall into the same range on the pH spectrum. Many fish that you buy directly from the store are acclimated to a neutral pH, but will do even better in a pH customized to them. For example, a tropical African cichlid does best in alkaline water. Most freshwater fish prefer a pH somewhere between 6.5 and 7.5.Don’t forget to take into account the pH needs of any live plants that you will add into your tank as well. For example, many fresh water plants require a pH between 6.0 and 7.5, a fairly wide range that can overlap with the needs of a number of fish., The tank filtration needs between these two fish groups are generally different, with tropical fish requiring less in the way of filtration and cleaning. The temperature and pH requirements between them are also dissimilar, which really can’t be worked around, even by a skilled aquarist.


For example, a goldfish would not live well alongside a cichlid. The goldfish requires colder temperatures and freshwater. In contrast, the cichlid thrives in tropical, saltwater conditions.

, Even if you are pretty sure that the fish will get along, it is a good idea to create an interesting tank environment that can provide some “alone” space for an individual fish. Some fish are generally social and friendly, but also need to get away every now and then. This will also minimize any stress associated with overcrowding.For example, gouramis are fish that love to hide. They establish a dominance system and, during these contests, the weaker fish will often hide from the stronger one.

, Some fishes, like the goldfish, will provide a great deal of color and activity. Other fish, such as the shark fish, are less colorful but demonstrate very interesting schooling behaviors. Some fish are bottom-feeders and prefer to hide-out during the daytime, such as the kuhli loach, making them almost impossible to spot., Make sure to consider how comfortable you are caring for fish. If this is your first tank, you may want to go with a relatively simply combination of just one or two low-maintenance types of fish. Single-species tanks are especially good for fish that prefer to swim in schools.


Oscars are dominant, large fish that don’t generally tolerate other species tank mates well. They will try to eat smaller fish especially. Puffer fishes are good options for experienced aquarists, but they also prefer to be around their own species. Platies and GloFish, for example, are great beginner fish that enjoy living in community tanks."

Change the water regularly.,
Clean your fish tank every 1-2 weeks.,
Keep the tank water warm.,
Keep the tank water slightly acidic.,
Purchase a dH kit to determine water hardness.,
Carefully introduce new fish to the fish tank.",How to Prevent and Treat Popeye in Betta Fish1," The most common cause of popeye is dirty water, and the best form of prevention is frequently replacing the dirty tank water with fresh water. Always have clean water in the betta’s fish tank or bowl to ensure that it won’t get popeye.


If your betta is kept in a bowl or tank that holds two gallons of water or less, do a 50% water change every week.
If your betta is kept in a larger aquarium, change 10-25% of the total water every 2-4 weeks.;
, Clean the tank every week if you don’t have a filter and every two weeks if you do.


Gently remove your betta fish with a net and place it into a separate clean bowl of water.
Dump out all of the water in the fish tank, remove all rocks and decorations, and rinse them with clean water.
Using a paper towel, scrub the inside walls of the tank.
Put the rocks and decorations back in the tank and fill the tank most of the way with bottled drinking water or pretreated tap water before putting your betta fish back in., The natural habitat for betta fish is warm, stagnant water. Make sure the water is kept between 76 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (24.4-27.7 degrees Celsius) in order to provide a healthy environment for your fish., Use paper pH test strips to test how basic or acidic your betta’s water is. The pH should be kept at 6.5 or 7.If the pH is too high, filter water through peat moss before putting it in the tank.
If the pH is too low, add baking soda or shells to the tank., Bettas prefer soft water, so keep the dH at 25 or lower.Go to a pet store to get specialized products that can extract the magnesium and calcium from your water if it is too hard., Different fish require different environments, so make sure that you don’t add any fish to your tank that have conflicting environmental needs. Popeye often occurs when the tank water is not kept at the proper levels, and adding a new fish that thrives in a different kind of ecosystem might throw off those levels.

Use a stress coat water conditioner.",How to Revive a Goldfish," Before you attempt to revive your goldfish, you should check for signs that he is still alive and can be saved. Signs your goldfish is dead include:He appears dried out and his skin is cracked.
His eyes are concave (bulging inward) instead of convex (bulging outward).
He has gray pupils.
He is missing body parts, like a fin or a tail.
If your goldfish displays any of these symptoms, you may need to euthanize your fish using a humane treatment like clove oil. However, if your fish looks dried out but he does not have any missing body parts or concave eyes, you may still be able to revive him.;
, The cool water contains oxygen and will help to revive your fish.Some experts also suggest placing your goldfish right back into the water in his tank, even if he appears dried out., Hold the fish in your hand, in the tank water, and use your free hand to gently remove any dirt on the sides of the fish. You can also simply move the fish around very slowly in the water to remove any debris.

, This requires a steady and patient hand. You will need to open the gill coverings on either side of the fish to check that his gills appear red, which is a good sign.You can also try giving your fish’s underbelly a massage to stimulate air flow., Most aquariums have an air stone, which helps to regulate the water temperature in the tank and to aerate the water.If you have an air stone or an air bubbler, use your hand to move your goldfish close to the air source. This will help to give your fish more oxygen and hopefully revive your fish.If you do not have access to an air stone, you can continue to massage the fish’s underbelly in the tank water until he starts to revive, or go purchase an air stone for the fish., Some goldfish owners will do a more extensive revival procedure that uses clean de-chlorinated water, a pure oxygen container, and an air pipe. This can be done if your fish is still alive, but appears lethargic and slow moving. To perform serious CPR on your fish, go to your local hardware store and get the following materials:


An air stone.
An air pipe.
A pure oxygen container.
A large plastic container, big enough for your fish.
Plastic cling wrap.
Adhesive tape.
You will also need access to clean, de-chlorinated water.

, De-chlorinated water does not contain chlorine or chloramine, and will prevent the build up of ammonia in your fish, which could lead to illness and death. Use enough de-chlorinated water to fill the container half way.


To de-chlorinate water, you will need to add a chemical additive called dechlorinator into the tap water. You can buy dechlorinator for under $10 at your local pet store. Follow the instructions on the label to determine how many drops of dechlorinator you will need to add to a certain amount of water., You will then need to connect the air stone to the oxygen container so it can pump pure oxygen into the water. Once it is connected, place the air stone into the container and make sure it sits at the bottom of the container, in the water., Avoid over oxygenating the water by pumping too much oxygen into the air stone. There should be a steady stream of small air bubbles coming out of the air stone.During the first five minutes, the air should come out strong and steady into the water.
After five minutes, turn the oxygen valve down so the air comes out softer and not as strong, but still steady.

, Take a large piece of cling wrap and place it over the container. Fold over the sides so the container is sealed and the fish is submerged in the oxygenated water.You can seal the cling wrap further using a strip of adhesive tape.

, Be sure to check up on your fish periodically to ensure he is getting a steady oxygen flow from the air stone.After two hours, your fish should start to breathe and swim around normally.

, Though goldfish are freshwater fish, a salt bath can be great for your fish’s overall health and help him recover from a lack of oxygen. However, if your fish is already on other medications or if you are using other treatments to revive him, you should only do a salt bath before giving him other medications or after you have completed other medications or treatments.Sea salt, kosher salt, aquarium salt and pure Morton’s rock salt are all recommended for use. If possible, use natural sea salt with no additives, as it is high in minerals.
Use a container that is clean and free of any contaminants. Add tank water to the container, as long as the tank water is safe to use, or add fresh water that has been de-chlorinated. Ensure the water temperature in the container is the same as the temperature of the water in the tank, or within three degrees of the same temperature.
Add one teaspoon of salt per gallon of water. Mix the salt into the water to ensure all the granules have dissolved and then place your fish in the container of salt water.
Keep your fish in the salt water for one to three minutes, and observe your fish during the salt bath. If your fish displays any signs of stress, like rapid swimming or jerky movements, move your fish back into his main tank.

, Garlic is a natural detoxifier, and can help to purify your fish. Make your own garlic water by peeling a medium size garlic bulb and mincing it up. Then, place the minced garlic in hot water and let it sit at room temperature for up to 12 hours. You can then mash up the cloves and strain it to create garlic water. The garlic water can be kept in the fridge and is good for up to two weeks.Use the garlic water the same way you would use salt in a salt bath. Use about 1 teaspoon garlic water per 10 gallons (37.9 L) of tank water. Then, give your fish a purifying garlic bath for one to three minutes.
You can also give your fish garlic water to help prevent infection. Apply it to your fish’s mouth using a syringe or an eye dropper, two drops a day for 7-10 days.

, Chlorophyll is considered medicine for goldfish and can help boost your fish’s immune system and health. Look for pure liquid chlorophyll at your local pet store. It usually comes in drops.Give your goldfish a chlorophyll bath in his tank, following the instructions on the bottle. You can also give your goldfish chlorophyll by adding it to his gel food.

, You can purchase this product at your local pet store. Most stress coat water conditioners are made with aloe, which helps to sooth stressed out fish and heal any damaged tissue on your fish. Using a stress coat water treatment can help your fish recover after being revived."

Plan for transporting your fish.,
Change the water for a few days before moving.,
Avoid feeding your fish for one to two days before moving.,
Wait until the last possible moment to pack the fish.,
Avoid unnecessary travel with your fish.",How to Transport Fish1," Unlike some pets, you can’t just put a fish tank or fish bowl in the car and go. Instead, you need to figure out how you will transport them. Most fish can survive for around 48 hours of travel, but beyond that you increase the risk that they will not survive.When you stop for the night, you need to take the fish with you. Don’t leave them unattended in cars or trailers.
If you need to fly with your fish, contact the airline to find out what requirements they have for transporting fish.;
, Some of the water in your aquarium should be changed prior to moving and transporting the aquarium. This helps ensure that the water in the tank is clean. Switch out 20 percent of the water in the aquarium daily for five days prior to transporting the aquarium., When you are travelling, you don’t want your fish to mess up the water more than they have to. Fish can go around a week without food, so they will be find during your move. Don’t give them food for 24 to 48 hours prior to transporting them., You shouldn’t pack the fish until you are ready to go. They shouldn’t be packed and waiting to be transported. You want to take as little time as possible to transport your fish.You should also plan to unpack your fish as soon as you reach your destination. They should be the first thing you unpack.

, Fish are not pets that are easily transported. You shouldn’t take them on vacation with you or carry them around in a vehicle for fun. Fish are very fragile, which means you should only transport them when it is absolutely necessary, like when you are moving."
"
Filter or treat the tank water.,
Maintain the water correct temperature for your fish.,
Make the bowl or aquarium fish-friendly.,
Do a 10-15% water change once a week.,
Give your fish small, frequent meals.,
Treat your fish to a salt bath.,
Add chlorophyll to the tank.,
Note if there are any whitish-green threads on your fish’s skin.,
Look for a layer of mucus covering your fish’s gills and body, or chewed on gills or fins.,
Check if your fish has any protruding scales or looks bloated.,
Note if your fish is covered in white specks or spots that look like salt or sand.,
Check if your fish’s tail or fins are fraying or appear faded.",How to Keep Your Fish from Dying," To keep your fish healthy in his environment, you need to keep the tank or bowl water clean and toxin free. Fish release more waste than other fish or plants can use up, and this waste can lead to toxic or harmful chemical build up in the tank if it is not filtered or removed.


If your fish lives in a bowl, you will need to treat the tap water you use in the bowl so it is safe for your fish to live in. Treat tap water with chlorine neutralizer and a pinch of aquarium salt or rock salt before you put it in the fishbowl. The salt will help to kill bacteria in the water and keep the water clean for your fish. Do not use iodized salt, as this can harm your fish.
If your fish lives in an aquarium, you will need to install a filtration system in the aquarium to maintain clean water for your fish. Before you get any fish for your aquarium, you should dechlorinate the tank water and install a filtration system. You will need to allow the tank time to cycle through the water several times, and only introduce a few fish at a time in the environment so the filtration system is not overloaded with waste to process. This will help you avoid “new tank syndrome”, which can kill your fish.;
, If your fish is kept in water that is too warm or too cold, this could lead to high levels of stress in your fish and repress his immune system. This could then leave your fish susceptible to infection and disease. The required water temperature will depend on the fish type. If you have a tropical fish, your water temperature should be around 75 degree Fahrenheit. Tropical fish are able to tolerate water temperature fluctuations, to an extent. A goldfish, on the other hand, can tolerate water temperatures between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit. The key is to avoid rapid dramatic changes in water temperature and to maintain a water temperature that is comfortable for your fish.


Different species of tropical fish can require different temperatures so always check to make sure you are providing the correct environment.
When you buy your fish, the retailer should recommend a reliable aquarium heater to keep the water temperature constant. You can also get a thermometer to confirm the temperature of the tank or bowl water. You should wait a few days after setting up your aquarium to introduce any fish into the tank to allow the water temperature to stabilize. Check with the retailer to make sure the tank or bowl you buy for your fish is big enough as a living environment that is too small for your fish can be dangerous for your fish.
If your fish is finding the water temperature too hot, he may display certain symptoms, like darting around frantically or acting hyperactive when it is not feeding time. If your fish appears to move very slowly, seems to shiver, or loses interest in food, the water may be too cold for him. You may need to adjust the water temperature so it is closer to the ideal temperature for your fish type.

, Adding decorations to your fish’s bowl or tank can help to reduce his stress levels and give him a happy environment to swim around in.


Add a plant, live or plastic, to your fish’s bowl. This will give your fish a hiding place, which he will appreciate. If you add a live plant, watch for rotting leaves. You will need to remove or cut these leaves so they do not pollute the water. You can also add rocks and broken clay pots to give your fish more hiding places and make him feel more secure.

, This will help to remove any waste buildup and any decaying organic matter from excess food and dead leaves or roots from plants. Doing a small partial water change weekly will also clean any toxins from the water and keep the water clean.Do not remove any of the aquarium plants or decorations from the tank or bowl. Removing or cleaning these items can kill the good bacteria that has been filtering through your tank and reduce the quality of your filtration system. As well, you do not need to remove your fish from the tank or bowl when you do a partial water change. This can stress out your fish and could expose him to harmful bacteria.To do a partial water change, remove 10-15% of the water and replace it with fresh, dechlorinated tap water. You can use a siphon to suck up any gunk in the gravel and decorations. Clean 25-33% of the gravel and decorations with the siphon. You should also use an algae scraper to remove algae on the surface of the tank or the tank ornaments before you remove any of the water.If your fish tank is under ten gallons, you will need to perform a 50-100% water change at least twice a week, or every other day. If your fishbowl does not have a filter, you should do a 100% water change at least once a day to remove any waste or toxins from the water. Getting a top cover for the bowl or a filter can reduce the water changes you will need to do on a daily basis and protect your fish from getting an infection or a disease.Check the water once a day to ensure it is not cloudy, foamy, or has an unusual odor. These could all be signs of a bacterial infestation and may require a full water change.

, Your fish is used to eating small, frequent meals in nature. Mimic this by giving him small meals throughout the day rather than one big feeding session. Small feedings are also easier on your tank’s filtration system.


Most manufactured fish foods are formulated to provide your fish with all his nutritional requirements. Ask a service person at your local pet store for recommended fish foods for your fish, based on his breed.

, A salt bath can be great for your fish’s overall health. However, if your fish is already on other medications, you should only do a salt bath before giving him other medications.Sea salt, kosher salt, aquarium salt and pure Morton’s rock salt are all recommended for use. If possible, use natural sea salt with no additives, as it is high in minerals.
Use a container that is clean and free of any contaminants. Add tank water to the container, as long as the tank water is safe to use, or add fresh water that has been de-chlorinated. Ensure the water temperature in the container is the same as the temperature of the water in the tank, or within three degrees of the same temperature.
Add one teaspoon of salt per gallon of water. Mix the salt into the water to ensure all the granules have dissolved and then place your fish in the container of salt water.
Keep your fish in the salt water for one to three minutes, and observe your fish during the salt bath. If your fish displays any signs of stress, like rapid swimming or jerky movements, move your fish back into his main tank.

, Chlorophyll is considered medicine for goldfish and can help boost your fish’s immune system and health. Look for pure liquid chlorophyll at your local pet store. It usually comes in drops.Give your goldfish a chlorophyll bath in his tank, following the instructions on the bottle. You can also give your goldfish chlorophyll by adding it to his gel food.

, This is a symptom of anchor worms, which are small crustaceans that burrow into your fish’s skin and enter his muscles. They then release eggs in your fish before they die, leaving behind damage in your fish that can become infected.Your fish may also scratch against objects to try to remove the anchor worms, and the points where the anchor worms are attached to your fish may be swollen.
To treat anchor worms, you will need to remove the parasite from your fish and clean the wound with an antiseptic, such as iodine. A seawater bath five minutes a day can also force the parasite to fall off.

, These could be symptoms of body flukes, which are 1mm long flatworms. Flukes develop due to undesirable environmental conditions, such as poor water quality, overcrowding, or stress. These flatworms are often present in aquariums but remain harmless unless stressful conditions cause an outbreak to occur.Your fish may also scratch against objects to try to remove the flukes, have reddened skin, or drooping fins. His gills may also move rapidly and he may have a hollow belly.
You can treat flukes with a professional parasite guard. Always follow the directions on the package. You can also treat any secondary infections due to flukes with antibiotics or an anti fungus solution.

, These are symptoms of dropsy, which is a bacterial infection in your fish’s kidneys. It can cause renal failure and fluid accumulation, or bloating. It often occurs in fish that are weakened due to poor water conditions.To treat dropsy, you may need to use antibiotics or medicated feed from a veterinarian. You should also practice preventative care by doing regular water changes, maintaining ideal aquarium temperatures and adding aquarium salt to the water.

, This is a sign of fish ick or ich. The spots may be slightly raised and your fish will likely scratch against objects in the tank due to irritated and itchy skin. Your fish may also have respiratory issues and appear to gasp at the surface of the tank water. Ick attacks fish that are stressed due to irregular water temperature and pH fluctuations in the water.To treat or cure ich in goldfish, you can use medicated ick guard, which can be found at your local pet store. You can also prevent the develop of ick by maintaining a consistent water temperature, cleaning the tank weekly, and adding aquarium salt to the tank.

, These are all signs of a bacterial infection that causes your fish’s fins, tail and mouth to rot. Rot typically occurs in fish who are bullied by other fish in the tank or who are injured by a fin nipping tank mate. A poor tank environment can also contribute to the development of rot.Treat rot by testing the water quality in the aquarium and completing a partial water change. You can apply a multipurpose treatment to help any clamped or damaged fins heal. Adding one tablespoon of aquarium salt per a gallon to the tank can also prevent rotting in your fish.

Choose fish with similar eating patterns.,
Stock your tank with similar size fish.,
Choose fish with similar paces of movement.,
Get a school of fish.,
Buy fish that are not predatory based on sex.",How to Know Which Fish to Put Together in a Tank2," Some fish will eat anything and everything in sight, including other fish. Some fish are more picky eaters that will refuse to eat if bullied by others. Some fish require a certain number of pellets, whereas others just need a pinch of flakes. Get to know what the nutritional requirements are for your fish.


Make sure to consider the algae needs of your fish as well. Some fish, like plecos, are friendly algae eaters unless that food is not available. Then, they can turn more aggressive., General wisdom suggests that big fish will usually bully and eat little fish. Try to pair fish together that can grow alongside one another to a similar size at maturity. Angelfish, for example, are known to stalk and kill smaller fish in their tanks. A medium size fish or a schooling fish can sometimes withstand the pressures from larger fish., You don’t want to look into your tank and see fast-moving fish chasing fish that move a bit more slowly. Learn about how much movement a certain fish species prefers. Try not to pair an overly athletic fish with aggressive tendencies with a fish that is smaller, slower, and more docile., Some fish just do better when living and playing in groups. Tropical fish, unlike their freshwater counterparts, seem to particularly prefer living in schools. Try to establish a school of at least five fish, but be aware that you may need to boost your numbers even more. Tiger barbs, for example, are known to develop a temper unless they are placed with an extremely large school of 20 to 50 fish., Try to find out if the fish that you are interested in do best with those of the same sex or the opposite. This especially important information to consider with regard to spawning behaviors. For example, a male Betta fish really needs to be the only male in residence in a tank. Whereas, a female Betta does fine with other females."
"
Look out for signs of fish stress.,
Pay particular attention during fish spawning periods.,
Recognize the unique challenges presented by “bully” species.",How to Know Which Fish to Put Together in a Tank3," Fish will show that they are not doing well through their behaviors and physical appearance. They may start to look overly pale, losing their usual markings. They may start to show signs of injury, such as damaged fins. They may also refuse to eat or leave a hide-out space., When your fish begin to spawn, this is a time of high stress for all of their tank mates. Fish will pair up and can injure themselves in the mating process. Fish will also be left out from pairings and can behave aggressively as a result. It is often a good idea to move mating pairs into another tank.Also, be aware of what will happen to the offspring created. Livebearers may create babies that other fish in the tank will try to eat, if adequate hiding spaces are not provided., Fish keepers have labeled certain species “aggressive” or “semi-aggressive” because those types have a tendency to exhibit bullying behaviors in community tanks. If you choose to buy a known “bully” species, such as a red-tailed shark or cichlid, you’ll need to keep an extra close eye on your tank.You may also need to remove the bully fish and place it in an alternative tank. So, have an extra tank and materials on-hand.

Isolate the betta fish.,
Put epsom salts in the fish tank.,
Add an antibiotic to the betta fish’s water.,
Return your betta fish to its original tank after the swelling subsides.",How to Prevent and Treat Popeye in Betta Fish2," You should remove any hazardous decorations or aggressive fish from your betta’s environment. Your fish’s vision is most likely impaired, which means that the likelihood of running into sharp objects inside the aquarium or getting even more injured by other fish is higher. Avoid this easily by putting your fish in its own separate tank temporarily., Epsom salt, or magnesium sulfate, does a good job of removing the fluid that’s built up behind your betta fish’s eye. Every three days, add one tablespoon for every 5 gallons (18.9 L) of water that your fish is in., There are several different antibiotics that when added to the betta fish’s water, will make the popeye subside. Typically, you can purchase these antibiotics at pet stores.


Put ampicillin in the fish tank and switch out the water every third day. Administer the medicine until a week after your fish’s popeye has gone away.If you catch the popeye early enough, you can use erythromycin, minocycline, trimethoprim, or sulfadimidine, which are all antibiotics typically used to treat fin rot., It can take anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple months for the swelling to go down, and even longer for cornea damage to improve. Reintroduce your betta to its original environment a couple of weeks after its eyes look their normal size.


In more severe cases, one of the betta’s eyes might decay and fall off during the healing process. If this happens, keep your betta isolated permanently."

Place your fish in plastic bags.,
Transport the fish in five-gallon buckets.,
Put the fish in a container.,
Transport the aquarium if it is small.,
Transport your fish in an insulated, secure container.,
Choose a container large enough for your fish.,
Place all plants in plastic bags.",How to Transport Fish2," One way to transport your fish is to put them in plastic bags. You can get plastic fish bags from a pet store. Fill the bag a third of the way full with water from the aquarium. Then, place one fish into each plastic bag. Don’t put multiple fish in the same bag.Place a second bag over the first bag so that it is extra protected. This helps in case the bag leaks.
Use a rubber band to secure the bags so the fish and water cannot get out.
If you are going to have the fish in bags for longer than an hour, get some pure oxygen from your local pet store to place in the bags with them.

, A five-gallon bucket can be an easy way to transport multiple fish in the same container. Make sure you buy a new bucket and don’t use one that has had chemicals inside them. The bucket may have residual chemicals, which may kill or harm your fish. Make sure to cover the bucket with a water tight lid.Fill the bucket with water from your tank.

, Another way you can transport your fish is in a sturdy container that has a lid. Fill the container with water from the tank. Make sure the lid is secure so your fish doesn’t fall out and water doesn’t leak out.This may be good for fish with sharp fins or who may get out of a plastic bag.

, Small tanks can be moved with the fish and water in it. Large tanks should never be moved as a unit. If you move the aquarium with water and fish, make sure to remove all other objects. Take out all rocks, decorations, and filters. These may come loose and hurt your fish. You should also remove some of the water. This helps reduce the risk of spillage, along with giving your fish less room to be bounced around.However, even small tanks can be difficult to move. They are very heavy, but also fragile. If you drop the tank and it breaks, you may lose all of your fish.
Tanks that are moved with water in them are more likely to get chipped or cracked.

, If you have placed your fish in a bag or small containers, you should pack them in a secure carrier. Place bubble wrap between the fish bag and the container or other fish bags. Make sure they are sturdy so they don’t roll around. This can cause damage to your fish.If you have an insulated container, consider transporting your fish in it. A picnic cooler or styrofoam cooler will be great for this.

, No matter which container you choose for your fish, you should choose one large enough for them to swim around in. They don’t need a ton of room, but they should be comfortable. You should also make sure the container is large enough that the water has enough oxygen for the fish.You should only fill the container around a third of the way full. The rest of the container should be open for oxygen.

, If you have live plants in your aquarium, you should put them in plastic bags filled with water from the tank. This will keep the conditions close to what they are in the tank, and help keep good, essential bacteria alive on the plants."
"
Fill the containers with water from the top of the tank.,
Avoid placing items in the container with your fish.,
Regulate the temperature.,
Place your fish in a dark place.,
Avoid feeding your fish during travel.,
Reintroduce the fish to the tank when you arrive.",How to Transport Fish3," You need to place your fish in water from the tank, not from the tap. Fill your transport container with water from the top of the tank. This water is the cleanest. If you take water from the bottom, you will be placing waste into the small container and potential exposing them to bacteria that has settled at the bottom., You shouldn’t add your fish’s favorite rock or plant into the bucket or container with them. The fish should be the only thing in the bucket, except the water from your tank. Any extra items may move around and harm your fish., Fish need to stay at their normal water temperature. Any fluctuations in water temperature can cause your fish to get sick. Try to keep your fish’s water the same temperature of their normal aquarium. This means you should transport them in the part of your vehicle where you can use the air conditioner or heater.You can also use insulation to the transportation container. This can help regulate the temperature.
Check the fish’s temperature to make sure it doesn’t get too hot or too cold.

, Transporting the fish in a darker state can help keep them from getting too stressful. Fish are active and awake during the day when it is bright outside. At night, they are less active. Place something over the fish if they are in a container where they can get light during the day.For example, you may place a sheet or rug over the container.

, Travel is very stressful for your fish, so you don’t want to do anything to cause more stress. Don’t worry about opening bags or containers to feed your fish. This also helps reduce the need for elimination, which can make the water it is traveling in dirty., If you transported fish in bucket, you can pour them and the water directly into the tank. You may also want to use a net to move them from the bucket to the tank.If you transported your fish in bags, place the bags on top of the water and let them float. This helps regulate the temperature of the water in the bags. When the temperature of the water in both are similar, you can pour the fish into the tank.

"
"
Empty the tank water into a fish-safe container.,
Place decorations in tank water.,
Pack your filter media properly.,
Put your aquarium back together.",How to Transport Fish4," After you have secured the fish and the plants, place 80 percent of the tank water into a fish-safe bucket or bags. This water should be gotten from the top of the tank, not near the bottom. This limits the amount of waste you take with you., If you have rocks and other decorations in your tank, place them in a bag filled with water from the tank. This will preserve the beneficial bacteria that has grown on the ornaments.Don't transport these things in the tank. The tank could crack if it is moved with items inside it.

, The way you transport your filter media depends on how far you will be going. For short moves where the tank will not be separated for long, place the filter media in a clean, chemical-free, sealed container. Don’t clean it.For long moves, you can clean the filter and reintroduce it when you arrive at the destination. You may also want to throw it away and buy a new one.

, When you arrive at your destination, you should put your tank back together like it was before. Place decorations and rocks into the tank, and then fill it with the water you kept from the tank. Replace all the filters, heaters, and pumps. Then, place the live plants back in the aquarium."

Get a box, hopefully plastic.,
Stay calm.,
Put the lid on the box and make a run for it.",How to Save Your Fish Tank in a Natural Disaster," Try not to get metal or paper boxes. You need a box big enough to put your fish in, but light enough to carry out, because there will also be the added weight of the water.


If you have Betta fish, or multiple aggressive fish, it would be best to get a box with small dividers. Remember, at the point when you have to carry the fish out, it's best to have one you can carry. At that point, you want the smallest box possible.;
, Quickly take your jar and take the fish out, and put them in the box.

, When your house is breaking apart, the fish can handle the stress.

Secure its location.,
Secure a doily over it.,
Put a lid on it.,
Buy a secure tank.,
Move the fish.",How to Keep Fish when You Have Cats That Like to Hunt1," If you’re in protection mode for your fish, the first thing to think about is the location of the fish bowl or tank. Is it easy for your cat to jump up and peer inside? If so, find a spot that at least delays your cat’s intrusion into the fish ecosystem long enough for you to rescue the fish, such as up in a cabinet or on a high mantel.


Exploration is the name of a cat’s game, especially for a kitten. Try keeping the fish bowl away from surfaces cats like to jump on: tables, sideboards, cabinets, and bookshelves.;
, If you have any doilies on hand, put them to use over a fish bowl. Take a large rubber band and stretch a doily over the top of the fish bowl, snapping the rubber band in place under the lip of the bowl.You can sprinkle fish food into the bowl without having to remove a lid this way.
The doily should have a tight weave so that no cat could fit its paws or snout through the holes.

, If you don’t have any doilies or your fish container is too large, consider adding a lid. Test out any lid you already have on hand to see if the cat can penetrate it. Make sure the lid is very heavy or snaps onto the edges very tightly so that even you have a hard time getting it off.


Don't just place a heavy plate over the top. Cats can be very resourceful with a plate or other covering that isn’t secured in place.
Make sure there is a hole in the lid for airflow.You may be able to find a lid that fits your fish tank at a store that sells containers.

, If your current setup doesn’t allow you to place a secure lid on the fish container, consider purchasing a tank with a lid. Many pet stores and big box stores sell fish tanks and bowls with lids. , One sure-fire way to keep your cats out of the water of a fish bowl is to move the fish to a room where the cats don’t go. If you like looking at your fish, designate a room you frequent as a no-cat zone.


You could start blocking off a bathroom.
If you like the fish more as a decoration, you could lock it in an unused bedroom. Just be sure to go in this room everyday to feed the fish.

Turn off the aquarium lights before doing the steps below.,
First, open the plastic bag in which the fish is contained, but it is often sealed tightly with many elastic bands.,
Next, float the open-topped bag in the aquarium for 5-10 minutes to allow the temperatures to adjust.,
Now, use a clean (free of soap, etc...) cup to scoop some aquarium water into the bag.,
The last step is to use a net to gently scoop the fish into the aquarium.,
Sit back and enjoy your new fish, but you may want to leave the lights off for the first day if you have a nervous species.

",How to Introduce a Fish to an Aquarium,";
, If so, save yourself the hassle and just cut them off.

, Make sure it doesn't topple over.

, Repeat this step every five minutes over the span of half an hour until the bag is mostly aquarium water.

, This prevents contamination from the dealer’s tank into your aquarium. IMPORTANT: If the fish in the bag seem stressed you should just allow the bag to sink underwater and let the fish swim out, as netting can cause excess stress.

"
Ensure the tank is cycled before adding the first fish.,
Monitor water quality with test kits.,
Carry out regular water changes.,
Visually inspect the fish each day.,
Feed a good quality food once a day.,
Avoid contamination by substances such as perfumes, cleaners or detergents.,
Do not overstock the tank, or keep unsuitable species together.,
If fish do get ill, identify the illness and treat accordingly.",How to Prevent Fish From Getting Sick," This is crucial to fish health. Read the article on Fishless Cycling.;
, You need to test mainly for ammonia and nitrites - the two main causes of fish death and illness. These should both always be at 0. Nitrate and pH are also important- nitrates should stay below 20, and pH should not fluctuate.

, For a normally stocked community tank, changing 20-25% of the water every two weeks is enough, but in smaller tanks or heavily stocked tanks, more is needed. These are crucial to reducing nitrates, and if present, ammonia and nitrites.

, Look out for physical changes, like white spots, torn or damaged fins, white fluff, red sores or physical changes such as tumors. Spotting disease early makes treatment a lot easier and makes it a lot more likely for your fish to survive.

, Feed as much as they will eat in a few minutes and no more. Excess food will feed snails, which eat fish eggs and damage aquarium plants, or rot at the bottom of the tank. Give your fish frozen or live foods such as bloodworm once a week for variety. A small chunk of zucchini or broccoli, the same size as your pleco or other plant eaters, tied to a weight and sunk, will keep vegetarians in the tank happy. Only leave the vegetable in for two to three days/nights. Only put the vegetable in the tank once every three weeks.

, If these get into the water, they are highly toxic to fish.

, Doing so adds to stress of the fish, making them more susceptible to disease. Nipped fins can get infected, weakening fish and leaving them exposed to ailments that normally wouldn't bother them.

, Remember that few treatments can be used together. Check with an aquarium shop if in doubt.

Refrain from physical & verbal punishment.,
Instigate environmental punishments.,
Keep your cat off of surfaces.,
Distract your cat.,
Place a water bowl in front of the fish.",How to Keep Fish when You Have Cats That Like to Hunt2," Cats do not respond well to physical punishment like spankings and verbal punishments like yelling. Instead of learning not to repeat the behavior, the cat will learn to fear you and perform the naughty acts when you aren’t around.Keep in mind that cats have a real need to explore and hunt. Understanding this will help you have patience with your pet.You can walk away when a cat starts to play in a violent way (like a play attack).
You can also use a popgun, air horn, or squeeze bottle with water. Water in their faces when they can’t see the source will teach them not to return to the crime.

, Also called “remote punishment” or “booby trapping,” placing things in a cat’s environment it doesn’t like keeps it from repeating a behavior.For example, any textured surface cats don’t like can be placed around the fish, such as sticky paper, aluminum foil, or a plastic carpet runner with the nubby side turned up.
You can also place smells offensive to cats near the fish bowl. Cats hate the smell of eucalyptus, citronella, and wintergreen.

, Cats naturally enjoy being up high where they can survey their environment, but that also means they like to get up on counters and tables—where fish usually live. You can train them to stay off of your surfaces, however, by doing the following: Taking everything off of tabletops and counters, so there’s nothing to investigate.
Providing high, safe places to climb up to, like scratching posts.
Placing treats at safe spots both on the floor and up on cat posts.
Removing food and things of interest from the area near the fish bowl.

, Giving your cat interesting things to do will keep it occupied so that it “forgets” about the fish, or at least gets its energy and curiosity satisfied elsewhere. Don’t forget to exercise your cat by playing with it on a regular basis.


A motorized mouse can keep a cat occupied because it loves the chase. Good “mousing” breeds include both the American and British Shorthair, and mixed breed cats adopted from shelters.A ping-pong paddle with a ball attached by rubber band will exercise a cat if you sit and fling the ball out over and over.
Cats love to chase the tiny circle of a flashlight when it is moved around on surfaces.

, If your cat seems more interested in the water than the fish itself, this might just be a fascination with water or the container the water is in. Placing a small glass bowl of water in front of the fish bowl might distract your cat from the real thing.


Investing in a cat fountain can also be a solution to the water fascination. Since cats are naturally drawn to moving water because it makes them think of clean water in the wild, a pet fountain can be just what you need to tempt your cat away from the fish bowl."
"
Choose one or the other.,
Train your cat to live outside.,
Put your fish away.",How to Keep Fish when You Have Cats That Like to Hunt3," Another thing to consider is keeping only the fish or the cat, especially if nothing you try keeps your cat from attacking the fish bowl. Cats usually can't resist the fascination of a constantly moving, shimmering body, often exploring a fish bowl and eventually popping the fish in its mouth.Since this is is the case, getting rid of one or other might be best for both parties.


Decide which pet you have a greater attachment to, then give away the other one.

, Many people have outdoor cats. If your indoor cat will not stay away from the fish tank no matter what you do, you might try training your cat to live outside, at least part time.


Start slowly at first, dismissing your cat to the backyard for only 10 minutes the first day, then gradually increasing their outdoor time.
Feed your cat indoors and let them out and in at the same time everyday. Feeding your cat outside will attract wildlife.Give your cat a treat as soon as it comes inside each day to keep it wanting to come indoors.Having your cat inside only at certain times of day will allow you to properly protect the fish, perhaps locking up the fish when the cat is inside.

, When you leave the house, put your fish in a locked room so that the cat can’t get to it. Even if you believe your cat is trained to leave the fish alone, eliminating the possibility of mischief keeps your cat from being tempted.

Choose your pond container,and place it where you want it to be.

,
Build up the sides of your pond by stacking stones along the edges of your container until the top edge is concealed by a row of stones.

,
Run a hose from your kitchen sink or outdoor faucet to your container, and add ordinary tap water to your pond until the water level is about 3 inches(7.62 cm) from the top of your container.

,
Place a small submersible pump in the center of your pond.,
Turn on your submersible pump, and add a chlorinator to the pond water while it is running, to help keep the water clean.,
Decide what kind of plants you want to place around your pond and re-pot them in sand or clay.

,
Finish your pond by placing your plants around the edges of your pond.

",How to Build an Indoor Pond," Heavier ponds should be located on the lower levels of your home, such as your basement.;
,,,, This will keep the water from becoming stagnant by keeping it moving.

,


If you want to add goldfish to your pond, you will need to build up the sides of your pond and use an aquarium filter to keep the water clean rather than the chlorinator. Add the filter to the pond before you add the pump, and turn them on simultaneously.

Enjoy!",How to Build Your Own Fishing Pond," Designate a certain part of your yard for it. This area should be large enough so that the fish can roam, but small enough so that it stays on your land (unless the neighbors are okay with it).

, The longer it takes for the water to be sucked up, the better. If the ground is not suitable, don't worry, check out step 4. If the ground is good, continue to step 3.
, This hole will soon be your pond. The hole should take up all or most of your designated available area.
, over the dirt after you dig the hole. Make sure it looks nice and natural. If it looks sloppy or crappy, either do it over or make sure you can hide the faults with old tires, plants and rocks.
, Many fish eat wet land plants in their natural habitat. To anchor them without damaging their roots, take the roots in your hand and make a 'beak' with your fingers around them. Sink your hand into the bed and then open your fingers. This will make the roots spread out before the cover settles over them. (This is the same technique for planting in a tank, by the way.) Arrange them strategically so that they have good hiding places. You want your babies to be able to hide from larger predators that can and will eat them.
, There are 2 things that you can do for this, the first is wait for rain to come and fill up your hole. Your second option is to use your hose or a bucket to fill up the hole with water. Before using your hose, make sure the water's pH and all is balanced. Most tap water has chlorine in it to kill germs, but it also kills the good bacteria needed. To keep the bottom cover (sand, gravel, etc) from being mussed, aim your hose into a bucket. Don't forget to tie a long rope to that bucket, you probably won't want to dive into muddy water for it when the pond is full.
, Make sure you have species that won't kill each other right off, and that are all edible. Include cleaners such as crawdads (crayfish) to keep the bottom clean; make sure they have plenty of rocks to hide under. Before you put any fish into your pond, acclimatize them to the new water. Do this by putting them into a tub or bucket with their original water, then gradually adding your pond water until they are breathing almost pure pond water. Then net them and gently dump them into your pond.
, Congratulations, you are finished, now you can go right in your yard. In addition, if you live in a area where it gets under 55 degrees you should get a bubbler.

Fill the hole with water.",How to Build a Frog Pond," A good spot to build a pond is under the shade of a tree but with some direct sunlight. Frogs however, like a pond with plenty of shade and an area with enough plants to attract insects for food.;
, You can choose how big your pond is going to be and how deep you want it. Though you will want to make it a reasonable size. If you don't mind the time, work and effort you can make the pond bigger which attracts more frogs.

, The plastic will stop the water from sinking into the dirt and keep it in place. Other than plastic you can also leave a cement mix to dry inside the hole, this will also keep the water in place.

, Try to fill the hole to the brim with the hose water. If it's in a rainy season and you have patience you could wait until the rain water fills the hole up.

Screed and smooth out finish.",How to Build a Concrete Pond," If you have a concept in mind, sketch the basic shape. Take into consideration the yard layout and your budget, which will dictate the size and style of the pond. Calculate your budget by making a list of the materials you'll need.


Search Internet sites and home and garden magazines for concrete pond plans. Visit parks or friends' yards for ideas.
To build a concrete pond, plan carefully. If necessary, revise the plan before breaking ground to avoid extra costs.
The proximity of the house and your property line may determine the dimensions and location of the pond. Keep in mind zoning ordinances and easements.;
, Ask the building inspector at city hall about restrictions or requirements, like permits or surveys. Also schedule an inspection from the utility company to examine the area before beginning the project.


It's imperative to locate any water pipes or underground gas, electrical, or communication lines before digging.

, Prepare the yard by clearing away rocks, debris and other obstacles. Any trees or bushes should be completely uprooted to prevent roots from growing back and cracking the concrete.

, If you're going to build a concrete pond on a large scale, you'll need to rent a front end loader, and hire a concrete truck for delivery. On a smaller scale project, an electric concrete mixer, shovels, hoes, and a wheelbarrow could suffice.

, Regardless of the dimensions, keep any dirt, debris, rocks, etc. from falling back into the hole. Be sure the rim is level all the way around. Pack the earth down by driving around the rim.

, Place a layer of plastic around the perimeter of the pond, covering the dirt. Stretch wire around entire perimeter. Depending on the size of the pond, also use chicken cage wire for reinforcing.


Install re-bar or fence wire above the ground with stakes. This allows the metal to dry in the center of the concrete, giving extra strength.

, Keep the consistency a bit thick to line the sloped edges of the pond. Ideally, the sides should be hand mixed, as many concrete truck drivers keep the mixture ""wet,"" which could cause it to run.


Concrete pond walls and floor should be around 4 inches (10.2 cm) thick. Follow additional instructions from the concrete manufacturer.

, Use a screed (a board or strip of metal) to smooth and level the concrete. Use trowels for a smooth finish. Depending on the temperature and humidity, hardening usually occurs within 2 hours of initial mixing. Leveling and smoothing should be complete by then.

Finishing touches.",How to Build a Backyard Pond," If you're going to use a filter or pump, make sure there's electric service available. Don't put your pond under a tree; additional maintenance will be required.;
, Rope, extension cords or garden hoses work best to lay out the outline of your pond and streams. If you're using a rigid pond liner, it'll be a matter of matching the shape of the liner, but make the hole slightly bigger. If you are using a flexible liner, continue to adjust the size and shape until you are happy with the look. Also make sure you leave enough surrounding area around you pond for adequate landscaping. Once your layout is final, use spray paint to paint the outline of your pond.

, After contacting your local authorities and verifying that there are not any buried utilities where you plan to dig, it's time to excavate. You can either dig your pond with a shovel or rent a backhoe. Your pond should be dug with a variety of depth levels so you can utilize these levels as plant shelves. To build these shelves, you need to hand dig the edges of the pond with a shovel to get the chiseled edges you desire. Plan on having your perimeter edge 3"" to 5"" (7-12cm) over the desired water level of the pond. make your pond at least 2 feet (0.6 m) deep.

, If you're going to use a skimmer, dig a place for it. Once your water level has been determined, you should set the height for the skimmer. You should have your skimmer nearly directly across from your filter or the discharge of your stream in order to provide good flow and allow the skimmer to work its best. The perfect set up is having the water level 1"" (2.5cm) below the top of the throat in the skimmer.

, This article uses an Aqua Falls biological filter, which is designed for use with a skimmer. The front of the filter is tipped forward 1"" (2.5cm) and must be level from side to side.

, Check the newly excavated area to make sure it is free of any sharp objects that could puncture the liner. Installing the underlayment is very easy – just unfold and place the underlayment into the pond. If there is more than one section, be sure to overlap them a few inches. Do your best to make the underlayment conform to the shape of your pond and plant shelves. Don’t trim the extra underlayment until you have filled the pond. Install the pond liner in the same manner as the underlayment. (If it is a rigid liner, just place it in the excavated area.) Make sure you keep plenty of extra liner at the perimeter banks of your pond and near your filter.

, Rocks provide surface area for necessary bacteria, protect your liner from harm and add natural beauty. Start by placing the rocks on the vertical walls. For the vertical sections you will need to use larger rocks – they should be 6” to 12” (15-30cm) in diameter. You can even use a few very large rocks as focal points as well. Once your vertical sections are done, you can fill your horizontal areas with septic stone – 1” to 2” (2-5cm) stone. Once your stone is done, you can start filling the pond with water.

, Verify the skimmer pit you have dug fits your skimmer. Make sure the bottom of the pit is flat. Check the water level height to the skimmer throat – remember set the water height 1” lower than the top of the skimmer throat opening. Check if it is level side to side. Every skimmer is slightly different so you will need to follow the installation instructions carefully that came with your skimmer. Only backfill the dirt around the skimmer about 6” (15cm) deep, you can’t back fill any further until after you have made your PVC connections plus you shouldn’t backfill it further until it is full of water otherwise it will bend in slightly and the filter rack and lid won’t fit properly. Attaching the liner to the skimmer works much better with 2 people. Place a large bead of silicone over the face plate opening and around the mounting holes. Have 1 person hold the liner flat up against the silicone and skimmer while the other person makes a hole through the liner with something sharp like an ice pick or nail then puts a bolt into each hole and makes them all tight. After everything is tight, you can trim the liner from the inside of the skimmer using a sharp knife or razor. Screw the check valve assembly from the kit onto the pump. Next you can move on to placing the pump in the skimmer and making the flexible PVC connections utilizing the provided flexible PVC and bulkhead fittings.

, This filter installs similar to the skimmer. It should tip forward about 1” and then be perfectly level side to side. Use a second person to make the silicone connection of the liner to the filter. Place a large bead of silicone over the face plate opening and around the mounting holes. Have 1 person hold the liner flat up against the silicone and filter while the other person makes a hole through the liner with something sharp like an ice pick or nail then puts a bolt into each hole and makes them all tight. After everything is tight, you can trim the liner using a sharp knife or razor. Next you can move on to making the connections utilizing the provided PVC and bulkhead fittings. Insert the filter pads and media bags and then place the rock cover over the filter. Later you can place rocks and plant on the cover to conceal the filter. It is wise to ""frame"" the waterfall filter by placing two boulders on each side and then placing your waterfall rocks in the middle at a lower height. These will need to be foamed in with black waterfall foam so that water runs over the rocks and not under.

, Your pond is complete and should be close to full with water. Now you can install your accessories and begin to landscape around your pond. Trim away large excess liner and underlayment. Always leave several inches of extra liner when trimming then bury it with small stones. When your water level reaches the desired level, plug in the pump and let it begin to work.There will be a great deal of cloudiness in the pond from the dirt and rocks. It will go away in a couple of days. Follow the instructions on balancing your pH level and adding your bacteria. Let the pond sit for a few days before adding any fish or plants.

Stock the pond.",How to Build a Garden Pond," Try to choose a position where you can admire the pond from your favourite sitting-out position. The ideal pond site is in a sunny spot, sheltered from cold northerly winds and well away from trees that shed their leaves.;
, Pond liners can be used to create a formal or informal shape. The formal will be a square, rectangle or circle, while the latter can be any shape you like within reason: it's best to avoid curves and inlets that are too 'sharp'. The simplest way of establishing the shape and size you want is to lay garden hose or rope out on the pond site, and to view it from various positions.

, You can create a pond either by sinking a preformed rigid plastic or glass fiber shell in the ground, or by lining the excavation with a flexible liner. The latter is the more popular choice for several reasons: it's easier to transport since it comes folded in a box; it's easier to install, it also allows you complete freedom of choice as far as the pond shape and depth is concerned.

, Decide at this stage whether you want to incorporate extra features such as a waterfall, a fountain, garden lighting, and the like in your pond construction. Apart from the relaxing sound moving water creates, the movement helps to aerate the water too.

, If you're using a pump to circulate water to a fountain or waterfall, and perhaps using outdoor lights, you'll need a power supply to the vicinity of the pond.

, Digging big holes creates a surprisingly large amount of spoil, so unless you can disperse it elsewhere in the garden or you are planning to use it as the base for a rockery or other raised feature, you will have to order a skip and have it taken away.

, Take your time in deciding what shape of pond you want, adjusting the hose position and viewing the shape from an upstairs window to get a better idea of how its shape and proportions fit in with the garden as a whole. If you are having an informal shape, avoid sharp curves; gentle sweeps look more natural.

, When you're happy with the shape and size, cut round the perimeter with a spade or lawn edger. Then cut across the pond area in parallel lines about 300mm apart, and lift the resulting strips of turf.

, Start excavating the pond area down to the marginal shelf level, saving good topsoil for use elsewhere in the garden. For the deluxe pond, dig down to a depth of about 320mm (121/2"") below ground level which will give you an eventual water depth of about 230mm (9""). Slope the sides at an angle of about 45°, clearing any roots and sharp stones as you work, then check that the base of the excavation is roughly level using your spirit level set on a timber straightedge.

, Next, mark out the area that will form the 'deep end' of the pond. This is normally the central area, but it is not essential to have a marginal shelf all the way round. Excavate the main section to a depth of between 550 and 700mm (21 to 27"") below ground (lawn) level; the latter is better, since it guarantees that the pond cannot freeze solid in winter. Your eventual water depth in this area will be about 450 to 600mm (18 to 24"").

, Double-check that there are no stones left which could puncture the liner, especially on the edges of the marginal shelf or the slopes down into the deep end. Then line the excavation with a maximum 25mm (1"") thick layer of damp building sand, patting it into place on the slopes and firming it down on the bottom and the marginal shelves.

, With the excavation complete, the next step is to remove turf round the pond to allow for the edging stones. Use an angle grinder to cut slabs to fit if necessary but make sure that you are wearing a nose and mouth mask and goggles for protection. Lay the stones in place so they overlap the pond edge by about 50mm (2""), and mark their outer edges on the grass with your spade. Then lift the slabs aside, cut and lift the turf and remove the topsoil to a depth of about 65mm (21/2"") - enough to allow the slabs to be bedded on mortar once the pond is filled. Check that this perimeter strip is perfectly level all round; if it is not, parts of the liner will be exposed above the water level, and will begin to deteriorate due to exposure to sunlight.

, Drape the liner over the excavation without disturbing the sand or any underlay, aiming for an even overlap all round. On concave curves, pleat and fold it neatly. Don't make it fit the pond contours precisely at this stage though. It will look better if it is allowed to stretch slightly as it is filled, since this will help to pull out many of the creases. When you're happy with its positioning, anchor its perimeter with bricks or stones.

, If you are having a waterfall, now is the time to install a liner - in an existing rockery, or on a new earth bank. Use an off-cut from the main liner. Form the top pool first with a depth of about 120mm (41/2""), then create a channel for the liner down to the pool. One of the easiest ways of doing this is to lay roof ridge tiles upside down in the channel to form the cascade, and then to position the liner over them and tuck the excess material underneath. Alternatively, lay the liner directly in the channel, anchor its edges with stones, and use pieces of paving slab underneath it to help form steps over which the flow can cascade. Position another slab at the point where the waterfall will discharge into the pond, to ensure that the water does not 'miss' the pond edge. Then bury a length of 25mm (1"") hose running from the pump position in the deep end of the pond, over the pond edge and up the slope to the top of the waterfall, covering it with pieces of slate, tile or similar so it is not squashed when buried or pierced by gardening tools.

, Start filling the liner with water from a garden hose. As it fills, neaten folds as necessary and ease off the perimeter bricks to allow the liner to bed against the contours of the excavation. As the water level nears the top edge of the liner, check to see how level the pond perimeter is and scrape away soil to get rid of any high spots or make up low spots with well compacted sand. Fill the liner to within 25mm (1"") of the top.

, Trim off excess liner all the way round the pond with a sharp knife, leaving an overlap of about 230mm (9"") which will be concealed by the edging stones. If you are planning to turf-up to the pond edge at any point, cut slits in the overlap so the grass roots can grow through them into the soil below.

, Tidy up the site, and lay the edging stones round the pond on a 25mm (1"") thick mortar bed. It is not safe to bed them on sand, as you would on a patio, since someone standing on the edge might tilt the slab and be thrown into the water. Check that the slabs are level, and point between them. If you are having a pump and waterfall, conceal the hose to the waterfall by positioning it between two slabs, and set a short length of copper pipe or plastic conduit beneath the slabs to allow the pump flex to be passed through safely and unobtrusively.

, Run in the power supply, using 1.5mm2 toughened twin and earth cable buried at least 500mm (20"") underground between the house and the pond site. At the pond end, pass the pump flex through the pipe or conduit under the perimeter paving and connect it to the toughened cable within a weatherproof junction box; then form an above-ground chamber for the box which you can later conceal with rocks or shrubs. The simplest solution is to set the box on a brick or block and cover it with a ridge tile; alternatively, mount it on a low timber post and shield it from the weather by making a small canopy for it from exterior quality plywood or fencing offcuts. Indoors, run 1.0mm2 twin and earth cable to the consumer unit position and connect to either a spare fuse-way or miniature circuit breaker (MCB) in a new consumer unit mounted nearby. You must call a qualified electrician or your local electricity company to connect this unit to your mains supply. Fit a 6-amp fuse in the fuse-way, or use a 6-amp MCB, and label it 'POND SUPPLY'. Now connect the waterfall hose to the pump outlet, and set the pump in the pond on bricks or pieces of paving slab so the fountain jet is just above water level. Switch on the power by turning the residual current device to ON, so you can test the system. Adjust the water flow as necessary using the flow adjuster. Do not restrict the flow too much as this can damage the pump over a period of time.

, Complete the pond installation by adding marginal, deep-water and oxygenating plants. Remember that your pond will only support plant and aquatic life if the surface area is about 3m2 (32sq.ft) or larger. Don't worry if the water goes green initially; it will clear as the plants establish themselves. Wait a few weeks before stocking the pond with fish.

Think of what kind of pond you'd like to create and consider the aesthetic of your lawn or garden. Examples of ponds that you can build include a miniature koi pond, a frozen winter themed pond, or even a science-fiction toxic sludge pond. Once you settle on an idea, you can create a pond that reflects what you want to create.Consider different pond themes depending on the season or holiday.

For example, during the autumn you can create a Halloween inspired miniature pond with mini pumpkins, ghouls, and ghosts.
During the winter you can create a festive holiday pond with snow.

;
, Once you have a theme in mind, it's time that you start designing the look of your pond. Use a pencil and paper to sketch out a rough design of your pond. Remember to add the features for the ground around the actual pond, as well as the pond itself. Once you settle on a design that you like, you can begin to build your project.


Draw the overall shape of the pond before you start moving into finer details like rocks, plants, and other features that will surround the pond.
Your pond can have ragged or smooth edges.
If you want to keep it simple, draw an oval pond with no fine details.

, The size of styrofoam you should get depends on how large you want your miniature pond to be. After you've designed the pond on a separate piece of paper, it's time that you transfer the image to your styrofoam. Use a marker to copy the design that you've created directly onto the face of the styrofoam. Draw the outer edges of your project before moving towards the center and drawing finer details.


A great miniature pond size is a 1x1 feet (30.48x30.48 cm).
Special details that you may want to add include bridges, foliage, fish, trees, pipes, waterfalls, and branches., Use an X-Acto knife to follow the lines you drew and cut around the edges of your pond base. Keep in mind that the base isn't only the pond itself, but the land that will be around the pond. Once you finish with the outer edges, this will serve as the base for your miniature pond.

, Use your X-Acto knife to dig around the outlines that you created for your pond. The depth of your pond will depend on how deep you cut when creating it. Make sure to leave at least a half of an inch of styrofoam when gouging your hole. Do not cut through the styrofoam when making your pond or else the resin won't have anywhere to harden.


To add texture to the bottom of the pond, leave jagged edges and cuts when digging out your styrofoam.

, Continue to cut out other details in your pond, such as rocky cliffs or places where the land will dip in. Make sure to vary up the depth of your land so that your pond doesn't look flat. Adding texture to the landscape around your pond will give it a more realistic look.

, A base coat of plaster will prevent the resin from eating through the styrofoam when you pour it. Purchase Plaster of Paris from the hardware store and apply a coat of it to the entirety of your styrofoam base. If there are cracks or places that you missed, let the first coat of plaster dry and go over your base again with another coat.Once you lay down your plaster, allow the base to dry for a couple of hours or overnight.
You can use a rough sandpaper to sand down rough areas before applying another coat of plaster.

, Once the plaster has dried on your pond's base, you can start to paint it with acrylic craft paint that you can find at most arts and crafts stores. Use a brush to lay down basecoats for large details like the bottom of the pond and the area around the pond. You can also draw smaller details like fish or animals directly onto the plaster base. Remember to try to stay within your theme and choose colors that fit the aesthetic of your pond.


The color of the bottom of your pond area will dictate the color of pond after you pour the resin in.
Bright greens and browns work well with a koi pond.
Browns, grays, and light greens work well with a toxic sludge pond.
Add the impression of depth by painting the middle of your pond a darker shade than the outer edges of your pond., Adding details to your pond and the area around your pond will add complexity to your model. Consider adding things like miniature fish, lily pads, ducks, rabbits, or other wildlife created out of clay. To create these small additions, use a polymer clay to form them before heating them in an oven to harden them.


Other details you can add include large rock formations, waterfalls, people, lamp posts, or anything else that you can imagine., Once these tiny clay details have hardened, you can paint them to add depth to them. Once your paint has dried, glue them to your miniature pond with gorilla glue or superglue. Gluing things into the hole that you gorged for the pond will make them appear as if they are swimming in the pond once your pour your resin.If you want your details to appear like they are floating on water, you'll have to glue them to the surface of your resin once it has dried.

, Instead of creating clay models for all the details in your miniature pond, you can use things that you find in your garden. Gather up pebbles, small stones, leaves, or tufts of grass from your yard and glue them around the exterior of your pond.


You can also use small seashells if you are creating a coastal miniature pond.

, Craft resin will usually come in two containers containing the resin and a hardener. You'll have to mix these together to create a usable resin for your pond. Make sure to read the directions on the resin's packaging carefully before mixing the solutions together. Combine the solutions in the recommended amount according to the instructions and stir it for five minutes, or until both chemicals are mixed thoroughly.Only mix a small amount of resin at a time.

, Once the resin has been mixed, you can slowly and carefully pour it into the spot that you made for your pond. If you don't have enough resin to fill your pond's basin, mix more in another glass and continue to fill it until your satisfied.Applying heat to the resin with a blow-dryer after your pour it can remove the bubbles from your resin pond.

, Allow your project to dry out for 24 hours before trying to move it or adding any additional details. Once it has dried, you can spot paint and fill in your final details until the pond looks the way that you want and you are satisfied.

Ask a veterinarian if possible.,
Look up your species.,
Keep the fish in a low-stimulation environment.,
Withhold food for 24–48 hours before drug euthanasia.,
Continue on to one of the methods below.",How to Humanely Kill a Fish1," There are many species of aquarium fish, and for most of them the ideal drug dosages and other conditions are unknown. A veterinarian is trained to notice signs of suffering and adjust the process if necessary, giving your fish a less painful death.


Only methods reasonable to perform at home are included in this article. Other methods, such as electrocution and lethal injection, are difficult to perform humanely without training, and/or can harm the person performing them.;
, An ice bath or a particular drug may be humane for one fish species, and cause suffering in another.Wherever possible, the instructions below give you the information you need to avoid a mistake. However, an online search for euthanasia information of your specific species can lead to a more concrete recommendation. Most fish species have not been studied, but it's still worth a few minutes in case yours has.

, Keep the fish in a quiet room. Block light with an opaque aquarium lid, or switch to red lighting, which will barely penetrate the water. These measures will reduce the amount of light stimulation the fish gets, while leaving enough light for you to work., Unless the fish is at death's door, wait until the fish has gone without food for this long. The fish will absorb the lethal drug more quickly on an empty stomach, and be less likely to regurgitate it.Skip this step if you are using a method that does not involve drugs.

, All the methods listed below are humane ways to euthanize a fish. Read the instructions carefully before you begin. Not all methods are appropriate for all species. A euthanasia bath is not appropriate for fish you intend to eat.

Plan according to the type of fish you have.,
Know your options.,
Provide live plants or vegetables.,
Combine these methods to care for a variety of fish.,
Still, if you have different groups of fish diets in your tank, all with their own special food, it would be best to get someone who can spend enough time to make sure each group is satisfied.

,
Cover your tank securely.,
Get somebody to take care of your fish.,
Talk to your fish-sitter about your fish before you leave.,
Keep the fish tank clean.,
Test your water when you come back.",How to Keep a Fish from Dying While You Are on Holiday," If you are gone a couple of days, most fish should be fine without food. If you are on a month long trip, your fish will require food.;
, Whenever you leave your fish to travel, there will always be risks. If you have rare and expensive fish, always make sure that you have the proper care plan laid out, and make sure it is as foolproof a plan as possible.

, Different fish have different dietary needs. Be sure to know exactly what kinds of fish you have.


Carnivores require live food and/or carnivore pellets.
Omnivores: A large amount of fish fall into this category. Most fish in this group could be fed a food block(bought from a local fish store). Feeder blocks work by encasing food in a block of minerals that dissolves gradually in water over several days. For omnivores with a stricter diet of pellets and dried foods, use the automatic vacation feeder as described in the carnivore section.
Herbivores: These are fish with a vegetable and plant diet. If you can feed them dried seaweed or vegetables, then use the vacation feeder. If they must get fresh vegetables than it would be best to get someone to come over and feed your fish.

, There are several methods of feeding fish during your absence. The length of your vacation will impact your choice but it is always a good idea to have someone check now and then, especially if the electricity goes off in your area (which only a neighbor will know about).


Get a vacation feeder and fill the compartments with the correct food for your fish. The feeder will automatically release food into the water according to a schedule that you program into it. This method is only suitable for fish that take pellet and flake like foods, as it will not hold bloodworms and other live foods. Freeze-dried bloodworms are available.
Put feeder fish of varied sizes in the tank. It is key to put different sized feeder fish into the tank as the predator will eat some first, and some later, according to size. Do not put live worms into the tank as they will foul up your water.
Use a feeder block. Go to your local pet store and buy a suitable feeder block for your fish. It's best to experiment with a few before you go away, as some fish will reject certain feeder blocks. Place the block into the bottom of the fish tank on the day you go away. If you are going away for a long time, organize for someone to come replace the feeder block every 5 to 7 days.
Have someone come over and feed your fish. This is the best method, especially if your fish are picky eaters, but make sure that they have enough time to feed your fish, and know how, when and what to feed them.

, With some fish you could place a large clump of vegetables in the tank with a weight, and they would eat it over time. Even if you don't like zucchini, it's possible your fish will.

, It is possible to satisfy two of the groups, as omnivores can eat carnivore and herbivore's food.

,, Fish like Bichirs and spiny eels tend to crawl out of holes in your tank, so make sure there are no escape points where the fish could get out. If you have a pond and need to prepare it for the winter, now would not be the time to leave.

, Ask around. Sometimes pet shops have services where you pay them to come over and feed your fish.


Unknown people have full access to your house. This makes it important that the person you choose is properly vetted or is known to you. If you do not feel comfortable with strangers in your house, ask a family member or a friend. Alternatively, a pet sitting service whose clients have been police verified can be an alternative, although more costly.

, Tell them everything they need to know, especially about how much to feed, and also leave a written instruction sheet for their reference. If you can't find anyone at all to take care of your fish, it would be best not to leave. If you do, you are taking extreme risks, and it is likely your fish won't survive., You really don't need to worry about this too much. Before you go on vacation, do a water change within the week before you leave. Make sure that if you have someone coming over to feed your fish they know how much to feed, and won't pollute your water. Clean your tank again soon after you return.

, Hopefully, nothing went wrong while you were gone, but check for any spikes in ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate. You may have to perform large water changes until your water is back to normal.

"
Prepare a separate tank.,
Consider using MS-222.,
Try alcohol instead.,
Use clove oil cautiously.,
Transfer the fish.,
Wait until the fish is dead.",How to Humanely Kill a Fish2," Unless all the fish in a tank need to be euthanized, you'll need a second container. Transfer some of the water from the current tank to a new, clean container, preferably with a similar aeration and temperature control setup.Using water from a different source or at a different temperature can stress the fish, or cause an inhumane death.


Some drugs, including MS-222, may not be effective in temperatures below 10ºC (50ºF).
Euthanizing a large tank of fish is difficult, and requires measurements of oxygen and chemical concentration for best dosage calculations.Ask a veterinarian to perform this if at all possible.

, Also sold as tricaine methanesulfonate, ""Finquel,"" or ""Tricaine-S"" at pet stores, this is the most reliable option of the widely available drugs. You can find this at pet supply stores.This is the only widely available drug approved by the FDA for this purpose.Use 5–10 times the amount the label recommends for anaesthesia, usually 250 to 500 mg/L.Do not eat fish killed this way.

, Another option is 95+% ethanol, available at laboratory supply stores and some hardware stores. Use 10–30 mL ethanol for each liter of water (2–6 tbsp per quart), at the same temperature as the tank water.Vodka will work as well, if you increase the amount based on the strength. For example, 63% vodka requires 1.5 times as much by volume to reach the same alcohol concentration.

, It's not easy to tell how concentrated a given bottle of clove oil is, or even what exactly it contains. It may put your fish to sleep but fail to kill it. The fish will not be safe for eating, and the water may cause harm if dumped in the water supply.If you decide to use it, try this method:Shake one drop in water until milky, then add to the tank.
When the fish is asleep at the bottom, shake and add another 13 drops per liter of water (50 drops per gallon).

, Once you've added the chosen drug, net the fish and quickly move it to the euthanasia bath. Handle as little as possible to avoid causing stress.

, Any euthanizing drug can send the fish to sleep if too little is used. Death often takes 30 minutes to arrive, and you may need to wait 2 hours to be sure.Watch carefully for the following signs of death:No movement of gill flap for 10 minutes. (Usually following spasms 1 minute apart.)
No movement of eye when fish is rocked from side to side.
Very slow heart rate. The heart may continue after death, but a strong, persistent beat means the fish is alive.
If you do not see these signs within an hour or two, or if the fish wakes up again, add more of the drug.
If you want to be certain the fish is dead, kill it with the physical methods below, or freeze it in ice water. These should not cause pain if the fish is deeply anaesthetized.

"
"
Consider your own ability and reaction.,
Macerate tiny fish.,
Knock the fish unconscious (optional).,
Decapitate the fish.,
Pith the brain immediately.",How to Humanely Kill a Fish3," These methods are only humane if you can perform them accurately and quickly. Skip to a different section if you think the sight of gore or a struggling fish will affect you. These methods are usually used to kill food fish or laboratory research subjects, not family pets.


Unless you're experienced with fish anatomy, practice on dead fish first so you can perform these quickly and without mistakes.

, Fish less than 2 cm (¾ inch) long can be killed instantly in a fish macerator, which chops it apart with rapidly moving blades.Make sure to use a macerator intended for exactly your size of fish.


The larger the fish is, the less humane this death is. Even if you have a macerator intended for larger fish, it may cause suffering.

, Stun the fish by clubbing it just above the eyes, with an appropriately sized, hard object. Repeat with more force if the fish is still conscious.There is evidence that at least some fish species can remain conscious after decapitation, so this step is highly recommended.Fish species adapted for low oxygen conditions are more likely to remain conscious after decapitation., Hold down the head and sever it with a powerful motion from a sharp knife, just behind the skull.Alternatively, you can insert the knife behind the skull and sever the spinal cord and vertebrae. This ""cervical transection"" is less messy, but not recommended unless you have experience with fish anatomy.

, Even after decapitation, the fish may still be alive for a short time. Ensure a rapid death by immediately inserting a sharp spike or knife into the brain, between the eyes. Push forward and backward to destroy the brain and the end of the spinal cord.You can use online resources to locate the most effective point to insert the spike, for various edible species."

Check the dimensions of your pond.,
Ensure the pond liner is appropriate and intact.,
Add filtration to your garden pond.,
Add oxygenating plants.,
Be certain the pond is settled before adding fish.,
Add goldfish to your garden pond.,
Choose Koi fish for your garden pond.,
Introduce golden orfe fish to your garden pond.,
Add Plecostomus or mosquito fish to your garden pond.,
Combat algae overgrowth.,
Maintain water levels.,
Keep your garden pond free of contaminates.,
Feed your fish.",How to Add Fish to a Garden Pond," In order to stock your garden pond with fish, you will need to make sure the pond is large enough to support the fish you intend to introduce. Fish need a certain amount of space, as well as variation in depth.Your pond should have a minimum 12-15 square feet of surface area in order to add fish.
The pond will need one area that is greater than two feet deep for hibernating amphibians if you intend to have any frogs.
The pond will also need a number of areas that are under one foot in depth to support different species of aquatic plant life.;
, If your garden pond is manmade, it likely has a liner to hold the water in. The material of the liner is made of isn’t the only thing to look out for. The slope the liner creates in the pond is also important depending on the types of plant life and animals you intend to keep in the pond.Pond linings are usually made from clay, concrete or pre-formed plastic.
Plastic linings may create too steep a slope to the pond to maintain amphibians in your garden pond.
Make sure the lining is intact and holds water, or that the pond is filled from a continuous source to be certain the pond won’t drain once you stock it with fish.

, While there are some kinds of fish you can keep in a garden pond without any form of filtration, your options can be significantly increased if you choose to add a mechanical or biological filter. Either filter system can be purchased in specialty stores or even large hardware stores.Mechanical filters require more frequent cleaning, as they rely on sponges or other filters to capture particles as they flow through the water.
Biological filters can simply be placed in the pond, but may require that you ensure the water quality remains within acceptable parameters for the bacteria in the filter.
Goldfish and Koi fish can both be kept without a filtration system.

, Keep your fish happy and healthy by maintaining a high oxygen level in the water of your garden pond. There are plants you can purchase that will naturally add oxygen to the water of your pond without any additional equipment.Anacharis is considered the best plant for oxygenating purposes. It is commonly recommended that you add one bunch of anacharis for each square foot of your garden pond to keep the water oxygen levels optimal for fish.
Water sprites also serve as capable oxygenators but are not quite as effective.

, You need to be certain that the water quality is high enough to maintain a population of fish and that the plants and filtration devices are settled and established before introducing fish to your garden pond. Do this by completing the following:


Be sure plant roots are covered with soil and gravel to prevent fish from accidentally uprooting and killing them as they swim.
Use a water tester to check the PH levels of the water. Ideally, your pond should be between a 7.2 and 7.8 PH level.
Wait for your plants to begin growing in your pond to ensure they will survive being transplanted.

, Goldfish are the most common and most popular choice of fish for garden ponds. Goldfish are hardy fish that require very little supervision and often do not even require a filtration system for your pond.Goldfish can live for years in well maintained garden ponds.
There are a number of colors and patterns goldfish can be found in.
Goldfish are also available in a series of different body types thanks to selective breeding. Goldfish options are really quite varied.

, Koi fish are the second most common type of fish to be found in garden ponds. They are a resilient breed of fish but may require filtration systems to be kept healthy. Koi fish can survive for years in well maintained ponds.Koi fish can grow to be up to 2-3 feet and even weigh as much as 35 pounds in large enough garden ponds.
Koi fish regularly live to be fifty years old in well maintained garden ponds.
Ponds with less than a thousand-gallon capacity may not be well suited for koi fish because of their ability to grow so large in size.

, Golden orfe fish are quick moving fish that prefer to live in schools. They tend to be yellowish orange and can be considered high maintenance fish for garden ponds and similar situations.Golden orfe fish require water quality that is significantly higher than that of goldfish or koi fish, which makes them less popular for garden ponds.
Never introduce fewer than three golden orfes to a pond, as they may not survive when not in numbers.

, These last two types of garden pond fish are less common than others because they may require additional care or considerations as compared to the other more common types of pond fish.Plecostomus fish start very small but can grow up to two feet in length and cannot survive colder months in a garden pond. Some owners with large fish tanks take their Plecostomus fish indoors for the winter.
Mosquito fish do not grow to be very large and tend to look like guppies. They are commonly introduced to ponds to eat mosquito larvae before they have a chance to hatch, but goldfish and koi fish will both serve the same purpose.

, Algae can become a serious issue to maintaining appropriate oxygen levels in your garden pond. Algae absorbs oxygen and its growth prevents sunlight from reaching plants beneath the surface.Remove things that are shading your garden pond, as algae will grow in the shade.
Make sure to remove overgrown oxygenator plants or water lilies.
Adding store bought algaecide will keep algae from becoming an issue in your pond.

, Making sure your fish survive in the garden pond will require that you maintain a fairly even water level and quality. In order to do so, you will need to check the level of water in your garden pond regularly and add chemicals if necessary to restore the PH balance.Top off the water level on hot days as you lose water to evaporation.
Check the PH balance when water levels change to ensure it remains within acceptable standards for your fish.
Treat the water as necessary to retain PH balance as you add water.

, You will need to keep your garden pond clean from floating materials that could injure your fish or affect the water quality. Doing so is fairly easy with basic pool cleaning equipment.Use a pool skimmer to remove fallen leaves and other things floating in the water.
Use a net to remove larger objects or dead wildlife from your pond to ensure you keep the other wildlife healthy.

, While your pond will probably provide plenty of food for your fish naturally through insects and plants, it’s important to add high quality fish food to make sure your fish receive all the nutrients they need to live a long, healthy life.Go to a pet store to find the right kind of food for the fish you choose to add to your garden pond.
You can purchase feeding stations that will distribute food for you if you are unable to get to your garden regularly.

Enjoy your pet fish!",How to Ensure Your Pet Fish Are Healthy," You don't want to bother your fish by constantly moving around and adding surroundings. For most tanks, a filter, heater, air pump, fake/real plants, substrate, and hiding places are enough. Each species has its own preferences, though, so research. Saltwater and brackish tanks are also different from freshwater.
, Many pet owners do not realize that just running the tank's pump and filter for a few day (as recommended by many pet stores) is not enough. Cycling is where beneficial bacteria levels are slowly increased by feeding the bacteria ammonia. Ammonia turns to nitrite, which turns to nitrate. The bacteria will make sure that ammonia from rotting food and waste in the tank is quickly neutralized into nitrate, which is less harmful and can be removed with weekly/monthly water changes.

Good bacteria in an aquarium are the ones that form a biological filter. Bacteria break down ammonia and nitrites so that the water is better for the fish. Without good bacteria most life would not exist. The ""bad"" bacteria are normally also present but do not cause problems until fish are injured, stressed by dirty water, or suffering from another disease.

, General fish food like ""tropical"" or ""freshwater"" won't cut it. Specific species of fish have their own diet, and flakes tend to be of lower quality. Seek out higher quality food (research for your type of fish). Treats, like with other pets, are important too. Some fish enjoy meat, some insects, and some bits of vegetable., Especially for saltwater, sensitive, or expensive fish -- you want to be prepared when some disease hits. Basics include aquarium salt (not the same as marine salt), fungicides, and not just general purpose infection remedies, but different antibiotics for different severity of infections, and fin repair necessities.

It's important to note, however, that some invertebrates (worms) will die in the presence of certain medications.

, This is optional for some but a necessity for others, as this tank can be a breeding tank or a quarantine tank. For people who are serious about breeding, this is needed, cycled and all to protect eggs and fry (baby fish). Many people also use this to quarantine sick fish so they do not infect the rest of the tank. This extra tank needs to be cycled, have a filter, heater (depending on species) and air pump. However, it is usually left bare bottom (no substrates like sand or gravel) and with barely any decorations., Look for vibrant colors, alertness, no white skin patches, torn fins, overly red gills, and no swollen body (for pregnant fish, this may be hard to differentiate). Pay attention to where the fish is housed. Is it in a cramped space with 15 other fish, or does it have space to swim and be healthy? Is there an overgrowth of algae? Is it kept in a tiny bowl/cup? Consider the surrounding tanks and fish in the shop, not just the fish in question.

Watch out for fin infection by comparing fish. This infection often begins with easily unnoticed red streaks in a fin(s) -- soon followed by abnormal lightening of edge colors, perhaps still not noticed at a glance. Then a fraying and rotting of the fin membrane and edges occurs. This infection can lead to totally disabling the fin, spreading to the body and leading to death., If you want a tropical fish but your tank is more like for cold water, do not just say ""It's fine"" and buy the fish anyway. Your tank needs to be specific to the fish's needs. Some fish prefer sand over gravel, some need hiding spaces... If you already have fish or animals in your tank, will they get along with the fish you're going to buy? Some fish fight ferociously and can rip each other apart. Choose wisely and not out of impulse; you can always come back to the pet store after researching and modifying your tank., When you take your new friend home, it's tempting to immediately dump the fish into your newly cycled, already furnished tank. However, even though you think your fish is suffering in that tiny plastic bag, it will suffer more if you just throw it in the tank. Oftentimes, your tank water temperature is very different from the one the fish is in. The salinity (in the case of salt and brackish water) and water parameters may be different. Acclimating means getting your fish used to the changes so it won't go into shock.

Float the bag in your tank for fifteen minutes for the temperature in the bag to slowly match the tank.
Dump out 25% of the water in the bag and add the same volume of tank water. Wait for five minutes.
Take out 25% again and put in the same volume of tank water. Wait for five more minutes. Then, scoop out your fish carefully (but not the water in the bag) and quickly place it in your tank.
Some people also keep the new fish in a quarantine tank for the first weeks or so to make sure they don't have diseases. This is optional, but a good option for those who aren't willing to risk infecting their entire 300 gallon tank.

, Depending on the size of the tank, some people change weekly and some monthly. Either way, changing water gets rid of nitrates, which in high levels can harm fish and good bacteria. 25% water volume is what most people change out. Topping off the tank with new water can be done whenever necessary (saltwater tanks should top off with freshwater most often, as salt does not evaporate).

Before adding new water, it should be set out in room temperature for at least 24 hours. This won't evaporate all chlorine, and definitely won't change chloramines and heavy metals, but will get rid of some dissolved gases. Make sure you add a water conditioner and anything else necessary for your type of tank.

, For all animals (and plants if you want) count them carefully. Especially in a large tank with many fish, one dead or missing fish can go unnoticed until the owner investigates to find out the cause of an ammonia spike when testing the water. Also, check out the condition of all your fish. If you see one with sickness, quarantine it so you won't infect any more fish. Infections and sicknesses are usually easily treatable if you get to them quickly (you'll be quick if you have prepared your first-aid kit!)., A lot of people don't clean their tanks for some time, and that's usually okay. Twice a year cleaning is common. For small tanks, though, it might get dirty easily. Algae can be left on the glass unless it is overgrown/blocking out light or your view.

Never use bleach or soap to clean the tank. Use cleaning tools you have set aside for fish purposes only.

, A handful of fish food (unless you have a pond or a really big tank) is way too much and wasteful. For most fish, a pinch of food two times a day is enough. To prevent constipation, skipping a feeding day is fine. However, skipping more than a few days is not okay, so you'll need a vacation block, automatic feeder, or someone else to feed for you., Ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite are important to test for. Write down your findings so that you have a record for future reference. Ammonia and nitrites are very important to monitor; fish can stand higher levels of nitrates. Near 0 ppm of ammonia and nitrites are recommended, and no more than 20 ppm of nitrates. Fish can develop open sores, red gills, and have trouble breathing in water with high levels of these.

Saltwater tanks, especially those with corals and live rocks, should be tested more frequently -- including tests for pH and salinity.

, Many fish are curious and will soon get to know your face and will swim towards you. Some pet owners know their fish well enough that the fish will enjoy being petted, going toward the tail, if you're careful about rubbing off their slime coat."

Check for small white spots on your goldfish.,
Note if your goldfish is brushing against objects or the sides of the tank.,
Look at your goldfish’s gills.",How to Cure Goldfish Ich1," Ich parasites may not be very visible when they first start to form. But once they start to feed on the bodily fluids of your fish’s skin and fins, they will encyst themselves and show up as small flecks or white spots. It may look that your goldfish has been dusted with salt or sugar, but in fact, they are suffering from ich.If you don’t notice the ich treatment early, it may develop into large white patches on your fish’s scales and fins. This is a sign more ich parasites have attached to your goldfish.;
, The goldfish ich will cause your goldfish to, well, itch! He may brush his body against objects in the tank or against the sides of the tank in an effort to stop the itch., Because your goldfish is under distress, he may not be getting enough oxygen in the tank. This will cause his gills to go into overdrive and lead to heavy and rapid movement of his gills as he tries to breath."

Address the underlying conditions.",How to Identify Finrot," Fin rot usually affects a fish’s tail fin, but can also affect other fins, such as the dorsal and pectoral fins.In the early stages of fin rot, the edge of the fin will look ragged or shredded, due to the breakdown of the fin’s protective membrane.As the disease progresses, an increasing amount of the fin will be destroyed. As more of the fin erodes away, the fin may start to resemble a semicircular bite shape.If fin rot becomes severe, the fin will erode to the point of being only a stump.A hole in the affected fin usually indicates a fungal infection, which sometimes occurs simultaneously with fin rot.Be aware that you may not be able to detect fin rot until the disease is fairly advanced.;
, Fins affected by fin rot become discolored. If your fish has fin rot, the edges of his fins will have an uneven, fuzzy white lining—this is a very common sign of fin rot.His fins will also develop red streaks from inflammation and bleeding.The affected areas may also have white dots,which could be indicative of a fungal infection.

, In its most severe stages, fin rot can affect other parts of your fish’s body. For example, your fish may develop abdominal swelling.You may also notice ulcers and lesions on different parts of your fish’s body.Fin rot is a bacterial disease. When the fins become damaged, the bacteria can enter the bloodstream through the damaged area and spread the disease throughout your fish’s body., Although the physical appearance of the fins is the easiest way to identify fin rot, your fish’s behavior can also give you important clues. He may become listless. He may also start rubbing against the tank’s walls or on the tank’s decorations to try to relieve his discomfort—this could actually make the disease worse by further damaging his fins.These behaviors are not specific to fin rot, but can help confirm the diagnosis if his fin damage is characteristic of this disease.

, Fin rot is caused by opportunistic bacteria (Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Flexibacter).Opportunistic bacteria are usually harmless, but can cause disease under certain conditions. The opportunistic bacteria are likely already in your fish’s tank,but will not cause disease when your fish is healthy and his tank's water quality is good.


Other bacteria linked to fin rot are Pseudomonas species and myxobacteria.

, Opportunistic bacteria will cause disease in your fish when some underlying condition weakens his body's defenses. Poor water quality is the most common underlying condition with fin rot.For example, ammonia accumulation in your fish's tank can damage his fins, creating an entry point for the bacteriaNitrate—what ammonia is broken down to during the nitrogen cycle—can also accumulate in the tank and damage your fish's fins.Decaying live plants and leftover food can increase ammonia and nitrate levels., Stress is another common underlying condition. It weakens your fish’s immune system, which reduces his ability to fight off infection.Your fish can become stressed for a number of reasons, including bullying by other fish, overcrowding, and improper human handling.Water that is too cold, as well as water pH fluctuations, can also be stressful to your fish., Physical damage is another underlying condition of fin rot. Bodily wounds create entry points for opportunistic bacteria to enter your fish's body and case disease. Fighting and fin nipping commonly result in physical damage.If you have a burrowing fish, he could easily damage his tail and fin if the bottom of his tank contains gravel instead of sand., This is relevant if you have multiple fish in one tank. Isolating the sick fish will prevent him from transmitting disease to the healthy fish. To prevent possible ammonia and nitrate accumulation, do not put substrate or live plants in the treatment tank.Use a sponge filter in the treatment tank. It is less likely than a chemical filter to filter out medications, and is unlikely to stress your fish (like a strong power filter).Place an enclosed water heater in the tank to maintain a water temperature that is recommended for your specific type of fish.An air stone will help keep the tank well oxygenated.The supplies for your treatment tank are available at your local pet store.
Continue to monitor the other fish for signs for fin rot.Separate and treat them if necessary.

, In the United States, over-the-counter antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, trimethoprim, and sulfadimidine) are used to treat fin rot.The antibiotic is typically added directly to the tank’s water. Carefully follow the medication’s instructions to ensure effective treatment.


Outside of the United States, you may have to obtain the antibiotics through your veterinarian.It is common to use a combination of antibiotics to treat fin rot, since the disease could be caused by several types of bacteria.Methylene blue is a non-antibiotic treatment that can also be used to treat fin rot.

, Depending on the severity of fin rot, fin rot can also be treated by trimming the affected fins to remove the damaged tissue. This medical procedure requires that your fish be sedated, so you will need to schedule an appointment with your veterinarian to have this done.Your veterinarian will use sterile scissors to remove the damaged tissue. He or she will then treat the clean edge with antiseptic. Your fish may need additional treatment if fin rot has become extensive.The fin tissue is more likely to grow back with minor cases of fin rot., Your fish should remain in the treatment tank until his clinical signs have improved. A good rule of thumb is to keep him isolated for about 10 days.During this time, look for improvement in clinical signs: normal color returning to his fins, healing of ulcers and lesions on his body, normal swimming behavior.


Be mindful that the fin rot may be too severe for treatment.

, Effective treatment of fin rot involves both medical treatment and improvement of underlying conditions. Improving water quality is extremely important. Change the water to remove excess ammonia and nitrate from the tank and add fresh minerals to the tank.If need be, change the filter and allow time for bacteria to grow that will help reduce ammonia levels in the tank.Remove any dead plants to reduce ammonia accumulation.
Reduce the stress in your fish's life by keeping him in his own tank, away from the other aggressive fish. You could also use a water heater and thermometer to keep his tank at the right temperature.
Remove sharp objects from your fish's tank (e.g. gravel, sharp-edged decorations) to prevent further physical damage.

Think about recent changes to your fish’s aquarium or routine.,
Quarantine your fish.,
Treat your fish.,
Return your fish to his aquarium.",How to Identify Aquarium Fish Diseases," How your fish is breathing and moving around in the aquarium can let you know if he is sick. For example, your fish may be swimming less. Some diseases could prevent your fish from being able to swim at all.You may also see your fish rubbing up against objects in the aquarium. This is called ‘flashing’ or ‘glancing,’ and is often associated with external parasites.If you observe your fish moving his fins rapidly but not actually going anywhere, he may be suffering from gill disease. With gill disease, he may also lie listless at the bottom of the aquarium.Labored breathing is another common sign of illness in aquarium fish.;
, Aquarium fish diseases can cause visible abnormalities on your fish’s body. Areas to pay close attention to include your fish’s eyes, fins, and swim bladder.


If your fish has ‘Pop-eye,’ his eyes become so large that it looks like they will pop out of his head. This may be caused by bacteria or too much oxygen in the water.Fin rot is a disease in which your fish’s fins turn opaque and begin to erode. This disease can be fatal if the fins erode down to the base of the fin—this would prevent your fish from being able to move.Your fish’s swim bladder, which is located above the stomach, can become swollen if he has swim bladder disease.Since a normally functioning swim bladder provides buoyancy, a swollen swim bladder would prevent your fish from being able to swim or float.If you look closely enough, you may be able to see small parasites, such as white lice, hanging on to your fish’s body. These parasites cause extreme irritation, leading your fish to ‘flash’ or ‘glance’ to try to remove the parasite. Sores will develop because of this rubbing., Mucus can be a sign of fungal or bacterial disease. Ich, also known as White Spot Disease, is a fungal disease that produces mucus on a fish’s gills and body.It is caused by a pathogen called Ichthyophthirius multifiliis . The mucus functions to repel the pathogen from the skin.Ich is one of the most common aquarium fish diseases and can be very contagious.Other fungal diseases, such as Mouth Fungus and Body Fungus, can cause white patches of mucus to develop on your fish’s body.Columnaris disease is a bacterial disease that can produce a grayish-white film on your fish’s body. You may also see yellow or gray patches on his gills., Parasites, bacteria, or fungi commonly cause aquarium fish diseases. However, the presence of these pathogens in your fish’s aquarium does not automatically mean your fish will become ill. Often, the underlying culprit in aquarium fish diseases is poor water quality.Checking the water quality is the first thing you should if you notice your fish looking unwell.Testing kits are available that test pH and levels of water hardness, nitrate, nitrate, and ammonia.Poor water quality can increase the concentration of pathogens in the tank to a level that would make your fish sick.Different species fish can have different water quality requirements. Consult with your veterinarian or the staff at your local pet store for more specific guidance on water quality.

, When you notice that your fish is unwell, try to recall any changes that you may have made to the aquarium or his normal routine. Sometimes, the changes themselves can cause stress, which can leave your fish more susceptible to illness.


For example, ask yourself if you have added new fish to the aquarium, or changed out any of the water quality equipment.If you have added a new fish, remember whether you quarantined the new fish before adding it to the tank.A new fish that is sick may expose your other fish to disease.
You should also ask yourself if you have recently changed your fish’s diet.Also, try to remember if you sprayed on perfume or insect repellant near your fish’s aquarium. The chemicals from these substances may have gotten into your fish’s tank and affected the water quality., It is a good idea to treat your fish in a separate aquarium.To reduce your fish’s stress of moving from one tank to the other, keep the water conditions in the quarantine aquarium as close to the conditions in the original tank. Also, place some plastic plants in the new aquarium to help your fish feel more comfortable.Use a water heater to ensure the water temperature does not fall below 75 degrees Fahrenheit.Consider using a non-chemical filter, such as a sponge filter. Chemical filters may filter out the medication you apply to the water. Also, avoid using a strong power filter—it may cause a water disturbance that could further distress your sick fish.Place an air stone in the tank to provide oxygen. Some medications may remove oxygen from the water, which could stress your fish.Use a net to move your fish from one tank to the other.
It is recommended to quarantine your fish for at least 10 days while you are treating him., Medicated foods and treatments added directly to the water are the most common ways to treat sick aquarium fish. Many antibiotics, anti-fungal, and anti-parasitic medications are available to treat your sick fish. In addition, substances such as copper, formalin, and malachite green can be effective as treatments.At your local pet store, you will see a variety of commercial fish medications. However, they may not have been tested for safety and efficacy.Talk with your veterinarian or a fish expert for recommendations on reputable fish medications.
Whichever medication is recommended for your fish’s disease, follow the instructions carefully to ensure you are treating your fish correctly and effectively.

, After your fish has been cleared of his disease, you can place him back in his original aquarium. If you have multiple sick fish to treat, disinfect the aquarium by adding 5% hydrochloric acid to the aquarium.Let the disinfecting agents stand in the water for several days, then clean it and add another sponge filter.Products to clean the quarantine aquarium are available at your local pet store.
Consult with the staff at your local pet store or your local water safety department about safe ways to dispose of the treated water.

Buy plants only from tanks without fish.",How to Treat Tropical Fish with White Spot Disease (Ich)," The disease works in the same way for both freshwater and saltwater fish but have different life cycle durations and different cures. In both types of water, the protozoan parasite attaches itself to fish in order to carry out its life cycle. In the wild, ich is less of a problem as few parasites are ever able to find a host. When they do, the parasites eventually fall off of the fish and the fish is able to swim away and heals its wounds. However, in an enclosed tank, ich parasites can easily attach itself to fish, multiplying and infesting, which eventually leads to the decimation of an entire tankful of fish.


In freshwater, ich is known as ichthyophthiriasis. In saltwater, ich is known as cryptocaryon irritans and is often confused with other parasites that produce white spots. Saltwater ich can take longer than freshwater ich to replicate but only have 12 to 18 hours to find a host before they die as opposed to freshwater ich which can last up to 48 hours without a host.;
, Since ich is fairly common, most fish have developed a good immunity against it. However, stress can suppress the immune system of a fish and that's when ich is most prevalent. Stress can be caused by:


Incorrect water temperatures and bad water quality.
Other tank inhabitants.
New tank inhabitants.
An improper diet.
Shipping and handling of fish during transport
Your own home environment, especially if your home is prone to loud noises, banging or shaking doors, or have a lot of traffic around the tank.

, Symptoms of ich can be seen on your fish as well as in the way your fish behaves. The most obvious sign of ich is the appearance of little white dots that resemble grains of salt which gave the disease its name.The common signs and symptoms of ich are:


White spots on the body and gills of fish. The spots may even join together to form white patches. Sometimes, the ich is only found on the fish's gills.
Excessive flashing. Your fish may excessively rub against plants or rocks in the tank in attempt to get rid of the parasites or because the disease is causing the fish irritation.
Clamped fins. This means your fish constantly folds its fins against its body instead of letting them fan out and rest freely by its sides.Laboured breathing. If your fish is gasping at the surface of the water or hovering near the tank's filter, it's probably suffering from a lack of oxygen. The ich on its gills makes it difficult for your fish to absorb oxygen from the water.
Loss of appetite. If you fish is not eating or spitting back out its food, this may be a sign of stress and disease.
Reclusive behaviour. Animals often hide when they're feeling ill and any change in normal behaviour is often a sign of stress or disease. Your fish might hide out in the decor or not be as active as usual.

, Ich can only be killed when it is not attached to the fish which is when the fully matured parasite drops off of the fish's skin in order to replicate itself into more ich-infecting units. Anytime the parasite is attached to the fish, it is protected from chemicals and treatment is not effective. There are several stages to the ich life cycle:



Trophont stage: This is when the ich parasite is visible on your fish. It burrows under your fish's mucus coating forming a cyst which protects it from chemicals so that any treatment becomes ineffective. In a typical tank with a temperature of 75 to 80ºF (24 to 27ºC), the trophont stage or feeding stage will last a few days before the fully developed cyst drops off the fish.

Tomont or tomite stage: At this stage, treatment of ich is possible. The parasite or tomont will float for several hours in the water until it attaches itself on a plant or some other surface. Once attached, it begins to divide or replicate rapidly inside the cyst. In a few days, it will burst open and new organisms will start swimming out in search of a new host. Freshwater tomont can replicate as fast as 8 hours while saltwater tomont may take up to 3 to 28 days to replicate.

Thermonts or swarmer stage: Freshwater swarmers must find a host or fish within a 48 hours or it will die while saltwater swarmers only have 12 to 18 hours. For this reason, one way to ensure a tank is clear of ich is to leave it uninhabited for a week or two.

, Higher temperatures speed up the life cycle the parasite. A tank with a higher temperature will take a couple of days for the cycle to complete while one with a lower temperature may take weeks to complete.


Never increase the temperature of your tank drastically. This can stress your fish and some fish do not tolerate higher temperatures.
Most tropical fish are can withstand temperatures as high as 86ºF (30ºC). Always consult your tropical fish expert or learn about your fish to find out what temperatures they can tolerate.

, Slowly increase the temperature by 2ºF (1ºC) per hour until it reaches the correct temperature. And maintain this temperature for at least 10 days. High temperatures speed up the life cycle of ich and can also prevent tomont from replicating.


Make sure that the other fish in the tank can handle the higher temperatures beforehand.
If your fish can handle temperatures higher than 86ºF (30ºC), raise the temperature to 89ºF (32ºC) for 3 to 4 days and then decrease it back to 86ºF (30ºC) for another 10 days.
Be sure your tank has enough oxygen or aeration as water holds less oxygen at higher temperatures.
At the same time, you can treat the water with salt or medicine everyday.
Always be sure your fish can handle a rise in temperature. Observe how your fish react to a slowly heating tank or read up on how high of a temperature your fish can tolerate.

, Since ich inhibits a fish's ability to breathe and absorb oxygen, increasing aeration can help boost your fish's immune system and also save it from suffocating to death. There are several ways to increase oxygen in your tank:


Decrease the water level so that when your filtered water hits the surface, it creates more oxygen.
Place more airstones in the tank or move them closer to the surface of the water.
Use bubble disks to create bigger bubble streams.Use powerheads to not only increase oxygen but also improve water movement in the tank., Dissolve 1 teaspoon per 1 gallon (4 L) of water in a small amount of tank water separately and then add the mixture to the tank. Leave the salt in the freshwater aquarium for 10 days. Salt disrupts the fluid regulation of ich and also helps develop your fish's natural mucous or slime coats to protect it from ich parasites. Combine salt with heat to further effectively kill off ich.


Use aquarium salt that is specifically design for fish and not table salt which is not iodine-free.
Never use medication along with salt and heat as the salt and medication can react and restrict oxygen within the tank.
Change 25% of the tank water every few days and only add the correct amount of salt to water taken out. However, if the treatment is over, do partial water changes but don't add anymore salt.

, Partially changing the water everyday can help remove some trophonts and tomites from the tank and also add oxygen to the water. Be sure to use treated water so the extra chlorine won't stress your fish or agitate your fish's wounds.


If water changes stress your fish, decrease the amount of water or frequency that you change.

, There are many products available at your local pet store that can help treat ich. Always follow the instructions labelled on the medication for the correct dosage amounts and if it's safe to use on your type of fish, especially if you have invertebrate fish such as snails, shrimp, and clams.


Always perform a water change and vacuum your gravel before you administer the medicine. Medicine is more effective in a clean tank without other dissolved organics or nitrates to get in the way.
Always remove the carbon from your filter as the carbon can neutralize or entrap medicines added to the tank.

, Since saltwater ich lasts much longer in their tomite phase, copper is often added to the tank for 14 to 25 days and works similarly as salt to destroy ich. However, using copper requires you to put in the exact and correct dosage and diligently check copper levels in your tank daily with a copper ion test kit. Do not use copper to treat freshwater fish because it could kill them.Always follow the instructions on the product.
Remove the carbon from your filter as the carbon can neutralize or entrap medicines added to the tank.
Copper combines with calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate based rocks, sand, and gravel so be sure to only use copper in a bare tank.
Copper is highly toxic for invertebrates, reefs, and plants. Separate invertebrates, reefs, and plants and treat them with other safe methods.

, These methods can be dubbed as dangerous alternatives to treating ich. Some even damage your fish and must be constantly monitored so levels don't reach to a point where your fish might die from the chemical. Always read the label of these chemical medicines and wear protective clothes like gloves and goggles when handling them. Some treatments are:



Malachite green: Similar to chemotherapy in humans, malachite green works to damage all cell's ability to produce energy which is vital for metabolic processes. This chemical doesn't differentiate from a fish's cell to the cell of an ich parasite.

Formalin: Formalin kills microorganisms by reacting with a cell's proteins and nucleic acids which alter the cell's function and structure and often used to preserve biological specimens. It can damage your filter system, deplete oxygen levels and kill invertebrates or weaker fish.

, Before purchasing your tank inhabitants, it's always best to observe every fish in the store for signs of disease. Even if the fish you want doesn't seem to show signs of ich, it is still exposed to and may carry on ich into your aquarium at home.


Some fish have very good immune systems and may just act as carriers to the disease. By introducing a carrier to ich, you are exposing your resident or current tank inhabitants to ich who may or may not have similarly strong immune systems as your new fish.

, Set up a separate smaller tank so you can observe your new fish for signs of disease. If there are any diseases present, treatment will be much easier but always do the full treatment dosage amounts. Don't think that a small tanks means you only need to do a reduced amount of treatment.


When you add new fish to a quarantine tank or any tank, never add the water it was previously in into your aquarium. This reduces the likelihood of transferring tomites into your tank.

, This prevents the introduction of diseases to other tanks. Similarly, use different sponges and other cleaning tools for each tank.


If you can't afford multiple nets, sponges, and cleaning tools, allow for each item to completely dry before using it on another tank. Ich cannot survive in a dry environment.

, Plants in tanks with fish carry more diseases than those grown and sold separately. Alternatively, you can quarantine tanks for 10 days without fish and treat them with ich treatments to be sure that it isn't infected.

Raise the temperature of your aquarium water to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius).,
Keep the oxygen levels high in the water.,
Add salt to the water.,
Maintain the high water temperature and change the water every couple of days.,
Reduce the water temperature until it’s back to 65 degrees F (18 degrees C).",How to Cure Goldfish Ich2," Increase the water temperature slowly over a 48 hour period in small increments of 2 degrees F or 1 degree C every hour. This will give your goldfish time to adjust to the rising temperature and prevent shocking him.The heat will prevent the ich from developing into many more parasites after it detaches from your fish. High temperatures will effectively neutralize the parasites and stop them from reproducing.Do not combine two ich treatments, only do one ich treatment at a time.

, You will need to compensate for raising the water temperature by providing more oxygen in the water for your fish. Do this by:Reducing the water level in the tank.
Aiming power heads at the surface of the tank water.
Placing extra air stones, or ornaments embedded with air stones, into the tank water.

, Some aquarium owners argue that raising the temperature of the water in increments is enough to detach and kill the ich. But a salt bath can help your fish develop his slime coat, which will prevent the ich from reattaching to him. The combination of salt and heat will attack any free-swimming ich in the tank until they are all killed off.Use aquarium salt that is made specifically for freshwater fish, not table salt. You can purchase aquarium salt online or at your local pet store.
Add one tablespoon or three teaspoons of aquarium salt for every five gallons (19 liters) of tank water. If you want to try using less aquarium salt, you can try one teaspoon per gallon of water instead.
If you have other fish or invertebrates in the tank with the infected goldfish, ensure they are not sensitive to salt before adding salt to the water. Some fish cannot handle large doses of salt.

, Keep the temperature steady at 86 degrees F (30 degrees C) for 10 days.At the beginning of the treatment, when the ich symptoms are very visible on your fish, change 25 percent of the water every two days. This will ensure the water is well oxygenated and help to get rid of any excess parasites. Add the appropriate dose of aquarium salt after each water change.Over 10 days, the signs of ich should decrease on your fish and the tank water will slowly be cleaned of the ich. Continue to maintain the high temperature and add the doses of aquarium salt three to five days after the last signs of ich are gone to ensure all the parasites have been killed.

, After 15 days of the natural treatment, your goldfish should be swimming normally and white spot free in the tank. It’s now time to bring the water temperature back down to its normal temperature in increments of 2 degrees F (1 degree C) every hour over 48 hours.Do one last 25 percent water change at the end of the natural treatment and then continue your normal weekly water changes.

Change 25 percent of the tank water and remove any waste in the tank.,
Raise the temperature of your aquarium water to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius).,
Use ich medication.,
Add salt to the tank water.,
Wait a couple of weeks for the ich to disappear.,
Reduce the water temperature until it’s back to 65 degrees F (18 degrees C).",How to Cure Goldfish Ich3," Use a water siphon to vacuum the gravel. Then, remove any active carbon for your water filter. Lowering the water level will increase surface agitation of the water and help to circulate the ich medication when you add it to the water.You should also check to make sure the water filter in the tank is pushing a strong, steady flow of water into the tank.

, Increase the water temperature slowly over a 48 hour period in small increments of 2 degrees F or 1 degree C every hour. This will give your goldfish time to adjust to the rising temperature and prevent shocking him.Unlike the natural treatment, the purpose of raising the water temperature is not to kill the ich with heat, but to speed up the life cycle of the ich. You are trying to force each parasite to develop into the free-swimming stage very quickly so the ich medication can kill them, without harming your fish.

, There are several commercial ich treatments available online or at your local pet store. Some ich medications are copper-based, so they will not stain like some other medications. However, copper-based ich can be harmful to other invertebrates or plants in the infected aquarium. Always read the label of the medication to ensure it will not harm your other aquarium pets.Follow the dosage instructions on the label to apply the ich medication to the tank water.

, If you would like to also add salt to the water to boost your goldfish’s slime coat and speed up the killing of the ich, you can do so after you put in the ich medication.Make sure the other fish and invertebrates in the tank are not sensitive to salt treatments. If you are concerned the salt any harm the other fish in the tank, don’t use it. Stick to just the ich medication.

, It may take some time for the ich medication to rid the tank of ich, as each ich parasite needs to be in the free-swimming stage before it can be killed. After a couple of weeks, the white spots on your fish should be gone and the tank should be ich free., After a couple of weeks of the professional treatment, your goldfish should be swimming normally and white spot free in the tank. It’s now time to bring the water temperature back down to its normal temperature in increments of 2 degrees F (1 degree C) every hour over 48 hours.Do one last 25 percent water change at the end of the natural treatment and then continue your normal weekly water changes.

Take the affected fish out of the tank.,
Wash the tank and all the tank accessories.,
Do a 100% water change.,
Check the pH of the tank water.,
Use antibacterial fin rot treatment.,
Try tea tree oil and salt.,
Use an air pump or an airstone when you put medication into the tank.,
Keep the tank clean and change the water once a week.,
Make sure the tank is not overcrowded.,
Give your fish high quality food.",How to Treat Fin Rot," Start by removing the affected fish from the tank and placing him in a separate tank with clean, fresh unchlorinated water.You will also need to remove the other fish in the tank to a separate container with clean, fresh unchlorinated water. Use a different net to remove the other fish as fish rot can be spread through shared nets. Do not place the affected fish in the same container as the other fish as this can cause the fin rot to spread.;
, You will then need to drain the tank of all the water in the sink. Take out all the tank accessories as well as the gravel in the tank.Give the tank a good wash with hot water. Do not use soap when you clean the tank. Use paper towels to get into the crevices of the tank and make sure it has been cleaned thoroughly.
Soak the tank accessories in hot water for five to ten minutes. If you have live plants, soak them in lukewarm water. You can then take them out of the water and let them air dry.
Wash the gravel with warm water and hoover it with a small vacuum to get rid of any dirt or debris.

, Once you have washed the tank thoroughly and let it air dry, you can place the gravel and the tank accessories back into the tank. If your tank is uncycled, do a 100% water change using dechlorinated or conditioned water. Make sure the water is at 80-82 degrees F (26-27 degrees C).If your tank is cycled, meaning there is an established colony of beneficial bacteria built up on the submerged surfaces of the tank (accumulated mainly through fish living in the tank and excreting nitrogen), you can do a 50% water change; subsequent smaller proportion water changes are recommended.If your tank has a water filter, you should take a bucket of the fresh tank water and wash the filter with the water. Once the filter is cleaned of any gunk or dirt, you can place it in the tank. Do not use tap water to clean the filter as this can contaminate the filter.

, Before you put your fish back in the tank, you should use a pH test kit to ensure the water quality is good. The pH should be around 7-8 and the ammonia, zero nitrites and nitrates should be no higher than 40 ppm.Once you have confirmed the water is suitable for your fish, you can slowly add the fish back into the tank, including the fish with fin rot. You may then add antibiotics or antifungal medication to the tank water to help kill the fin rot. The combination of a clean tank and medication should help your fish to get rid of the fin rot.

, If your fish’s fin rot does not improve within a few days of cleaning and treating the tank, you may want to try antibacterial fin rot treatment. You can find this medication over the counter at your local pet store. Look for fin rot medication that is made for your type of fish, such as fin rot medication for a Betta fish or a goldfish. Follow the dosage directions on the label.These medications often contain antibiotics to kill off the fungal infection, such as erythromycin, minocycline, trimethoprim and sulfadimidine. Make sure the fin rot treatment does not contain any organic dyes, as they can be toxic to certain fish.
Popular types of fin rot treatment include Jungle Fungus Eliminator and Tetracycline. You can also use brands like Maracyn, Maracyn II, Waterlife- Myxazin, and MelaFix., An alternative to commercial medication is the use of tea tree oil and salt. However, tea tree oil is not considered a reliable treatment and should be used as a preventative measure rather than a cure. You may need to supplement the tea tree oil treatment with antibacterial medication or antibiotics.You can add a one to two drops of tea tree oil to the tank water to keep the water clean and sterile. Make sure your fish do not react negatively to the tea tree oil before you add more to the tank the following day.
Tonic salt, or sodium chloride, can also be used to prevent fin rot. Add 1 ounce salt per gallon of tank water. Only use tonic salt on salt-tolerant freshwater fish.

, When you treat your sick fish with medication, you should supply extra oxygen so your fish can breath. Medications tend to leech oxygen from the tank water so you will need to give your fish some supplemental oxygen to keep him healthy. Set up an air pump, an airstone, or aquarium housing in your tank to inject more oxygen into the water.If your fish is a Betta, set the air pump on low so the current is not too high, as a high current can be stressful for Betta fish.
You should only use the medication for the duration of time specified on the label. Medication can be stressful for fish and should only be used on a by need basis.

, A clean tank will ensure your fish recovers properly from fin rot and prevent the development of fin rot in the future. Get into the habit of cleaning the tank regularly.If you have a one gallon tank, you should change the water every three days. A 2.5 gallon tank should be changed every four to five days and a 5 gallon tank should be changed every seven days.If your tank is uncycled, you should do a 100% water change every time you clean the tank. Wash all the tank accessories and the gravel as well.
Add aquarium salt to the water after every cleaning to keep the tank water healthy and monitor the pH of the tank so it is comfortable for your fish.

, Though it may be tempting to fill your tank with lots of fish, overcrowding can lead to high stress levels and a higher risk of disease for your fish. Make sure your fish are compatible with each other and have more than enough room to swim around and interact in a healthy way.If you start to notice that certain fish are nipping or biting at each other, this may be a sign that your tank is overcrowded. You may need to remove several fish from the tank or isolate one fish who seems to be acting aggressive towards the other fish.
Certain fish are known to be fin nippers, including tiger barbs, serpae tetras, and black widow tetras. Angelfish and catfish can be fin nippers as well as pufferfish and targetfish. If you have any of these fish in your tank, keep an eye on them and separate them from other more vulnerable fish, like guppies., Try to give your fish a varied diet of high quality food and stick to a consistent feeding schedule. Overfeeding and underfeeding your fish can lead to a poor immune system and put your fish at a higher risk of diseases.Giving your fish too much food can also introduce too much bacteria into the tank, as uneaten food will float around in the water and increase the concentration of bacteria in the tank.

Return the goldfish to its home tank.",How to Cure Goldfish Dropsy," Dropsy is a build-up of fluids inside the goldfish. Thus, the first signs of dropsy will be general bloating.Look for any unusual increase in size of the goldfish.
Treating the goldfish at this early stage presents the best chance of saving the goldfish.;
, Beyond the initial bloating, fluid build-up begins at the goldfish’s head. As fluid builds up under the goldfish’s eyes, they will start to bulge out., This is the classic symptom of dropsy. As fluid build up moves down the goldfish’s body, its scales will start to rise up from its body. When the fluid build-up has progressed through the goldfish’s whole body, it will look like an opened pinecone.Pearlscale goldfish are sometimes mistakenly diagnosed with dropsy because their scales naturally have a raised bump in the middle. A Pearlscale goldfish likely only has dropsy if its scales are far more raised than usual.
Once a goldfish has reached this change it is usually not savable. However, it doesn’t hurt to treat the symptoms and try to cure the underlying disease.

, Dropsy—and its underlying causes—are not contagious. However, the conditions a goldfish needs to recover from dropsy are different than the normal ideal conditions of an aquarium. A second tank of similar size can serve as the goldfish’s sickbay.Perfect conditions must be maintained for the goldfish’s immune system to have the best chance to recover.

, The water should start out at the same temperature as the water in the goldfish’s original tank. This will prevent the goldfish from going into shock in its new environment., The ideal water temperature for a goldfish with dropsy is 80 degrees Fahrenheit. A relatively high water temperature will prevent bacteria from multiplying.


Raise the temperature in the tank by a two degrees every hour until it reaches 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
Use an adjustable aquarium heater so you control the rate of temperature increase., The kidney’s function is to keep the fish’s internal salt levels balanced with the salt levels in the water. When the kidneys shut down, salt builds up in the goldfish. Increasing the salinity of the tank helps the goldfish to stay in equilibrium with its environment—which will boost the goldfish’s immune system.Add one teaspoon of salt per gallon of water.
Don’t add too much salt. A high level of salinity will put even more stress on the goldfish’s kidneys.

, The goal is to keep the goldfish in perfect, clean conditions while it recovers from dropsy. Changing the water on a regular basis will help achieve this goal.Aim to change the water once every three days.
Remember to slowly increase the temperature and add salt to the new water.

, Dropsy is a symptom of many goldfish diseases. It can be caused by bacterial infections, parasitical infections, toxins, and kidney cysts. There is no way to know the cause of a particular goldfish’s dropsy. Only the first two causes—bacterial infections and parasitical infections—can be treated.Since there’s no way to know the cause of dropsy, it makes sense to provide all available treatments.

, There are two antibiotic treatments available for treating bacterial infections in goldfish—Kanaplex and Kanamycin. They each target different bacteria, so its important to start with one, check for improvement, and move onto the other.Add thirty-six milligrams of Kanaplex per gallon of water to the tank. Continue the treatment for seven days. Watch the goldfish for signs of improvement such as decreased bloating, more active swimming, and increase eating. If you don’t notice any improvement, move on to Kanamycin.Add two-hundred milligrams of Kanamycin per gallon of water to the tank. Continue the treatment for seven days and watch for improvement.You can purchase Kanaplex and Kanamycin at any pet store that sells fish. If you don’t have a pet store nearby, both antibiotics are available online.

, There is no well-established treatment for parasitical infections. However, liquid praziquantel has shown some promise. In any case, it won’t hurt to try.Shake the bottle of liquid praziquantel vigorously. Add two-hundred milligrams of praziquantel per gallon to the tank. Continue the treatment for seven days and watch for improvement.Praziquantel is available at most pet stores that sell fish. It’s also available at online retailers.

, If the goldfish has become more active and less bloated, wait three weeks to ensure the change represents real recovery from dropsy. If the positive change continues, it’s time to return the goldfish to its home tank., Over the course of three water changes—approximately nine days—reduce the water salinity by 1/3 of a teaspoon. At the third water change, do not add any salt., Over a period of hours, reduce the water in the isolation tank to the temperature in the tank where the goldfish will be returned. This will acclimate the goldfish to the new temperature so it doesn’t go into shock., To help prevent future outbreaks of dropsy, perform regular water changes and ensure that the water temperature does not fluctuate more than a few degrees during the day."

Acclimate your cichlids to your tank.,
Watch them closely.",How to Keep German Blue Ram Cichlids1," If you are unfamiliar with the details of the breed, do some research online by typing “German Blue Ram Cichlids” into a search engine. You will see a number of aquarium center websites and hobbyist blogs describing the detailed characteristics of Rams. They are an Amazonian fish, so many of the sites might describe how to create an “Amazon” freshwater tank.Blue Rams grow to an adult size of 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) and have a life expectancy of between 3-4 years. This means that you should consider these fish as an extended commitment of care.
The males of the species can be identified by their more pronounced dorsal fine. The females have additional coloring on the ‘false eye’ mid-body. Females are usually also slightly smaller.;
, Make sure to buy or ‘adopt’ your Blue Rams from a reputable online or brick-and-mortar fish dealer. Choose a store that you have worked with before or that you’ve researched online. If you have friend who also has a tank, ask for their advice regarding good places to purchase.


Some fish dealers breed Blue Rams en masse for sale purposes. These fish are heavily treated with hormones, making them less suitable for breeding and lowering their life span. Be wary of ‘cheap’ Blue Rams. The breed was introduced in 2009, so they should still be relatively expensive., Before you put your Blue Rams in your tank, you must prepare the water. Blue Rams are especially picky about water parameters. Place your tank under a faucet, or use a small bucket, and fill with room temperature water. Then, get out your water conditioner and squeeze a few drops into the tank. This will make the tap water safe for your Blue Rams.After you've treated the water, let your tank sit for one full day before introducing your Blue Rams.

, Place your Blue Rams in their plastic bag directly in the water at the top of your aquarium. Let them sit in the bag for 15-30 minutes. When this time is up, open the top of the bag just a bit. Let a little tank water into the bag. Repeat this process every 3-5 minutes for another half-hour. Then, open the bag fully, net your cichlids and place them in the tank., For the first twenty-four hours especially, keep a close eye on your new additions. Observe how they interact with the other fish. Try to see if they experience any difficulties navigating amongst the plant life. Monitor their physical behaviors and appearance. If one of your cichlids appears listless or sickly, remove it quickly as it may spread infection to the rest of the tank."
"
Select the proper tank size.,
Install the proper heater, hood, and light.,
Add substrate.,
Provide ample and appropriate tank decorations.",How to Keep German Blue Ram Cichlids2," A pair of Blue Rams will do best in a tank that is at least 20 gallons (75.7 L). If you add other fish or other cichlid pairs, then you’ll need to boost the tank size up to 30 or 40 gallons (110 or 150 L). The general rule is to allot one gallon of tank water per one inch of full-grown fish.Remember that German Blue Ram Cichlids can grow to be 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) at maturity.
Overcrowding is not a problem to be taken lightly. It can stress your fish out, making them more prone to illness. It can also lead to increased aggressiveness and even starvation.

, Cichlids are accustomed to tropical waters and they require consistent water temps of 76–85 °F (24.4–29.4 °C). A heater can be used to regulate your tank's temperature. An aquarium light improves tank visibility. Many people choose to purchase an aquarium hood that includes a built-in light and heater.


Whatever lighting setup you choose, German Blue Ram Cichlids do best with light during the daytime. So, turn on your tank light on in the morning and off when you go to bed. However, if the tank gets a good amount of natural sunlight, you may be able to lower your tank light time to 2-3 hours.Monitor the tank temperature via a stick-on thermometer.

, This is the base material that covers the floor of your tank. Blue Rams prefer sand or gravel, as they mirror a Ram’s natural habitat. Make sure to rinse your substrate out before adding, otherwise it will make your tank appear murky. Add at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of sand or gravel at the bottom of the tank and spread it out evenly., Blue Rams do best in a complex habitat with a number of good hiding spaces. Be sure to include plants, rocks, caves, and driftwood in your tank. These items will make water changes more of a hassle, but will improve the health of your cichlids in the long term.


Place larger plants on the outer perimeter of the tank. Make sure to leave swimming space in between and an open area in the middle of the tank. The Dwarf Amazon Sword and Brazilian Water Ivy are two plants that Blue Rams enjoy.Rocks and caves provide spaces for Blue Rams to escape from other fish. Blue Rams are naturally shy, so you will often see them seek out solitude. They will also hide from the breeding partners.A good selection of driftwood pieces can help regulate the pH level, provide great hiding spaces, and serve as a plant anchor. Make sure to buy your driftwood from a pet store, as this will ensure that is safe for aquarium use. You may notice some water yellowing after adding driftwood, this is perfectly normal and can be remedied via regular water changes."

Find suitable tank mates.,
Feed them the right foods on the correct schedule.,
Make your tank suitable for breeding.,
Test the water regularly.,
Commit to frequent water changes.,
Respond to any concerns immediately.",How to Keep German Blue Ram Cichlids3," Look for species that are categorized as non-aggressive. Tetras, Corys, and even some other types of Cichlids can coexist peacefully with Blue Rams. You will want to closely observe the interactions between various fish species to make sure that all parties are doing okay.Pay special attention to meal times as Blue Rams are leisurely eaters. Other aggressive eaters may consume all of the food, leaving only scraps for the Rams. This can cause starvation if not monitored and corrected.Male Blue Rams can become aggressive with one another if you don’t carefully control population numbers. Try to keep a ratio of one male for every three females. And, remember to up the tank size if you increase the number of fish., German Blue Ram Cichlids are omnivores, meaning that they eat both meats and vegetables. Feed them twice a day, as much food as they can eat in two minutes. Flakes and pellets work well, as do frozen options such as brine shrimp.Supplement their diet with fresh veggies, such as small pieces of spinach or romaine lettuce. These can be dropped directly in the tank and the leftovers removed with a net, if needed.Be aware that some Blue Rams will not eat well after being transferred to a new environment. Try to encourage eating by offering delicacies such as mosquito larvae., If you want your Blue Rams to breed, it is best to start with a group of 6-8 juveniles of both sexes. Keep a close eye on the water conditions and provide lots of rocky terrain and let nature take its course.Be aware that your newly mated couples might lose a batch or two. This is nothing to worry about and they will eventually figure out how to successfully breed. They may also eat some the eggs from these initial batches.After you spot the eggs, you can either leave them in their current tank or remove them to a 10-gallon aquarium. If you remove them, make sure to wait 24-hours to ensure fertilization., Blue Rams are notoriously picky about water quality. Readings that would be acceptable for most freshwater fish can cause a Blue Ram to become ill. A water testing kit will contain everything that you need to monitor the water parameters. Blue Rams require a pH of between 5.5-7.5.


If your pH reading is off, your Blue Rams’ health may gradually decline. If you find this to be the case, remove your fish, clean the tank and adjust the pH level, and add your fish back in following the standard acclimation procedures.Keep an eye on the readings of Ammonia, Nitrates, and Nitrites as well. Blue Rams require that all of the number stay less than .2 mg/L. Otherwise, a Blue Ram can essentially be poisoned by its own feces., To keep your tank up to Blue Ram standards, you need to do a 25% water change on a bi-daily or twice-weekly basis. Use this as an opportunity to clean your tank surfaces as well. You can suction out the debris from the rocks, etc.


Consider this maintenance schedule when considering move up from a 20 gallon (75.7 L) tank size.

, Blue Rams are generally quite healthy, but they can succumb to certain diseases and parasites. Ich is a parasite that can prey on Blue Rams. You will notice your fish acting listless if it is affected. Respond quickly with a tailored chemical treatment."

Symptoms of body flukes include an excessive layer of slime on the body; isolation; clamped fins (fins laying flush against the body); scratching and flashing (rubbing its flank against the side of the tank, plants, or decorative tank objects); gills or fins which appear to have been eaten away; sores and ulcers as the result of the scratching. Symptoms of gill flukes include gasping at the surface; irritation of the gills; gills covered in mucous; gasping at the surface; and visible irritation to the gills.;
, Take a small scraping from the sick goldfish and examine it under a microscope.To take a skin scraping, pick the fish up gently out of the water with a sock net. Hold the fish against the side of its bowl or tank. In your other hand, hold the slide at a 45 degree angle and press it down on the fish gently, pulling from the shoulder towards the tail. Always pull with the direction of the scales, never against, as this may hurt the fish. You should end up with some clear or opaque mucous on your slide. Once you have a sample, place a drop of water from the bowl or tank on top of the mucus. Place a cover slip over the slide. Examine your sample within the hour.Take multiple samples to ensure there are no flukes present.
You could detect flukes with a good magnifying glass,but the best way to see flukes is with a microscope at magnification of x40. Look for a translucent, ghostlike body moving about on the slide. Flukes have an elongated body with a rounded “head” and taper down to a pointed opisthohaptor (the organ it uses to latch onto the unsuspecting fish). You may see small hooks protruding from the fluke’s opisthohaptor, Depending on the species of fluke, they may or may not have eyespots. They are also extremely active; look for rapid elongation and contraction of the body., Raise the goldfish tank water to 70-78 degrees Fahrenheit and treat the water with an aquarium salt solution and Dimilin, Program, or a similar insect development inhibitor. Both Dimilin and Program utilize diflubenzuron to prevent the development of flukes and are nontoxic to filters, fish, and plants.


Apply the mixture at a ratio of one gram per thousand gallons of water. Mix the solution well to speed its dissolution in the water.Aquarium salt will treat over seven known pathogens, and Dimilin or Program will eliminate all parasites except the fluke. With these other options rules out, you can safely conclude that your goldfish are suffering an infestation of flukes., Your vet will have more comprehensive info about what to look for in potential fluke infestations, and can prescribe medication suited to your goldfish’s condition. Make careful observations regarding your goldfish’s behavior and appearance, and communicate them to your vet so he or she can make an informed decision about how to treat your fish.

, A quarantine tank is a special tank where you can isolate a fish suffering from flukes and apply baths, dips, and special treatments to it without treating your unaffected fish. If you have live plants in your tank, you can administer treatments in the quarantine tank without risk of harming them, too.A simple quarantine tank requires little more than a tank with a heater and a sponge filter.You can add some water from the main tank into the quarantine tank to afford stressing the fish. Water from the top of the aquarium works best. Find a tank that has a dark bottom; if the tank is clear, place it on a dark mat or table. You could also add some artificial plants to give the fish something to interact with.Ensure your quarantine tank is well-aerated, since the treatments applied often consume oxygen in the tank. Use an oxygen pump to ensure the tank receives a steady flow of oxygen. Over-oxygenating the tank is nearly impossible; unless your fish is wary of venturing near the bubbling area, or your pump is causing the tank to vibrate from the force of expelled oxygen, you are not adding too much to the tank.
Unless otherwise noted, the following treatments all require isolating the affected fish in a treatment tank.

, Formalin is a disinfectant used to kill microorganisms or preserve biological tissues.


If employing Formalin-MS (a common formalin solution), use 20 drops per gallon of water (or 1 teaspoon per 9 gallons). Dip fish for up to fifty minutes. Remove fish from the tank if it shows signs of distress.Formalin can be used in quarantine tanks or in the main tank.

A quarantine tank solution will contain 20-25 parts formalin per million parts of water. Depending on severity of the infestation, dip your fish in the quarantine tank for 12-24 hours. Remove fish after dip is complete and rinse in clean water. Return fish to its main tank. Repeat twice in three-day intervals.
Formalin can be employed in the main goldfish tank as well as in quarantine tanks. However, when treating the whole tank with formalin as opposed to a quarantine tank, you must use a lower concentration. Mix 2 drops of Formalin-MS per gallon of water. Perform a 25% water change after 3 days and replace your filtration unit. Repeat two times, once every three days.



, A chemical compound with many uses, Methylene Blue constitutes an effective treatment against flukes by staining cells and disabling their metabolism. A dip regimen utilizing Methylene Blue calls for a mixture of 12 mg of MB per liter of water. This solution will treat a saltwater fish for up to one hour and a freshwater fish for up to 10 minutes. A dip can be as high as 50 mg/l for duration of 10 seconds. After dipping, return the fish to its tank or bowl. Do not keep it beyond the required period in the MB solution.


Do not use Methylene Blue in your main tank with the biological filter. It will destroy the bacteria living within the filter.

, Mix 30-35 grams of salt per liter of water. Use specialty aquarium salts designed for use in aquariums; these are readily available at pet stores. Dip the fish in the bath for 4-5 minutes. Repeat daily for three treatments. Change 30-70 % of the water between treatments.


While common, this treatment is not always effective. Flukes lodged beneath the fish’s skin may be protected by the fish’s own mucous membrane., Mix a solution composed of one part acetic acid with 400-500 parts water. Dip the fish in the solution for 40-60 seconds before returning it to its main tank. Repeat the dip one week later.This is one of the few treatments which does not require 3-4 treatment sessions.

, There are a number of options for treating flukes which employ some form of praziquantel, a medication used to treat parasites in dogs and cats as well as fish.It is an expensive treatment but is the least harmful to your goldfish and other creatures living in your aquarium, including plants. Praziquantel is available commercially in most pet stores.Dip fish in the mixture for 3-6 hours, then remove it back to its main tank. Repeat the treatment two more times, once every three days. Change 30-70% of the tank water before each subsequent treatment.Praziquantel is the best option to treat flukes in goldfish. Mix 5-10 mg of Praziquantel per liter of water.
Praziquantel may also be dosed in the fish feed. Apply 5 mg per kg of goldfish.
Your veterinarian could inject Praziquantel directly into your fish. Ask your vet if this option is right for your fish.
There are a multitude of medicines suitable for fluke-infested fish whose active ingredient is praziquantel. Prazipro Fluke tabs are a popular option, as is Droncit.Other praziquantel treatments include Lifeguard, Tetra Parasite Guard, and Fungus Guard.All are available at pet stores.

, Acriflavine-MS is an effective anti-parasitic treatment designed for use in aquatic environments. Mix 1 teaspoon per 10 gallons of water. Utilize daily until the infestation is gone. Treat daily after changing 25%-50% of tank water. Adjust your dose to match the volume of exchanged water. For instance, if you have ten gallons of water and remove 50%, add a full spoonful of Acriflavine to the tank, then refill the tank to its maximum ten gallon capacity.Acriflavine is also known as eufavine, gonacrine, neutroflavine, and trypaflavine.

, OPs work against flukes by disrupting their nervous systems. These compounds are potentially toxic to fish and must be used with caution.


Trichlorfon is the most common OP used to treat fish. Recommended dosages depend on the tank temperature. For temperatures above 27o C add 0.25 mg per liter of water. For temperatures below 27o C add 0.50 mg per liter of water.
Another option is to mix Trichlorfon with water in a ratio of 0.25-1.0 parts per million. Dip fish in the mixture for one hour. Repeat daily for three days. Change 30-70% of the water between treatments and adjust the Trichlorfon level as needed. , No matter how you choose to treat your fluke outbreak, repeat your selected method at least 3-4 times (unless directed otherwise). For instance, if you choose salt baths, apply the baths 3-4 times. Several generations of fluke larvae can live inside the mother flukes, so repeated applications of the treatment are necessary.


Four days after the final treatment, you may once again begin performing routine water changes.

, Use any treatment method you desire at least once following the reintroduction of the afflicted fish back into its main tank. Then, remove all the water from the tank and let it dry. If you have been treating your fish in quarantine tanks or using dips rather than changing the water in your primary tank, you will need to clean those tanks to ensure the flukes are gone as well.


Assuming you opted to treat the whole tank, your biological filter should be free of flukes. If you did not, use a praziquantel treatment on the filter for the prescribed period. If you are less cautious, you could choose to just rinse the filter well with dechlorinated water.

, After the treatment is complete, take another set of scrapings from your goldfish and examine them beneath the microscope. If you do not see flukes, your little fish friend is in the clear.


Even if you don’t see flukes, remain vigilant. They may have been reduced to a level you cannot detect. Pay attention in the weeks ahead to the behavior of your fish which may indicate they have returned.

, When introducing new fish into the tank, check for flukes by taking a scraping and checking it under the microscope. Even where you do not detect flukes, keep them in quarantine for at least a month before letting them join their friends in the main tank.


Avoid adding new goldfish once you verify all the fish in a given tank are healthy. Recent research suggests that a closed community of goldfish will actually develop an immunity to flukes., Flukes can be caused by poor water conditions. Check your water with test strips or kits (readily available at your local pet store) regularly. A good test kit will measure for water pH, salinity, alkalinity, nitrites, and oxygen levels. Water with high levels of ammonia is especially toxic. Invest in a quality biological filtration system to ensure water is clean and properly aerated. Change the water in your fish tank regularly to reduce incidence of fluke outbreaks.Perform a 25% water change (at least) each week.

, Do not keep fish in congested conditions. Overcrowding is a leading cause of fluke infestations.Allow plenty of room for fish to swim naturally, grow, and breed. Limiting the number of goldfish per tank will also keep tank conditions more sanitary.


A single goldfish requires 20-30 gallons of water depending on its particular species., Do not populate your goldfish tank with snails or aquatic creatures who may serve as intermediate hosts. Similarly, do not feed your goldfish any live food sourced from waters in which flukes may reside."

A 30-gallon tank is ideal for one pair of breeding convicts. If you have the space, a 40-gallon breeder tank is ideal, especially if you’re planning to breed more than one pair of convict cichlids.


Make sure that you don’t exceed more than one breeding pair per 20 gallons (75.7 L) of water. This will help to prevent aggression between breeding pairs of fish.;
, You may want to consider setting up a separate smaller tank to put the fry in once they’ve begun to mature, in order to protect them from getting eaten by their parents. This tank can be between 5 to 10 gallons (18.9 to 37.9 L) in capacity.


Use a sponge filter and an aquarium heater in this nursery tank., New baby fish (also known as fry) are going to constantly be born in your tank, so the bio-load on your aquarium will begin to be strained. Bio-load is a term which refers to the accumulated waste produced by your fish, which places demand on your aquarium’s filtration system.You’ll need a power filter which has the capacity to filter at least double the volume of your tank. If you have a 30-gallon tank, choose a filter that can clean at least 60 gallons (230 L) per hour., Because convict cichlids can be a naturally aggressive fish, you will want to provide plenty of hiding places in your tank. Add some flat stones and a cave (or flowerpot) or two to the tank. The convicts will lay their eggs on the flat stones, and the caves will provide shelter to the fry once they are born.

, You may choose to add some hardier plants such as the java fern or Amazonian sword plant to the tank to add some decoration and make the fish feel more at home in their environment.Most other plants will be uprooted or destroyed by the convicts.Adding plants to your aquarium will also improve the oxygen content of your tank and remove the carbon dioxide and nitrogen that your fish generate. This helps to make your tank a healthier environment for your convicts, and helps to reduce the strain on your filtration system., Driftwood makes a great addition to your aquarium setup. It provides shelter to your convicts as well as blocks the line of sight from one end of the aquarium to the other, which may help prevent your fish from fighting and injuring each other.Driftwood also adds some visual interest to your tank, and is much healthier for your fish as well as more aesthetically pleasing than plastic aquarium decorations.

, Breeding convict cichlids require clean water conditions to ensure a healthy living and breeding environment, and to reduce stress. Change out 20-25% of the water in the tank once every 3 days.

, To promote breeding, increase the water temperature in your tank to between 75-79 degrees.Be careful not to raise the temperature in your aquarium to more than 82 degrees; the high temperature will pose a danger to your fish.Most aquarium heaters can be set for a specific temperature. You may want to get a stick-on thermometer as well, which will allow you to quickly check the water temperature whenever you glance at your aquarium.

, The pH in your aquarium should be between 6.5 and 8.0.Although convict cichlids are hardy fish, and can survive a wide range of pH conditions, keeping a stable pH in this range is ideal for reproduction purposes.Test your aquarium's pH level with easy to use paper test strips which can be bought at any pet store. To use the strips, simply dip them in your aquarium water, and compare the resulting color to a provided chart.

, It’s best to start with 6 convicts, in order to allow the pairing to occur naturally. You can tell if a convict is female by the bright yellow-orange coloring on their belly and spots on their dorsal fin. The color patches become more pronounced just before egg-laying. Males don't have the same bright coloring, but are larger, and have a steeper forehead and longer, more pointed fins than the female.Due to their aggressive temperament it is not recommended that you keep convict cichlids in the same tank with any other breed of fish.There are several color variants to consider when choosing your fish. The regular black and white convict cichlids are the easiest to breed, but an albino variant known as the ivory cichlid and a pink variant are beautiful options as well., The female convict will take the initiative in the mating cycle. After choosing a dark hiding place, the female courts the male, then lays her eggs on the flat rocks or on the side of a flower pot.Once laid, the eggs will be carefully guarded by their parents. This is when convicts display their most aggressive behavior.

, The eggs, which average around 100 -200 per brood, will hatch after about 3 days. It will take another few days before the fry start swimming around the tank under the protection of their parents.The parent fish will try to keep the fry in place for 10 to 14 days, after which time they may be ready to breed again.At this time, you may want to consider moving the fry to their own nursery tank, as the parents will sometimes eat the first batch of fry to make room for the new eggs.

, For the first 5-7 days after they hatch, the fry can subsist entirely on what is left of the yolk sac. Feeding them during this time will only contaminate the water quality in your tank because the food will remain in the tank uneaten., They can eat brine shrimp nauplii for the first few weeks, then switch to crushed up flake food or special fry food. They will also eat blood and tubifex worms when they get a few days older.

, Make sure that you feed your fish at least a couple of times a day. Due to their aggressive nature, hungry convict cichlids may try to eat each other if they miss a meal., This is so that once the parent fish are ready to breed again, the fry won’t be in danger of being eaten to make room for the new babies. This can happen after 10-14 days, so make sure to watch for signs of aggression from the parent fish, which may signal that they are preparing to breed again."

But that's just a preferable size, you can choose the size of your tank according to your own personal choice. When you do this make sure that you don't take a tank with thin glass. Check that the tank doesn't leak when you buy it from the shop.;
, The flooring can be done in different layers but it's best to stick with one single layer. You can use gravel or substrate or sand. The finer the flooring materials the better.


Make sure that it covers 1/20th of the tank's height.

, Decorate using your imagination any way you like. Remember that the ornaments should not take up more than 40% of the tank space. Give some shade or hiding place for the fishes to rest when they get fatigued or want shelter.

, Leave about 1/20th space at the top of the tank. Stop pouring water at that level.

, Turn it on to enable circulation and filtration of water. It is to be turned on the entire day; do not turn it off.

, These are a must as temperature control is crucial. For community tanks the average acceptable temperature is 22-27 degrees Celsius. Make sure that the temperature is within this range.

, Keep the filter turned on for 3 days at least to enable helpful bacteria to develop as these will help keep the tank clean. You may add fishes and other aquatic animals after this period.

, Do not just pour them in; put the plastic bag they came in in the aquarium water for 20 minutes before releasing them. If you're not sure what fish to get, some options include:


Guppies
Zebra Fish
Neon Tetras are also a good choice for beginners. Zebrafish and Neons are schooling fish so they will be fun to watch.

, Do it once in the morning and once at night. Avoid overfeeding, as this will make water cloudy. The number of pellets you give should be double the number of your total fish if you have Guppies/Zebra/Molly/Platy/Neons; for other fish, follow any species-specific suggestions.

, No light in fish tanks can result in fishes getting de-colorized or worse-blind!

Aim for 10 additional gallons (38 L) for each fish if you're planning on giving your fish some companions. Parrot cichlids like to have several hiding places along the bottom of the aquarium, so a taller tank wouldn't help.;
, Parrot cichlids are large fish with healthy appetites. Their tendency to dig in the substrate can stir up dirt and algae. This is why they require a larger filter. A heavy-duty wet/dry filter will help to remove these waste products and keep the water clean. Purchase a filter that can be mounted to the back of the tank. Avoid anything that goes under the substrate, as digging fish can easily disturb its functioning., Many breeds of parrot cichlids originate in warm South American climates. Keep the aquarium temperature about 76 to 84 °F (24 to 29 °C).Even blood parrot cichlids, bred in captivity by humans, thrive in warmer waters. Temperatures below 80 °F (27 °C) might cause cichlids to become less social., Parrot cichlids like to dig, so make sure the substrate is soft. Opt for fine dark sand, which they can comfortably burrow under. Avoid putting plants in the aquarium, since the cichlid's tendency to dig could knock them over., Parrot cichlids can be territorial, especially if you plan on adding smaller tankmates. Keep broken flowerpots, small rocks, driftwood, or stacked rocks to form caves that provide the fish with hiding spots., Place your cichlid into the aquarium while they're still in the bag. Let them remain there for at least 15-30 minutes. Then, gently scoop your fish into a net and into the aquarium. Dispose of the bag water by dumping it down the drain or watering your garden if you have one. Don't let any water from the bag drip into the aquarium., Parrot cichlids are omnivorous, meaning that they'll eat plant or animal products. Proper food includes brine shrimp, bloodworms, tropical flakes, sinking pellets, and commercial parrot cichlid food. Make sure your fish get enough fiber to prevent swim bladder disease. Feed your fish at least twice a day., Choose light bulbs that emit light from the red end of the visible spectrum. Purchase them at pet supply stores or hobbyist stores. Blue light could dull the color of your fish's scales. The lighting shouldn't be too bright, as cichlids prefer darker waters in the wild. Keep the wattage between 0.5 and 1 watt per gallon (4 L).Don't leave the lights on for more than 12 hours per day. Too much light for too long can encourage the growth of deadly cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green “algae”).Change the lightbulbs if they're a year old., A good pH for a parrot cichlid would be between 6.5 to 7.8. Monitor the water and every object you put in the tank. This includes driftwood and other hiding places, as well as the substrate. Rocks that contain too much calcium can make the water too alkaline and can dull your fish's color. Wild breeds of parrot cichlids can tolerate pH levels as low as 4.0 before feeling any health effects. Buy pH testing strips in any pet supply store or big box store., High levels of nitrite and phosphate can contribute to cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), which can kill your fish.To prevent the algae from growing, use separate testing kits for nitrite and phosphate. Nitrite shouldn't exceed 0.1 parts per million (ppm), and phosphate shouldn't go over 0.2 ppm.


If the phosphate levels get too high, add a phosphate-removing material to your filter. For high levels of nitrite, clean all debris from the tank with a siphon vacuum. Then, clean out your filter thoroughly. Remove a third of the water in the tank and replace with with clean water.If you notice cyanobacteria growth, install balanced bulbs that emit 6,000 to 14,000 kilowatts. Lower the tank temperature to 76 °F (24 °C). Change 10 percent of the water every other day until nitrite and phosphate return to normal. Use a testing kit to measure their levels., Siphon at least 20 to 25 percent of the water in the tank. Aim for 25 percent if you have several fish. Clean any algae growing on the glass and/or in the substrate. Algae can be green or brown when growing on surfaces. Algae blooms occur on the water. Tackle them by:


Not worrying too much about green algae growing on decorations. It's generally harmless.
Cleaning brown algae growing on the tank, with a sponge or algae magnet. Use a siphon vacuum to remove any algae growing on decorations or the substrate.Recognizing algae blooms. Green, cloudy water is the telltale sign. Replace all of the water. Clean the entire tank and its components thoroughly. Install a diatomic filter to remove any lurking algae and prevent recurrences., Parrot cichlids are rather territorial and will act aggressively toward smaller fish. If you choose to add other fish, consider silver dollars, black skirt tetras, convict cichlids, and other semi-aggressive fish nearly the size of the parrot cichlid. Avoid smaller tetra, angelfish, discus, and ram cichlids., Ich is a highly contagious parasite that takes the form of small white cilia-covered spots on the fish's body. To fight it, raise the tank temperature to 86 °F (30 °C) for three days. This should kill the parasite.If the spots don't disappear after three days, put your fish in a quarantine tank and add cupramine (copper solution) to the water. Follow the instructions on the label. Keep the copper levels at 0.2 ppm. You can measure copper levels with a salifert test kit that you can find in hobby stores.Kill off the Ich in the original tank with aquarium salts, which you can buy in pet supply stores. Add one teaspoon (5 g) per gallon (4 L) of water every 12 hours for 36 hours. Let the salt remain in the tank for 7 to 10 days., Blood parrot cichlids have parrot-like mouths and back humps. This unique anatomy puts them at risk for swim bladder disease. In this condition, the fish gets constipated and swims at an awkward angle. To correct this problem, feed the fish two to three shelled peas once a week to regulate the bowels., Parrot cichlids, especially blood parrot cichlids, are also prone to bacterial infections, fungal infections, and parasites like skin flues and worms. Talk to your vet or read books that detail common diseases among parrot cichlids. Recognize the early symptoms and how to treat them. As with many diseases, early detection can make a world of difference."

Otherwise, make your own mixture of egg yolk and other materials.",How to Breed Discus," There is no surefire way to visually identify discus fish sex, and it is especially difficult before the fish are fully grown. Adult males usually have thicker lips, and may act more aggressive. However, if you have a large enough tank, the best approach is to keep at least four discus fish, to increase the odds of having both a male and a female.


Some strains of discus may tend to display different patterns on the male and female fish, but this is not guaranteed.Females usually mate at about 9 months of age, while males usually mate at 13 months.;
, Discus are unlikely to breed if they are kept in too small a container. Any discus tank should be at least 15 inches (38 cm) deep.Keep a pair of discus in a tank that can hold at least 50 gallons (191 liters). If you are keeping four to six discus, use a tank that can hold at least 67 gallons (255 liters)., Aquarium stores should sell test kits with the tools you need to measure the content of these substances in your water. If your nitrite (with an i) or ammonia levels are above 0 ppm, or your nitrate (with an a) levels are above 20 ppm, the water could be toxic to your fish. Run a fishless cycle if the tank is empty, or consult an experienced aquarium keeper if not.


Look for a more comprehensive aquarium kit that provides some or all of the testing tools in the steps below.

, The temperature in your aquarium should be at 82 degrees F (27.7 C) or higher to create suitable breeding conditions. The water pH test results should be stable around 6.5 pH, never rising to 7.0 or higher. Purchase an electronic conductivity tester to test for mineral content, which should be between 100 and 200 microsiemens.If any of these need adjusting, do so with minimal adjustments to avoid harming the fish, and follow these tips:


Adding substances to raise or lower the pH will also raise the conductivity reading. Keep measuring all characteristics daily as you make adjustments.
Adding reverse osmosis water is not recommended unless you need to lower conductivity below 200 microsiemens.In other situations, normal tap water should be fine.

, Change 10% of the water daily, or 20–30% of the water twice a week, to keep the tank as clean as possible while you are encouraging the discus to breed. Siphon collected filth from the bottom of the tank whenever necessary. If the sides of the tank need cleaning, do so before the water change, to avoid clouding the new water.

, A variety of live foods such as mosquito larvae, adult brine shrimp, or white worms are best for providing adult discus with the nutrition they need for breeding. If live food is not available, feed them beef heart or, as a last resort, flake food high in animal protein. You may occasionally feed them tropical fish vitamin supplements, powdered spinach, spirulina, or high quality flake food for some extra nutrients.Collecting live food from fresh water yourself increases the risk of transmitting disease to your fish. Many aquarium hobbyists purchase from a reliable, disease-free source, then raise the live food at home to lower this risk further.

, Surfaces low to the ground may encourage the fish to lay eggs, and will make egg transfer easier if you plan to separate them from the parents. You may use tall, upturned flower pots, a breeding cone from an aquarium store, or a short length of PVC pipe.Keeping the aquarium itself in a quiet place may also increase the odds of breeding occurring.


Don't worry if the discus lay eggs directly on the floor, as long as the parents are defending the eggs from other fish.

, If a pair of discus fish start hanging out together in a corner, cleaning a spawning area, or acting aggressive to other discus, this is likely a male and a female discus, and they should spawn soon. If the mated pair gets extra aggressive, you may need to separate them from the rest of the tank's inhabitants.

, A few drops of methylene blue added to the water helps protect the eggs from bacteria and fungus.Look for this substance at an aquarium store or online, and add with an eyedropper.

, If all goes well, raising the young ""fry"" with parents may increase the survival rate significantly. However, some discus parents may eat the eggs or fry, or spread diseases. It's possible that discus raised by parents tend to be better parents themselves, which is useful if you plan to continue breeding fish for multiple generations. Continue on to the relevant section once you've made your decision.


If you or someone you know has an experienced mated pair of discus, you could use those two as surrogate parents, Tanks with fry should only use gentle methods of water filtration and oxygenation, to prevent sucking in fry or exhausting them with a constant current. Adjust your tank's filters if necessary once you've decided which tank the fry will be raised in.

, After two or three days, the eggs should hatch. However, the young fish, or fry, typically remain attached to the egg site for some time. If you notice the parents eating the eggs while you are waiting, consider moving the parents and following the instructions for raising discus without parents instead.

, Within a few days of hatching, the fry should detach and move to the parents' sides, where they feed from the parents' skin. You may increase the odds of the fry locating the parents by temporarily reducing the water levels to roughly 9 inches (25cm).Discus strains with light coloring may be harder for the fry to locate.
Remove the surface eggs were attached to, if the fry attempt to feed from it.

, Once the fry have been swimming freely for about four days, start supplementing their diet with a tiny amount of live baby brine shrimp four times a day.Clean out dead shrimp if uneaten on the same day, in order to keep the water clean.
If you cannot use live, frozen is acceptable. Use a medium slow bubble on the air stone to get the frozen baby brine shrimp moving around the aquarium, or the fry may not recognize it as food.

, Once the fry have reached six weeks of age, they can eat a greater variety of food. Try to feed them a wide variety of animal protein as well as vitamin-rich vegetables. Many discus breeders are willing to share their own recipe for ""discus burger,"" which contains all these ingredients blended into a consistency that is easy for the small fish to eat.


You may move the fry to a different tank at this age, away from the parents. This may be necessary to prevent overcrowding.

, Make sure the new tank has all the same water attributes described in the section on encouraging breeding, but use a smaller tank for a higher chance of success.If the eggs are laid onto the floor of the tank instead of on a pipe or spawning cone, you may need to move the adult fish instead.


Continue changing the water frequently, as described in the breeding section.

, After a couple days, the eggs will hatch, but it may take a couple days before the fry move away from the egg area and start swimming freely.

, Rotifers are microscopic organisms found in pond water. However, rotifers collected in the wild may contain harmful diseases. Instead, purchase a clean source of rotifers from an aquarium store.Rotifers may multiply on their own, making exact feeding instructions difficult. Ideally, feed the fry minuscule amounts (the size of a blunt pencil tip) ten or more times a day, or according to the rotifer packaging instructions for fish fry., Many breeders smear egg yolk to the side of the tank for the fry to feed on. This may result in slower growth than the rotifers method, but it may be cheaper or easier. Mix other discus food such as spirulina and baby brine shrimp into the egg yolk for added nutrition. You may need to mix together both hard boiled and raw egg yolk to produce a mixture that sticks to the side of the tank.The discus can be fed on ordinary food after six week, although using a recipe for ""discus burger"" after that point is recommended while they are growing.

Know your fish!,
Keep a heating system in your aquarium.,
Try to keep them in a species ONLY aquarium.,
Acclimate your cichlid.,
Give them things to hide behind.,
Feed them the best diet you can.",How to Care for Mbuna Cichlids," It's always great to know of what you get before you buy and that is why we have research. Mbuna cichlid, a type of cichlid from lake Malawi, come in hundreds of types, but the mostly community cichlids can vary from 5-6"" in length yet, some can be smaller. These cichlids can be kept in a community aquarium but, some do not do as well as others. The minimum of gallons for a community aquarium is at least 75 gallons (283.906 Liters).;
, African cichlids, (like all cichlids) need heated water. A decent temperature in the aquarium would be 73*F-80*F (21.6*C-26.6*C).

, However some bottom dwelling catfish can be kept with Mbuna cichlids, if the water parameters are similar.

, Acclimation should at least take 15-30 minutes, and without acclimation the cichlid or any other fish would have aquarium shock. When acclimation leave the aquarium light off, then place the bag in the water letting it set for 15-30 minutes, then gently opening the bag, netting the fish out into the aquarium, then disposing of the water without water reaching into the aquarium.

, Keeping them in an aquarium cluttered with hiding spots is a great way to keep your cichlid from becoming stressed. Stacked rocks, flowerpots and aquarium plants can be kept in the aquarium as successful hiding spots, as well as Driftwood.

, Feeding your cichlid what's best usually gives them proper nutrition which will promote growth and may help to enhance color. Mbuna while considered herbivores amongst many, are technically omnivores. In the wild, they graze rocks and lake beds for algae and consume small crustaceans as a result of this type of feeding. That does not mean you should start throwing blood worms or krill in to the tank however. In fact, foods high in animal protein can lead to a hard to treat and usually fatal illness known as Malawi bloat. Many hobbyist give krill for a treat and to substitute normal feedings once a month or so and it is recommended to never feed blood worms. Fresh veggies such as blanched peas, cucumber, squash, cabbage, and romaine lettuce can also be given but be sure to clean these foods thoroughly. Foods such as: Cichlid pellets designed for African cichlids and/or spirulina flakes would suit these cichlids best.

This can ensure your cichlids have enough space to comfortably breed and hide if necessary.Keep in mind that most people keep multiple cichlids in one tank, so the bigger the tank you can get, the more optimal the environment is for breeding.;
, Good water quality is important to keeping your Malawi cichlids healthy and happy. Making sure the water quality is appropriate to Malawis can also give them the best environment in which to breed.Test the water with fish tank water testing, which you can get at most pet stores. These tests can identify problems with the water quality, such as if the water is too acidic. Malawi cichlids like alkaline water that is a pH of 8.0 or above. If the water is not alkaline enough, you can use a carbonate buffer, calcium, or magnesium buffer to raise the levels and make the water harder.Make sure the water temperature is 80 °F (26.7 °C) (27 Celcius).You may also want to test that oxygen saturation in the tank exceeds 70%., Cichlids can create a lot of waste in their water. An important part of maintaining their water quality, which will also optimize breeding, is to filter it. It may also help the spawn survive.Choose a gentle filter or a freshwater trickle filter, which is good for large stocked tanks with cichlids. Make sure you replace or clean your filter once a month or more often as necessary., Most tanks for Malawis do well with a layer of sand on the bottom.But they also like to have hiding spaces, especially during breeding. This will give your Malawi cichlids a place to breed and the fry, or baby fish, a place to hide from adults that may eat them.Place a few flattish stones near one another on the bottom of the tank as breeding sites.You can also glue small stones together with aquarium silicone to form a “cave” in which the Malawis can breed and fry can hide.Use a few small clay pots in the tank as hiding spaces. You can easily make these more natural—and beautiful—looking in the tank by using aquarium silicone to glue small stones on the pots.

, There are several different species of Malawi cichlids and you likely have a mixture in your tank. Make sure that you have males and females of both species in the tank.This can prevent hybrids, which may not have the same beautiful color as their parents and could also be sterile.It can also ensure that males and females also have partners with which to breed in the event that a specific pairing doesn’t work.


Be aware that most cichlid species are dimorphic, which means the males and females have distinct coloring patterns. If you have dimorphic fish and are unsure, you can check a guide to find a picture of the specific coloring.Recognize that you may have difficulty discerning subtle color differences in dimorphic cichlids or your cichlids may be monomorphic. If this is the case, you’ll need to “vent” them, which means checking the genital papilla. You can find this by taking your fish out of the water and finding its anal pore. Just underneath this is the genital papilla, and the female’s is generally larger than the male’s papilla.

, The health and vitality of your cichlids is important to breeding. Making sure that you feed—and not overfeed-- your cichlids This can optimize breeding and make sure the eggs and fry survive.Make sure to feed your cichlids according to their specific species need, which can range from small shrimp to algae in the tank. In most cases, specialized cichlid food is enough to keep your cichlids healthy. Consider getting something with Spirulina flakes which is high in protein and other nutrients Malawi cichlids need.Give your fish only as much food as they can consume in 20-30 seconds. Do this by sprinkling in food 3-4 times a day, which can ensure that each fish gets enough to eat and can prevent aggression. Avoid overfeeding your cichlids because this can lead to “bloat” and is often fatal.

, Unhealthy fish do not make good breeding fish. If any of your Malawi cichlids are showing signs of illness, you’ll need to treat them before they breed. If you don’t know the cause, use a commercial fish medication. This can relieve the fish of any illnesses or parasites and help breeding.Recognize typical symptoms of illness in fish: white spots or velvety patches on the body, missing scales, incomplete or ripped fins, bulging or cloudy eyes, ulcers or lesions, shaking and rapid breathing. You may also see behavioral signs of disease such as scraping against the tank, erratic swimming, listlessness, gasping at the surface, or sulking in a corner.Talk to a pet store associate about commercial fish medications if you are unsure of what to get. Recognize that commercial fish medications are not regulated by laws or government agencies. This means the medication may not work or could harm your Malawi cichlids., Although there is no definitive way to tell if your Malawis are ready to breed, there are certain signs that males and females are ready to breed. Watching them to detect signs can help you figure out if your Malawis are preparing to breed. This can also let you know when to remove males that may eat the fry.Look to see if the males are digging caves, which are actually nests, in the sand and near hiding spots.
Observe the shape of the female to see if she is slightly plumper than normal. If she is, this can be a sign that she is ready to lay eggs in the nest the male has dug., Just as they exhibit certain signs of being ready to breed, Malawi cichlids also have specific behavior they use when trying to attract a mate. Looking for signs of attraction can alert you to watch for eggs and fry as well as remove the male so that he doesn’t eat the babies.See if the male fish starts shimmying towards the female and flicking water her way with his tail. If he does, the female may follow him to his designated spot. This begins the breeding process. If the female isn’t ready, she may not follow the male and he may move on to another female.

, Many people who breed cichlids have problems with the process while others can’t keep their fish away from one another. If you have several males and females from each species and have a healthy, natural environment, your cichlids may just need a little time before they start breeding.Keep in mind that cichlids are animals and will pair off naturally when they are ready. It make take a while for your cichlids to get used to their tank or their tank mates.
Make sure the tank is as natural and clean as possible. Adding a little sand, clean water, or some natural stones for hiding spots if you don’t already have them may stimulate the desire to breed. You also need to make sure that you’re not moving hiding spaces or caves around as they give your cichlids a sense of permanence and security. This can also help them relax and find a mate.
Check your feeding patterns. Overfed fish rarely breed. Is there food leftover in the tank? If so, consider cutting back one feeding a day and how long you feed the fish. For example, cut back to 20 second feedings 3 times a day to see if that helps. You can even cut down to one quality feedings a day if necessary. Use high quality foods and increase proteins with foods like spirulina.

, If a female Malawi cichlid follows her male to his nest, then they will begin the breeding process. You can easily observe this by watching for the pair to continuously circle around one another, head to tail.Be aware the male and female Malawi cichlids may stop every half circle so that the female can collect fertilized eggs in her mouth and the male can fertilize laid eggs. After the pair has mated the female will have a mouthful of eggs. Her throat will be distended and her face will look square like., Once the Malawis have bred, the female will need some rest to allow the eggs to develop in her mouth. Not disturbing her for 5 days should be sufficient time for the female to rest. Be aware that she may not eat during this period.Consider partitioning your tank so that the female can have her own space. This is especially true if you choose to not remove the male from the tank. Likewise, you can also put the female in a separate tank. Remember to disturb her as little as possible because she may spit out the eggs or even swallow them.

, A female Malawi cichlid will hold her fertilized eggs in her mouth for about 21 days. At this point, she will begin to release the fry, or baby fish, from her mouth into the hiding spots or tank. Be aware that it may take a couple of days for the female to release the fry into the water.Recognize that Malawi cichlids have relatively small batches of eggs—only 10-30. You may see anywhere from 1-30 fry, depending on their survival rate.Make sure that there are hiding spots in the tank under or in which the fry can hide from males. Don’t be surprised if the female takes the fry into her mouth several times. The females will eventually abandon their fry, and it’s important for the young fish to have hiding spots., Your fry will need nutritious food to develop into healthy Malawi cichlids. There are a number of different nutritious foods you can feed Malawi cichlid fry. You can also watch if they’re eating enough of their food by watching their bodies with a magnifying glass. You can feed your fry the following foods to promote growth:


Brine shrimp
Daphnia
Microworms
Grindal worms
The fry are large and well developed, so infusoria is too small for them.

Check for a slender or round body shape.,

Look for bright coloring and patterns on the guppy’s body.,
Check for the gravid spot on the underside of the guppy’s tail.,
Look at the shape of the guppy’s dorsal fin.,
Check the shape of the guppy’s tail fin.,
Notice the length and shape of the guppy’s anal fin.",How to Identify Male and Female Guppies," The body shape of male and female guppies is very different and distinctive. Male guppies usually have very slender, long bodies, while female guppies are usually a lot rounder and bigger than the males, sometimes twice as big as a male guppy.If your female guppy is pregnant, her body may look boxy or stuffed and even lumpy. She may grow even rounder as she gets closer to birthing her young.You may want to use a magnifying glass to get a better look at your guppy’s shape, size, and coloring as it swims around in its tank.;
, You may want to try to do an approximate measurement of your guppies to help determine their sex. Female guppies can grow up to 2 ⅛ inches (6 cm) and are often a lot larger than male guppies. In contrast, male guppies can grow up to 1-⅛ inches (3 cm)., Male guppies are often much more colorful than their female counterpart and their bodies may be covered in bright coloring and patterns. Males may have bodies and tails covered in orange, blue, violet, green, black, and white spots and stripes. They use this coloring to attract a female mate.Keep in mind that spotting a lot of bright colors and patterns on your guppy is not a sure fire way to identify it as male. Some types of guppies have females who are also quite colorful, so you may want to use other physical markers to determine the sex of your guppy in addition to coloring.You can look at different breeds of guppies online to determine what breed your guppy is as well as the different coloring and patterns on your breed's tail., While you are examining your guppy’s body shape and coloring, you should go a bit closer to your fish and check for a gravid spot. The gravid spot is a dark spot located on the underside of your guppy’s body, near the tail, and is a clear marker of a female. Males do not have a gravid spot.A pregnant female guppy’s gravid spot will get darker and bigger as she gets closer to delivering her young. As her due date approaches, you may be able to actually see the babies inside her, close to her gravid spot. Once she has her babies, her gravid spot will get lighter and then darken again when she gets pregnant again.

, The dorsal fin is located on the top of the fish, about two to three inches from the fish’s head. Male guppies have longer dorsal fins that flow in the water as they swim around. Female guppies have shorter dorsal fins that do not trail in the water as they swim., The guppy’s tail fin, or the caudal, can help you determine the sex of the guppy. Male guppies have wide, long caudal fins that are often brightly colored, with elaborate patterns. Female guppies will have shorter caudal fins that are not as wide and long as the males., The guppy’s anal fin is located under the fish and is the smaller fin right before the tail fin. A male guppy will have an anal fin that is long and narrow, with a slightly pointed end. He will use his anal fin to deliver sperm into the female.In contrast, a female guppy will have a shorter anal fin that appears triangular in shape. Her gravid spot will be located right above her anal fin.

Take care choosing, as one of the drawbacks about guppies is how many other species of fish enjoy them as a tasty snack.,
Use the following is a list of which species can be tank mates and why they can.,
Try other species.,
Add some bottom dwellers.,
Try putting some rasboras in there.,
Pick what works for you.",How to Find Compatible Tank Mates for Guppies," It is quite a selective job, finding the perfect tank mates for guppies that'll neither bother guppies nor eat them. You have to make sure that the fish you get for them aren't too big-you would not want to put in, for example, angelfish, because these can quite easily eat guppies as well as nip guppies' beautiful, long, flowing fins.


This is another concept you have to consider when selecting tank mates for guppies. Guppies have very long, flowing fins that resemble the fins of the beautiful bettas, and lots of fish like to nip these fins. If they aren't eating guppies, they're nipping the fins of guppies. You have to be very careful.;
,


Because guppies are live bearers, when they give birth, they give birth to actual miniature guppies instead of eggs. There are other species of live bearers which can also live with guppies because of their similarities in water quality and ways of breeding. One of these species is the ""platy"" fish, which is absolutely beautiful and extremely vibrantly colored. They are fun, hardy, cute, colorful, bright, and easy to breed, fitting the description of guppies perfectly. Swordtails are another type of live bearer fish that are also great for living with guppies. Both guppies and platys are inexpensive. However, beware: Not all live bearers are suitable tank mates for guppies! You don't want to put large mollies with guppies, for example.
Honey gouramis, as strange as it may sound, are quite compatible with guppies. They are larger in size but they don't eat guppies or nip their fins. They like peace and space and are quiet, shy, and bashful fish. They avoid fighting, aggressiveness, and breed occasionally. They are a bit more expensive than guppies and platys, but guppies and platys are dirt cheap, so you're not going to find anything at the same price of guppies and platys or cheaper. Most fish are going to be more expensive than guppies, but not by much.
Neon and cardinal tetras are also great tank mates for guppies. However, they have quite a few drawbacks: they are sensitive, do not live in newly set up aquariums, require lots of special attention, and occasionally breed. These fish are not suggested for the beginner.

, You don't necessarily have to have fish living with guppies. You can add invertebrates such as Ghost Shrimp. Ghost Shrimp are great with living for guppies-they're a natural cleanup crew and they're nice, quiet, shy, and peaceful! A hardy addition to any aquarium, these are definitely recommended.

, Guppies are top and middle dwellers-they tend to swim around the top and middle of the aquarium. It would create a wonderful, natural balance in your aquarium if you added some bottom dwellers as well. I would suggest throwing in some corydoras catfish-they're peaceful as well and just slink around the bottom without bothering any other fish.

, They aren't exactly peaceful, but the two species tend to totally ignore each other, which is what really matters-if the two species ignore each other, that's just fine. Occasionally, they will mess around with each other, but not in an aggressive way. This is typical, friendly behavior.

, There are lots of different compatible tank mates with guppies, as you can see, so you can pick the one that appeals the most to you. Do a bit of research on all of the species you are considering before adding any.

But if you monitor your guppy’s belly for several weeks and it continues to get bigger over time, your guppy is probably pregnant.Your female guppy is getting close to delivery time when the she is very large and has a boxy appearance. It takes about a month for the fry to be ready for birth.;
, It'll take a couple weeks for a gravid spot (a spot near the butt of the guppy) to appear darker. When it does darken, this will prove that your guppy is pregnant. It may be orange or dark in the beginning, but through the pregnancy it can change between these two.You can tell that your guppy is very close to having the babies when you can see little dots (the baby guppies’ eyes) in the gravid spot.

, Another major sign that your guppy is in labor is the appearance of body contractions. This will look like a tightening of the muscles on the surface of your guppy’s body and then they will become looser.This process may repeat itself many times during labor – tightening muscles, then becoming more relaxed.

, During mating encounters, the male chases the female until she's exhausted, or sneaks up on her. The male erects his anal fin, and inserts it into the female’s underbelly to inject sperm. The injection can be done simply by the male bumping the female and swimming away.Mating can occur very quickly and often happens without the owners even noticing.

, While not all of these symptoms will be experienced by every pregnant guppy, the signs are a great starting point for trying to determine if your guppy is pregnant or not. Some additional symptoms of pregnancy among guppies include:Shaking or shivering
Rubbing itself up against things in the tank – the wall, leaves, decorations
Refusal to eat

, This is one of the most common behavioral characteristics of a guppy that is about to go into labor. Your pregnant guppy will look like it is swimming, while remaining in the same spot in the tank.A guppy in labor may also try to hide from view or display certain aggressive behaviors like fin nipping.

, Remember to care for your pregnant fish properly and don't create any stress for it. During pregnancy, if the fish is stressed out, it's a possibility that she can absorb the babies/miscarry. This means that the babies will not be born.A stressful environment can harm the unborn baby guppies and ruin their chances for survival.

, Using a breeding box to safeguard your pregnant mother guppy is a great way to ensure the wellbeing of the mother and her fry. However, you have to be careful because breeding boxes can cause stress for pregnant guppies. The shorter time it's in a breeding box, the less stressed out it'll be.Breeding boxes, or net breeders, are a little chamber that hangs or sticks on the inside of your tank to isolate sick fish, aggressive fish, pregnant fish, and fry.
Breeding boxes are quite inexpensive and usually last through many uses. It’s a great investment for something that can save the life of your guppy and her fry.
You want to keep the pregnant female in the breeding box for as little time as possible to minimize stress. So watch for symptoms of labor and put her in the breeding box when she is close to having the fry.
To get the guppy in the breeding box, you can use a fishnet and gently transfer her into the breeding box.

, When your guppy is pregnant, you want to give her a well-balanced diet to ensure she doesn’t get a nutrient deficiency. This means that you should feed her a variety of food for the duration of her pregnancy.Try alternating days between regular flake food, tiny fish food pellets, algae discs, krill, bloodworms, or brine shrimp.

, Once the babies have matured in a breeding box/net breeder, or a recommended 10 gallon (and up) nursery tank, they can be returned to the main tank where the breeding box/net breeder had been placed previously for the fry to mature and be protected. This process can take up to four months. You can also choose to keep them in a different aquarium.Having a lot of babies means eventually they'll need a larger tank, for each of them will become around 2 inches (5.1 cm) long and a tank cannot be overcrowded.
When tanks are overcrowded, it creates tons of stress. This can even cause the adult guppies to eat their babies.

, You don't want the guppies or the babies to live and grow up in icky, bacteria-filled aquarium that can lead to many diseases which can cause fishy death. The water may look clear, but bacteria still grows. If the water is too warm, bacteria can grow faster.Many fish can get Ich, a rot that forms on their tails, bodies, and mouth that can kill small fish in as quickly as 24 hours, while it may take a few days to begin affecting larger fish.
To help kill bacteria that cause diseases like Ich, get an Ich/Disease treatment to put in the water.

Take proper care of the aquarium providing home to the guppy fish.,
Minimize the fluctuations in water quality.,
When you introduce new guppies into a tank, they may carry many bacteria and parasites along with them , which can infect other fish in that tank.,
Create a home like atmosphere for your guppies.,
Feeding is another most important factor which you should keep in mind while taking care of a Guppy.,
Check the equipment.,
Test the pH of your water.",How to Keep Guppies Healthy," Cleaning the guppy tank once in a while can get rid of most of the diseases and parasites that affect the guppies. Changing water regularly may help them to last longer without getting affected by diseases. Can you even think of a moment living under unclean surroundings? Guppies too cannot survive under such unclean conditions. Though it's best to change aquarium water after every fortnight, make sure you at least replace it with fresh water when it starts to get cloudy or when it gives foul smell .;
, Even though Guppies can adapt to minor fluctuations in water quality, try to make non-stressful water changes to maintain the health of Guppies. Alkaline and warm water conditions can also be considered. The perfect temperature for an aquarium sheltering guppy fish are about 72-80 Degree F.

, Therefore the best solution is to release them in a separate tank and watch them for over a month to see whether they are carrying any pathogens .

, If you can keep a guppy happy, this will be reflected in its health also. Try creating a friendly atmosphere by fixing more plants and by giving it enough room. The size of the tank should not be too small as it would make the fish feel uncomfortable. Adding coloured rocks and dead crushed coral might give pleasure to your guppies and also make your aquarium eye catchy.

, They can be fed twice or three times a day but make sure that you don't overfeed them. Supply them with their favourite food which include frozen and the flake foods. Ensure you do so, especially when their babies are in the aquarium because in the absence or scarcity of food, they are known for eating their young ones.

, Aquarium consists of lot of components such as pumps, filters etc. which are installed for the life support of fish. Malfunction of any of these components may greatly affect their health and therefore it would be best to clean them occasionally.

, pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. If the difference of pH in your water and the water of the breeder you purchased from is more than .3, the fish can become stressed. If you are quite inclined to purchase a guppy from a tank with high pH difference, gather some water from the store and also add your water into the tank till the fish gets used to your pH.

Know that when getting male and female guppies, there will be babies, and lots of them!,
Always start by cycling the tank before adding any living creatures.,
Drip acclimate your guppies for 4 to 5 hours.,
For people who aren't serious guppy breeders, a flake food enhanced with shrimp should suffice just fine.,
Enjoy your guppies!",How to Keep and Breed Fancy Guppies," However, the traditional American modernized tank is a tiny aquarium with bright gravel and stuffed with decorations. For keeping these fish healthy it is not suggested to keep them like this, let alone all their babies. Of course, most people have better tanks than this and know what they're doing. But, some beginners don't. At the very minimum a ten gallon tank should suffice for about one or two pairs of guppies. And it must be filtered and heated.;
, Plants and special additives can speed up the process. When cycling the tank aquarium salt is not a necessity but a suggestion. Fancy guppies are bred in Asia, in nearly sea water strength water. They grow big beautiful and healthy and they are fed live foods. Then they are shipped across the country, rubbing their slime coats off in the small bags, dumped in freshwater, and fed bland flake food. You can now see why fancy guppies are so delicate. Aquarium salt helps them with stress, it helps them regain needed electrolytes and regain their slime coat. This is why it is suggested. When setting up the rest of the tank, caves or over turned flower pots make a nice shelter for baby guppies and or guppies that are being picked on, in normal territorial squabbles. If you want to breed Fancy guppies for fun, fish shows, or any other reason you will need plants. Java moss is a favorite of fancy guppy fry to hide in, because Fancy guppies will eat their own young. If you don't want to end up with a million babies then get all males or all females. However, don't be surprised that if you do this they change sex and breed anyway! They have been known to do that on some occasions.

, I know some of you are like, can't we just sit the bag in the water for like an hour? In general yes if you are in a hurry you could do it the bag way. First sit the bag in the water for 30 minutes to an hour. Then scoop some of your tank water in the bag and wait another hour. Both options are fine but if you want healthy guppies drip acclamation is the way to go. Your guppies will thank you. But under no circumstances can you just dump your fish into the tank.

, However if you are looking into serious breeding you should feed your guppies un-encapsulated brine eggs for maximum coloration to show and to create top quality healthy strains. You should have either a special nursery tank for the mommy to be or a little breeding trap that clasps onto the main tank. For people who are trying to breed certain color strains, you have to separate the chosen breeding stock alone together or the female could mess up the entire strain with the wrong male. Baby guppies will readily eat powdered flake food and you can switch to un-encapsulated brine shrimp eggs if you so choose.

, Whether you are an accidental breeder, a serious one, or a beginner hobbyist who is starting out with these little jewels.

Purchase flake food made for tropical fish.,
Feed the guppies a pinch of flake food once or twice a day, preferably in the morning and at night, leaving a twelve hour difference between the two.,
Replace the occasional flake food meal with more nutritious treats.,
Avoid tubifex worms and live daphnia.,
Watch for signs of overfeeding.,
Consider feeding methods for vacations longer than one week.",How to Feed Guppies1," You can purchase flake food at a pet store or fish shop to use as a basic, daily food supply. While guppies will eat any type of flake food, high quality brands that contain both protein and vegetable matter are best. Flake food intended for tropical fish often include natural color enhancers that will make your guppies appear brighter and more colorful.Do not purchase fish food in pellet form, as this will be difficult or impossible for guppies to eat with their small mouths.


If you purchase more flake food than you will use in a month, freeze the excess to preserve nutrients. Thaw another month's supply a couple days before you need a refill.;
, Drop a tiny pinch of flakes into the water and watch the guppies eat. They should be finished with the meal in about 30–60 seconds, and certainly no longer than a few minutes.You may decide to feed them once or twice a day, as long as you do so in appropriate amounts. It is easy to feed guppies too much food, and difficult to feed them too little.


Guppies will continue to eat or search for food even when they do not need it. Do not feed your fish an additional meal because the fish appear hungry. In fact, guppies that actively seek food will prevent food debris from building up and dirtying your water.

, While guppies will survive on flake food alone, live or frozen plants and animals contain extra nutrients that are ideal for supplementing a flake food diet. Replace one flake food meal every 2–7 days with no more treats than the guppies will finish within 60 seconds. Any of the following are appropriate treats, and most can be found at fish shops:


Baby brine shrimp contain mostly protein, and are ideal supplements if your flake food is high in vegetable content and low in protein (40% or less).They are available in live, frozen, or flake form.
Blood worms or mosquito larvae are good treats that you can catch yourself by running a net through standing water. Acquire small quantities of larvae at a time to prevent them hatching into mosquitoes. Earthworms are also appropriate, but must be shredded and rinsed before feeding to the guppies.Feed your guppies shucked peas, shredded lettuce, or finely chopped cucumber, especially if their flake food is high in protein but low in vegetable content.

, Many other types of fish food exist, and fish store employees or other guppy owners may recommend other types of treat. However, you should try to avoid tubifex worms and daphnia, even if recommended to you. While guppies will eat them enthusiastically, tubifex worms sometimes contain lethal bacteria. Live daphnia will only cause harm in large quantities by removing oxygen from the tank, but they are typically more expensive and difficult to raise than other live foods., Because guppies have such small stomachs but still eat large quantities of food if available, overfeeding is common. If you notice any of the following signs, reduce the number of meals you feed them or the frequency of their treats. Some guppy owners only feed their fish 6 days a week, letting them go hungry on the seventh for their health.


Tubes of waste dangling behind the fish are a sign of a blocked intestine from overeating.Adult male guppies develop a ""potbelly"" or bulging chest if they have too much fat in their diet. Reduce the amount of food and replace fatty treats such as blood worms or beef heart with crumbs of fat-free ham.
If your tank water gets cloudy and dirty frequently, excess food or waste may be the cause. As a general rule, you should change 20–30% of the water in your tank about once every 1–2 weeks, or more frequently for crowded tanks.

, Healthy, adult guppies can last a week without food before experiencing any lasting effects, so if you are only going to be gone a few days, consider simply not feeding them. For a longer trip, one of the following methods is recommended:Use an automatic feed dispenser to dispense food at regular intervals. Make sure you supply enough food for the whole time you'll be away, and set the dispenser to release food once or twice a day.
Test a feeder block or gel feeder before leaving. These blocks of dry or gel-covered food are left in the tank and eaten slowly. However, the dry blocks may cause dangerous chemical changes, while the gel variety sometimes go ignored. Test either variety for a few days before leaving so you can be sure there are no problems.
Have a friend or neighbor feed them their usual flake food once every two or three days. Because inexperienced feeders often give too much food, it's best to place each pinch of food in a pillbox or other container with the day of the week carefully marked on it. Make it clear to the caretaker that overfeeding could kill your guppies.

Check the water quality.,
Keep the water temperature at 75-80F.,
Use a sponge filter or a very low power mechanical filter to keep water clean.,
Survey the tank setup.,
Remove the female from the breeding box promptly.,
Be sure you feed them well.,
Check for illnesses.,
Watch the fry grow.",How to Care for Baby Guppies," Guppy fry will grow fast when their water quality is good. To keep it pristine conditions use a test kit and test for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate. Keep ammonia at 0 ppm., nitrite at 0 ppm., and nitrate at less than 10 ppm. Keep doing weekly water exchanges, but exercise caution not to suck up any fry.;
, Do not let the water temperature get outside this range.

, Make sure the filter has some kind of protective sponge over the intake to prevent small fry from being sucked in.

, Guppy fry are an excellent food source for most types of fish (even their parents). Separate fry from all adult fish if possible. Placing them in their own separate tank is best, but if you do not have an extra aquarium you'll need to get a mesh ""breeding tank"". These devices go inside your existing aquarium, and serve as a holding pen for the fry or the adults. If you are going to keep the fry in this container, make sure it is mesh, otherwise they might swim out.

, When the female gets a dark gravid spot and then becomes very puffed up and blocky and starts to get an uneven look around the torso, she's full of fry and about to give birth. Place her in a breeding box, which has a divider with slots in it. The breeding box floats in the aquarium. Have it floating before you catch the female. After the female has given birth, which takes up to six hours, and she is no longer producing young, remove her from the breeding box. She can go back with the other adult fish.

If you have a separate tank for the fry, you can release them into it. (That's where they should be floating.) If not, you can remove the female and the divider from the breeding box and keep the fry in it for some time.
If you do not remove the female, she will eat any fry that find their way back up into the top part of the box.

, Baby guppies need high quality foods to grow and be healthy. When they are first born use fry food or finely crushed flake food. As they get bigger keep using flake food.

, Diseased fry have a very low chance of surviving. Remove any sick fry immediately. Do not medicate a tank with fry in it, as it is too difficult for a regular fish keeper to use the right dosage.

, Monitor their growth, and place them back into the main aquarium once they are big enough not to be eaten. This is about a fourth of an inch or more. Make sure they are all growing fairly uniformly. Once they are all big enough, release them and watch them interact with their expanded world.

Select the fish you want to breed.,
Select the breeding tank.,
Set up the tank.,
Adjust the tank for your fish’s needs.,
Place the guppies in the breeding tank.,
Know when your fish is about to give birth.,
Remove your female fish from the breeding tank once the fry have been born.,
Keep the tank clean and at a healthy temperature.,
Feed the fry the right food.,
Take steps to ensure that your fry are healthy.,
Move the fry to the normal tank when they get big enough.",How to Breed Guppies," Keep in mind the number of fish you want to breed, each fish’s coloring, and the shape of their tails. If you choose two fish to breed who have the same color patterns, the fry will also have that color pattern. The same principle applies for fin shape.


Number of fish: Generally, you will want to select one male and two or three female guppies for breeding. When there is a ratio of one to one, the male often becomes aggressive, chasing the female around the tank. With a one to three ratio, the male’s attention is split between three females, making breeding a less stressful process for the females.
Color pattern: There are several basic guppy patterns. These include Wild (grey or olive coloring), Albino (light colors or white with red eyes,) Blonde (light colors with black pigment,) and Blue (shimmering blue color.)
Tail shape: The shape of guppy tails can range from a rounded back fin to a sword-like shape. There are many different shapes and sizes that guppy tails come in, but the most common are the Delta (which is a large triangular shape,) the Fantail (which is shaped like a fan,) and the Round tail (which is a small, round shape.);
, You should select a 10 to 20 gallon tank with a heater and a gentle filter. You want the filter to be gentle because otherwise the baby guppies (which are called fry) could be sucked up the filter and killed. If you think your filter is too strong, cover the opening of the filter with sheer tights. The tights will allow the water to be filtered but will also protect the fry.

, Sadly, guppy parents can turn rather cannibalistic so you will need to provide the fry with hiding places for after they are born. Guppy fry tend to sink, so use low-floating plants for their cover. Some high cover is also required as healthy fry will swim upwards.Do not use any substrate. Substrate are the rocks/imitation rocks used to cover the bottoms of fish tanks. A bare bottom tank is good for fry as it cleans easily and you can record how many fry are alive or how much they eat.
Java moss or spawning moss provides a nice hiding spot for guppy fry.

, Set the temperature to around 77-79 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 26.11 C) while the females and male are in the tank together. Before you place the guppies in the breeding tank, purchase food with a higher nutritional value in order to promote healthy breeding.

, At this point, all you can do is wait for your fish to breed. Place the male back in the regular tank when you notice that your female(s) are pregnant. You can tell whether a female fish is pregnant or not by looking to see if there is a dark mark on her abdomen. This mark is called a gravid spot. All female fish will develop this when pregnant, but it becomes noticeably darker when the eggs have been fertilized., Generally, the gestation period will take 26 to 31 days. When your female guppy is ready to give birth, her stomach will be very large and her gravid spot will be a deep black (or dark maroon if you are breeding albino or blond guppies.) Her stomach will also square off like a cardboard box rather than growing rounder. Be prepared for the fact that guppies give birth to live babies and not eggs. You will have to monitor your pregnant female closely so that you are there when she gives birth so that you can remove her from the tank immediately after (she may eat her babies otherwise.)


Some signs of a fish going into labor are: being very still and secluding herself, shivering (contractions), hanging out near the heater, or a change in appetite (including refusing to eat, or spitting her food out.)

, While this may seem like a cruel practice, guppy fry are actually born fully prepared to survive on their own. Also, as stated about, mother guppies can occasionally become cannibalistic and will eat their babies.If you are not able to be there when your female gives birth, make sure to provide the fry lots of aquarium plants to hide in.

, Fry need to live in a tank that is around 78 degrees F (25.5 degrees C.) Keep your tank at this temperature until the fry are fully grown. The tank will also need to be cleaned often. Siphon the tank carefully every time it gets too dirty and do 40% water changes every few days to keep the water clean.

, Guppy fry eat brine shrimp, micro-worms or powdered flakes. They should be fed twice a day. Guppies enjoy both meat and vegetables. You should feed your guppies vegetable flakes, as well as standard flakes. Remember that fry are tiny and if you place too much food in the tank, the excess food that goes bad while sitting in the water could make your fry sick, or even kill them.Newborn fry should be fed recently hatched brine shrimp so that the guppies reach their greatest growth potential. If you want to give you guppies a treat, place a small amount of boiled spinach in their tank.

, This means removing any fry that have died. Dead fry will float to the top of the tank, making it easy to scoop them up. Keep track of how many fry die. If you notice that there is a high amount of fry death, you will want to figure out what is killing them. Change the water and switch to a different type of food. Any accumulated waste is bad for guppy health.

, When the fry are a good size, or about a month and a half to two months old, they will be ready to fend for themselves outside of the breeding tank. You can put them into your normal tank with non-aggressive fish, sell them to your local pet store, or give them to friends as gifts.

Choose an aquarium tank.,
Dechlorinate the water in the tank.,
Keep the water between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Use a filtration system in your tank.,
Add plants and decorations to your tank.,
Light your tank.,
Feed your guppies the right food.,
Feed your guppies a small amount 2-4 times per day.,
Monitor your guppies’ digestive health.,
Keep two or three female guppies for every one male guppy.,
Clean the tank once a week.,
Purchase a siphon hose from your pet supply store.,
Monitor your guppies for illness or disease.",How to Care for Guppies," Ideally, your tank will be between 5 and 10 gallons in volume. You don’t want to overcrowd your tank. For best results, stick to 1 inch of fish per gallon of water. If you have a 10-gallon tank, for example, aim for about five guppies. This will simply help you maintain the tank better and keep your fish healthier.Some guppy breeders and enthusiasts might argue that you don’t need to follow that ratio, but the more fish you have in your tank, the more often you will have to clean it and change the water. Consider this when deciding what size tank to get, and how many guppies to keep in it.;
, There are a few ways you can dechlorinate your water. You can let it sit with the lid open for about a week to let the chlorine evaporate, or you can buy a dechlorinating kit. It’s important to dechlorinate your aquarium, and any water you add to it in the future.You can buy these supplies at a local pet supply store for a relatively low cost. You will also want to buy a chlorine testing kit, just to make sure the water is completely free of chlorine before adding your fish.
Nearly all tap water has a certain level of chlorine in it. You can use purified, filtered, or distilled water that is free of chlorine, to begin with, but to be safe, still test the water for chlorine before putting your fish in it.Try to keep the pH level in your tank between 6.8 and 7.8, with 7.0 being the ideal level. You can use a pH testing kit to monitor this level.

, This is equal to about 24 and 30 degrees Celsius. Keep a thermometer in the tank to monitor the temperature. If you find it needs to be heated, you can purchase a small heater to place in the tank.If you need a heater, make sure you buy one that is appropriate for the size of aquarium you have. For example, if you have a 5-gallon tank, you’ll need a less powerful heater than if you have a 20-gallon tank. Ask the associate at the pet supply store if you aren’t sure which heater you need.
To avoid overheating your tank, it’s best to keep it out of direct sunlight. Use a heater if you need to raise the temperature, and use an artificial light in the tank rather than sunlight. If for some reason the water becomes overheated, take some of the warm water out and replace it with cooler water to lower the temperature slowly.

, For the most part, aquarium tanks will come equipped with a filtration system. If yours did not, you would need to purchase one separately. You will need to change the filter media when it begins to turn brown, so make sure you monitor this whenever you clean the tank.Even if your tank did come with a filter, you can always change it out for a different or better one should you feel you need to. Make sure your filtration system can keep up with the amount of fish you have and the size of your tank.
A regular filtration system should be enough to keep your tank oxygenated, but you can also add an airstone to help add oxygen to the water if you have a larger tank.
You should keep the tank set up and working for a month without any fish, just avoid the temptation of buying any fish before. The bacteria are in the media part of the filter (where bacteria develop) and clean out the toxic substances that are dissolved in our water, as fish contaminate their own water by excreting. These substances aren't removed by the mechanical system of the filter, only bacteria can transform these highly toxic substances in others much less toxic, that can be removed by changing weekly part of the water. In this month feed the bacteria with some fish food (1 flake each three days), in order to train them for when the fish come. This whole process is called cycling.

, Start from the bottom—add some substrate to the bottom of the tank. Stones or gravel are a great option for guppies. Then, add in plants. You should use live plants, as they take an important part that, along with the bacterias, will help with the toxic substances. The other important thing is that the fish have somewhere to hide, as guppies like to do this.Make sure you rinse all substrate and decorations before placing them in the water. You want to make sure you get all the dust or dirt off of them that they may have picked up in the supply store.
Avoid adding things taken from the nature, as clams, roots, sand, because they might contain parasites or will modify your pH (or the general hardness if adding calcareous stones) This may lead to illnesses in your fish or even their death. It's better if you buy them in your pet store, these way you avoid unpleasant surprises. Only those who have experience in keeping fish would pick things from the nature, as they difference between roots and rocks (making a previous study on them and getting some information in advance) which are innocuous to the water quality and those who are not.

, Ideally, your guppies should get about 8 hours of darkness per day. Too much more or less than this could cause deformities as they grow. You can put a light over the tank and set it on a timer to ensure your guppies get the right amount of light per day, or you can turn the light on and off manually each morning and night.If you are using natural light, like placing your tank near a window or light source, make sure it doesn’t affect the temperature of the water too much. Make sure your water maintains the proper temperature for your guppies. Doing this might lead to algae problem, so it's better to put artificial light.

, You can feed your guppies all kinds of food, both dry and wet, and both live and frozen. You can buy pre-made flake food for guppies that will provide them with a balanced diet, but make sure you avoid feeding them solely a high-protein food. You want to balance protein with vegetable-based food.Brine shrimp, earthworm flakes, dried bloodworm, white worms, and mosquito larvae are all great options for feeding your guppies.
Flake food with fish meal as a primary ingredient is a great choice. Read the labels before buying your guppy food.

, Rather than feeding your guppies a large amount all at once, spread their feedings out throughout the day. Try to vary what you give them each feeding. For example, you might give them live brine shrimp during one feeding, and then flake food at the next feeding.Be careful not to overfeed your guppies. They should be able to consume the food you give them within two minutes.

, The tank water is a good indicator of how well the fish are thriving on their diet. If the water goes cloudy, or if there seems to be a problem with algae in your tank, you might be having some issues with your feeding.If your tank goes cloudy, lighten up your feeding by about 20% for a few days and see if that helps the fish readjust and the water to balance itself out again. If this happens it might be due to a peak of toxic substances (ammonia and nitrite) because of skipping the cycling period...

, You will want to keep multiple guppies in your tank, because they are social fish who enjoy being in groups. Make sure you keep a 2:1 ratio of females to males as males have a tendency to stress out the females and chase them around in the tank. Keeping more females than males should help lessen this issue.If you want to avoid breeding, you will want to keep all one gender in your tank. Guppies give birth to live fry rather than laying eggs, so if your guppies breed, you will see their babies right as they are born.
Learn more about breeding guppies before doing so.

, This will mean changing out about 25% of the water and replacing it with fresh, dechlorinated water. You will also want to use a siphon hose to reach down to the bottom of the tank and vacuum up any leftover food, or algae that might be growing on the bottom of the tank.When cleaning, you won’t want to take out all of the water and replace it. By taking out only 25-40% of the water, the fish will be better able to adjust.Your filter should be doing most of the heavy lifting on a daily basis, but using a siphon hose (easily purchased at a pet supply store) to clean any algae or food from the bottom of the tank will help keep the tank cleaner, and your fish healthier.
Clean the glass on the inside of the tank if you notice it’s getting dirty. Use a razor blade to scrape off any grime that might be on the inside of the tank, then use the siphon hose to suck it up. Also, you may want to periodically remove any decorations from the tank and rinse them thoroughly to remove any algae or grime build-up.

, You can use these while the fish are still in the tank, but make sure you do so with care. If you’re worried about the fish being harmed during the tank cleaning, you can remove them and put them in a separate container of dechlorinated water while you clean.

, While this particular species is pretty healthy, guppies may sometimes develop problems with fungus. This most commonly appears as white spots on their skin called ich. This is easily treatable with some medications you can purchase at your pet supply store.Keep your tank clean and well-maintained, and you will likely not have any issues with sickness or disease. If any guppies die, make sure you remove them quickly from the tank. If any guppies do show signs of disease or sickness, quarantine them in a separate tank while they heal so they don’t infect the others.
Some people recommend that you add a bit of aquarium salt to the water to prevent fungus. If you add any tank mates, make sure they can tolerate this (for example, corydoras cannot). Marine salt and cooking salt are not the same things.

Prepare a separate breeding tank.,
Divide your breeding tank into two sections using a breeding net.,
Move pregnant females to the breeding tank until they give birth.,
Prepare special food for your fry.,
Feed the fry several times a day.,
Change small amounts of water frequently.,
Reduce the frequency of their feedings gradually.",How to Feed Guppies2," Young guppies, also known as ""fry"", require special feeding separate from the adults, and should be separated for their safety as well.Prepare a 5 gallon (20 L) tank with care, making sure it has everything necessary for the guppies' survival. As with any aquarium, running a fishless cycle is an excellent way to prepare the tank before you introduce any fish.

, Purchase a breeding net or mesh from a fish store that divides the tank into two sections. The newly hatched guppies will be able to swim through the holes of the net and escape the mother fish, which may try to eat them.


If you don't want to purchase a net or are not sure if the net you have has the right sized holes, you may protect the fry by planting several aquarium plants for them to hide in.

, Females have a dark spot on their abdomen, also called a gravid spot, which becomes much darker once her internal eggs have been fertilized. The eggs will grow inside her for 21–30 days, and her abdomen will become larger and darker as this happens.Transfer the female back to the main tank as soon as you notice she has given birth, so she does not compete with the fry for food or attempt to eat her young.


If you are breeding guppies to sell or to produce specific traits, move the male and female you wish to breed into the tank before the female is pregnant. Return the male to the main tank once you notice the darker gravid spot. Note that female guppies can store sperm for months, so a fish you purchased as an adult may be fertilizing her eggs with a male not present in your tank for the first several litters.

, Guppy fry have tiny mouths and high protein requirements, so they must be fed separately from the adults. Have their special food ready to go before the fry are born, and include both protein sources and vegetable matter. High quality protein can be supplied in the form of baby brine shrimp (not adult), microworms, finely chopped beef heart, and/or a mash of egg yolk and water.Vegetable matter can be used in smaller quantities, and can take the form of infusoria (microscopic organisms that color pond water green), fresh and finely chopped dark green lettuce, or small pieces of boiled spinach.Do not to feed them adult brine shrimp until they have grown into juveniles; if the shrimp remains untouched it is too big for the fry to eat.

, Growing fry have greater energy needs than adult guppies as well as smaller stomachs, so feed them tiny amounts of food about 6 times daily.If the water grows dirty or cloudy despite frequent water changes, reduce the amount of food and make sure it is small enough for them to eat.

, Once your fry have been born, you may wish to change 10% or less of the water every couple days, instead of doing a larger and more stressful water change every week or two.Young fish are especially vulnerable to water changes, and the high frequency of feeding can cause waste to build up in the tank quickly.

, After about 2 months, the fry should be considerably larger and will only need to be fed 3–4 times a day.After about 4–5 months, they can be switched to an adult diet and fed 1–2 times a day. You may choose to alter the diet slowly to increase the odds of the fry accepting flakes, gradually replacing other parts of the diet with flake food. Different varieties and individuals will grow at different rates, however, and you should not move the fry into a tank with adult fish until they are close to the same size.


You may be able to switch to larger food such as adult brine shrimp earlier if your guppies are growing at a good rate. Keep feeding the juveniles high quality food, however, and watch them to make sure they eat the new food.

Choose the right size tank.,
Maintain an appropriate pH level.,
Add appropriate vegetation to the tank.,
Get the tank at the proper temperature.,
Select the right foods for your angelfish.,
Observe your angelfish to determine how much to feed it.,
Clean out the filter each week.,
Change the tank water once a month.,
Use caution when placing angelfish with other fish.,
Watch for signs of disease.,
Quarantine sick angelfish.",How to Care for an Angelfish," Even if your angelfish is small now, it will grow. Angelfish can grow to be about 6 inches long and 8 inches tall. When selecting a tank, make sure it's at least 20 gallons in capacity. If you can afford a tank bigger than this, and fit it in your home, bigger is always preferred.Even if your angelfish does not grow to be very big, it's always better to have more space than necessary.;
, You can measure the pH of your tank using a home testing kit, which you can purchase at most pet stores or online. You should wait 24 hours to test tap water, as the pH will change once it's been exposed to the air. Angelfish require a pH level between 6 and 8.If you need to raise your pH level, this can be done in several ways. Add crushed coral, which can raise the pH level. You can also add baking soda, shells, and chemical buffers sold at pet stores.If you need to lower pH levels, adding wood to the tank can help. You can also buy a chemical buffer made to lower pH.

, Angelfish prefer a tank with a lot of substrate and vegetation. Decorate the tank appropriately to keep your angelfish happy.Rocks and hiding places are important for angelfish. Stop by your local pet store and pick out a variety of tank decorations.
Try to add things like floating drift wood, as this reflects an angelfish's natural environment. Also, plants that stand vertically are great for an angelfish tank.

, Angelfish thrive at a temperature between 75 and 84 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 29 degrees Celsius). You will probably have to install a heating system to keep the tank at this level. You can buy a heating system online or at your local pet store. Follow the instructions to set up the system and make sure the water is at the appropriate temperature.You should keep a thermometer in the tank. If the water gets too hot or too cold, adjust your heater accordingly.

, Angelfish eat a diet primarily composed of meat products. Their main diet should be composed of cichlid flakes and pellets. However, supplement the diet with live foods. Angelfish may enjoy things like brine shrimp, white worms, bloodworms, meal worms, as well as small insects and crustaceans., How much you feed your angelfish depends on a variety of factors, such as the fish's size or environment. You will have to observe your fish's eating habits and behaviors. There will be a trial and error period before you figure out precisely how much to feed your fish. You will also have to adjust feeding amounts as your fish grows.Younger angelfish will need more live foods than older ones. As you angelfish age, you can feed them more pellets and flakes than live foods.
For general guidelines, younger angelfish need to eat 3 to 4 times a day. After they grow to full size, however, cut back the amount of food and stick to a strict schedule. Angelfish will overeat and become overweight if fed too much., You need to make sure your angelfish's tank is clean. Each week, detach and clean out the tank filter. This will keep the tank from becoming contaminated, preventing your fish from becoming infected or ill due to bacteria.Use one to two cups of the existing tank water to clean the filter's sponge. Remove the water from the tank. Then, unplug the filter and remove it from the tank.Wash any gunk or grime from the filter. You should wear gloves, as the filter will be slimy. Then, use any leftover water in your bowl to give the filters and tubes from the filter a good scrub.
You can then reassemble the filter and place it back in the tank.

, At least once a month, you will have to replace the water. You do not need to replace all the water in the tank. Instead aim to replace around 10-25% of the tank's water each month.You may have to adjust temperature and pH levels after changing the water.

, Angelfish may not do well with other fish. They tend to be territorial, and may attack and even eat smaller fish. If you introduce other fish, stick to other angelfish or fish of a similar size., If an angelfish becomes diseased, you will need to talk to a vet or a pet store worker about treating the illness. This is especially important if you have other fish in your tank. One sick fish could infect the tank.Excessive slime and clamped fins can be a sign of a very serious disease called angelfish virus. If you suspect your fish has the virus, it may need to be put to sleep as there is no cure.
White chalky feces, a lack of appetite, and weight loss can also indicate disease.
There is also a common disease called ich that causes white spotting due to parasites. It can be treated easily with medication, so keep ich medication on hand when you have angelfish., If an angelfish is showing signs of disease, remove it immediately and place it in a quarantine tank. Seek the care of a veterinarian to discuss treatment options or ask at a local pet store. Do not put the fish back into the tank until the signs of disease have passed, as you do not want disease to spread."
"
Wait until the angelfish are mature.,
Observe the tubes that come down from their undersides.,
Determine the genders based on the shape of the tubes.",How to Tell the Gender of an Angelfish1," In order for angelfish to become mature and be able to mate, they need to be properly cared for and given adequate space. If they are cared for and given the right amount of space, they may reach maturity as early as 5 to 7 months of age. At this time, they will be mature enough to breed and spawn.Adequate space would be about 7-10 gallons of water per angelfish. Sometimes, though, even with the best care and the right amount of space, certain strains of angelfish might take longer to mature.;
, Once the angelfish are mature, you will notice that small tube-like appendages have emerged on their bellies. These tubes will be just behind the “feeler” fins on their bellies. You might notice them more if other fish in the tank are breeding.These tubes are very small, so you will need to look closely to notice them. Catching the fish in a net or putting them in a smaller tank temporarily for observation purposes might help you get a better look, just make sure you handle the fish carefully.

, Once you’ve located the tube and can examine it adequately, look at the shape of the tube. On male angelfish, the tube will be pointy and narrow. It might look something like the tip of a sharpened pencil. With female angelfish, the tube will be more round and have a cylindrical shape.If you happen to have another breeding pair, you can put the angelfish you want to sex in with them. This might encourage them to drop their tubes for you to be able to tell their gender.

"
"
Set up a freshwater aquarium large enough to prepare breeding angelfish.,
Test the pH of your water.,
Set the water temperature.,
Put a good filter in your aquarium.,
Feed your angelfish properly.,
Sex your angels to isolate a breeding pair.,
Use other common characteristics to sex your angelfish.,
Alternately, purchase a breeding pair.,
If keeping more than two angelfish, wait for breeding males and females to pair off.,
Isolate any breeding pairs in a separate spawning tank.,
Wait for your breeding pair to spawn.,
If all else fails, pair the angels up with different mates.,
Let the angelfish rear their own fry if desired.,
Raise the fry artificially if you need to.,
Wait for the fry to hatch after about 60 hours in 80° F. At this stage, they'll be simple wrigglers, and won't need to eat anything.",How to Breed Angelfish," Try to choose a tank that is at least 20 gallons (75.7 L) (75.7 l) and ideally 29+ gallons large. Your angelfish pair will do best with plenty of space. In cramped quarters, angelfish won't feel secure and will fail to breed.


Try also to place the angelfish in a tank that is tall. Mature angelfish can grow up to a foot long from their dorsal to their anal fin, meaning you'll want to accommodate their unusual length.;
, In their natural habitat, freshwater angels live in soft water that's slightly acidic. For best results, make sure that their aquarium water has a pH of between 4.7 and 8.7, with the ideal range being 6.5 and 6.9.Angelfish are relatively hardy when it comes to pH and tolerate a wide range of water conditions, but you want to try to shoot for this happy medium in order to produce a contented breeding pair.


If your water isn't in the ideal pH range, a de-ionization filter or reverse osmosis (R.O.) filter can do the trick. These are usually attached to your main water supply, and can run from fairly cheap to incredibly expensive. They are, however, effective.
Try not to use chemicals to alter pH if at all possible. Chemical pH solutions alter the alkalinity or acidity of the water much too drastically, something your angels are sensitive to. Angels may fail to breed or, worse, die off if the pH swings too drastically from one extremely to another.

, Again, because angelfish are very accommodating fish, they tolerate a pretty wide range of temperatures. But they do thrive when the water temperature is right in their wheelhouse, between 72° and 82° F (22° and 27° C), with 80° F being a good target.Keep in mind the tradeoffs of different water temperatures. Warmer water is arguably better for angels' immune systems, whereas colder water increases their lifespan.

, Angelfish are ideally suited to strong currents, so be careful about using a high flow filter, which could tire them out unnecessarily.Better to use a sponge filter, gravel filter, or both — that way, your angels will have energy for love and their small fry won't be sucked up into the filter when they hatch.


Do at least 20% water change each week either as part of regular cleaning activity.

, Angels typically aren't very picky eaters, but they do enjoy their fresh foods and generally have very robust appetites. Shoot to feed your angels at least two or three times a day, being careful not to overfeed them.


Give your angels 3 to 5 minutes to feed on any food you give them. Any food that hasn't been eaten after 5 minutes should be removed from the tank to promote clean water.
If introducing a new kind of food to your angels, don't feed them at all for one or two days. Then, when you do introduce the new food, provide enough for one or two bites, supplemented with regular food. This should be enough to get them excited about the new kind of food.
A regular diet may consist mainly of dried flake food, supplemented with brine shrimp and blood worms. Live food, apart from brine shrimp, isn't recommended for angels because of the chance of disease.

, Sexing young angelfish (body size is smaller than a quarter) is next to impossible, so don't even bother. With more mature angelfish, sex can be distinguished by looking at the tubes of the vent. With males, the tube is smaller, pointy, almost triangular. Female tubes are larger and square, like an eraser on a pencil., Looking at the tubes of the fish is the single most reliable way of sexing. But taken together, other characteristics can help you determine the sex of an angel. Just remember not to cue in on any single characteristic when sexing — look at the whole picture.


Females tend to be more round while males tend to be more angular.
Female Dorsals are held slightly backward, while male dorsals are fully upright, at almost a 90 degree angle to the head bump.
Females tend to hold Ventrals closer to body, while males hold ventrals more erect
Females have a more smoothly sloped head, whereas males often have a distinct bump on their heads.

, If you're not sure whether you're dealing with males or females, it can be useful to simply purchase a breeding pair. When you do this, make sure they are younger and have proven to breed good fry. This is more expensive than sexing your own, but often it's a more reliable and efficient way of breeding quickly.

, This may take 6 to 7 months, or even longer for angels that are wilder or weaker. In a large tank, you'll notice one male and one female essentially pairing off, sending away on bothersome third party. Wait a day or two just to make sure the pair is really a pair.

, Make sure that the water chemistry is the same as the tank they were just in. Angels feel more secure and in the mood for procreation when left to themselves. Put them in at least a 20 gallon (75.7 L) tall tank that's elevated so that you move by the tank at your chest- or eye-level. This will create fewer distractions, and ultimately, a happier couple.


In the spawning tank, provide a surface for the angels to deposit their eggs on. A spawning cone, spawning mop, or simply a piece of slate are items breeders often choose. Angels have also been known to lay their eggs directly on the water filter, for example.

, Sometimes, breeding pairs spawn only days after being transferred to the spawning tank. In other cases, it can take several weeks of waiting and a little bit of prodding for them to feel comfortable enough to produce fry. Here are some things you can do to encourage breeding:


Raise the temperature a few degrees if it's currently under 80° F.
Do a 75% water change, being careful to condition the water and make sure the pH and softness of the water is close to what the angels are accustomed to.
Feed them a bit more than usual with high-quality freeze dried food.
Give them more security by adding additional plants, spawning mops, or other fibrous, decontaminated props.
Try a larger aquarium if your tank is at or below the 20 gallon (75.7 L) mark.
Place another angelfish or another breeding pair close to, but still separate from, their aquarium. Sometimes, the sight of another angelfish will get them breeding.

, If you've waited in vain for your breeding pair to do the deed, and you've tried all of the above suggestions, it may be time to play matchmaker again. There's a good chance the breeding pair isn't actually compatible, and you'll want to find a different mate for each fish. Try placing them back into a bigger aquarium and wait for them to pair off with other mates.

, Angelfish normally care for their own spawn so leave them to it once they have spawned and disturb them as little as possible. Any form of undue stress or unexpected routine can cause the angelfish to start to eat their own fry.


As the breeding pair raises their fry, continue feeding the breeding pair as before, taking note that they may not be as hungry. Remove any unwanted or uneaten food immediately after feeding and take pains to ensure the water quality is high and uncontaminated.
Occasionally you get a pair of angels that eat their fry. When this happens, you have no alternative but to remove the cone or slate with the eggs to another tank containing identical water and raise them artificially.

, Transfer the fry to a clean 1 gallon (3.8 L) tank with an airline feeding medium-sized bubbles into the water. Treat the 100% filtered water with a fungicide, then with Acriflavin, an antibacterial. Transfer the fry on the spawning slate or mop so that it's facing the bottom of the tank and close to the airline. Consider keeping the tank in the dark to prohibit the harmful growth of bacteria.

, After 5 days in this stage, they become free-swimming and will start to need food (brine shrimp work well). Small, frequent feedings are best. After the fry begin to swim in a cloud, they should be transferred to a medium sized (2.5 gallon to a 10 gallon) tank.

Set it up at least 3 months in advance to make sure the conditions are ideal. A 20 gallon tank is best because Angelfish need a tall tank to accommodate their large size.


If an Angelfish feels cramped, they will not feel secure and will not spawn.;
, Angelfish require clean water that’s not high in nitrites or ammonia for successful breeding. Using one or two sponge filters can rid the water of these.


The sponge filter also doesn’t trap fry, the fledgling fish, like some other filters.
Clean the sponge filter every couple of weeks to keep the tank water in the best condition., Though very adaptable, most Angelfish do best in soft water that’s slightly acidic to neutral with a pH of about 6.5 to 7.If your water is too hard, use a de-ionization filter. If your water is too alkaline, use a reverse osmosis filter. Either of these filters can be obtained at an aquarium supply store.

, Put an aquarium heater at each end of the tank to ensure the correct temperature. Set the heat to 78 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 29 degrees Celsius) for optimal breeding conditions., Make sure to include several plants and some driftwood in the tank, so the Angelfish will have places to hide and feel secure., Angelfish prefer a spawning slate or terracotta flower pot on which to lay their eggs. Place the slate at a 30 degree angle against the tank wall for optimal results.Place several spawning slates around the tank to give your Angelfish options.

, Angelfish will feel more secure in a dim environment, so arrange for natural light and make the tank darker by painting the outside bottom of the tank a black matte. This cuts down on reflection, which will make the Angelfish feel more secure.Instead of overhead lights in the room, use plant lights., In order to prepare for establishing a mating pair of Angelfish, get a 55 gallon or larger sized aquarium. An aquarium of this size will allow the Angelfish enough space to comfortably live.

Use a filter to keep the tank clean.
Make sure the water temperature stays between 78 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 29 degrees Celsius) with a water heater.
Keep the pH level between 6.5 and 7.
Line the bottom of the tank with sand and add large water plants. Also include driftwood for the fish., Since Angelfish prefer to choose their own mate, you’ll have the most successful breeding experience if you obtain 6 to 12 juvenile Angelfish and let them choose their own mates. Choose fish that have good shape, finnage, and color to produce the best results for reproduction.Because it’s near impossible to tell the sex of Angelfish, you can’t know what sexes you’re getting. If you get somewhere between 6 to 12 Angelfish, chances are you’ll have enough of each sex for the Angelfish to find a mate they prefer.
When choosing a quality Angelfish, look for a body that’s round and taller than it is wide. Because Angelfish fins are the hallmark of the species, the best fins are straight and free of curves or blemishes. Coloration of the Angelfish is difficult to assess since it’s often based on environment or stress levels. However, be aware of a lack of color or dullness., When your Angelfish is 6 to 12 months old they’ll reach sexual maturity, and you should begin looking for signs of them pairing off. You can tell that two Angelfish have paired by observing your fish and seeing which ones are staying close together and displaying territorial behavior.Pairs of Angelfish will often claim a section of the tank as their own and chase off others who come near.If you think you’ve identified a pair, watch them for 1 or 2 days until you’re certain.

, Once you’ve identified your pair, remove them to the spawning tank, as they’ll spawn more successfully when isolated. This ensures that they do not spawn in the larger tank with the other fish, who might eat the eggs or fry.Because the spawning tank will have similar conditions to the 55 gallon tank you can transition the Angelfish quickly. Place the Angelfish in a bag of water from the 55 gallon tank, and put this bag in the spawning tank for an hour. Then you can open the bag and allow the fish to swim out., Once you’ve relocated your paired Angelfish to the spawning tank, begin feeding them more heavily than you had before. Try feeding them about three to four times a day. An increase in food consumption induces breeding in Angelfish.Feed Angelfish bloodworms, frozen brine shrimp, white worms, or a beef heart mixture.Remove any uneaten food after 3 to 5 minutes to help keep the water clean., Angelfish require clean water to breed successfully, and because of the increased feedings, the tank water will need more frequent replacing. Change out at least 30% of the water once a week.

It’s even better to change out out 30% of the water daily., Usually within 5 to 8 days of being placed in the spawning tank, your Angelfish will be ready to breed. The female Angelfish’s belly will swell and a papilla, an organ between the ventral and anal fin, will appear on both the male and the female.


The female’s papilla is larger than the male’s, which is how you can tell the sexes of Angelfish apart., Because the Angelfish are captive, they might not retain all of their wild parenting instincts. After the eggs are laid and the male fertilizes them, you need to watch to see if the Angelfish fan the eggs with their fins. If not, this means the eggs aren’t getting the air circulation they need. You should turn the spawning slate upside down to increase a good flow of water.If using a flower pot, you can remove the eggs entirely from the tank and place them in another tank with the same pH and water temperature as the spawning tank., It may take the Angelfish a few tries at breeding to be successful. Sometimes Angelfish will eat their eggs or sometimes the eggs don’t hatch. Angelfish breed as often as every 7 to 10 days, so be patient and let them try again., About 3 to 4 days after the eggs were laid they’ll hatch and wiggle, still attached to the slate. After an additional five days, the fry will detach from the slate and begin free-swimming., After you notice the fry free-swimming in a cloud, it’s time to begin feeding them up to six times a day. Feed them with newly hatched brine shrimp or micro-worms., After one or two days of feeding the fry, remove the parent Angelfish from the spawning aquarium, and reintroduce them to your 55 gallon tank with the rest of your Angelfish., Around two weeks of age, the fry will begin taking on the shape of an Angelfish. At this point they’ll begin needing more food and you can feed them as you feed your adult Angelfish.Feed them twice a day only what they can eat in three minutes.

Perform fishless cycling before putting any fish in!,
Choose a bigger aquarium if you want to have more than one male.,
Make sure your aquarium has a lot of plants.,
Consider a tank with an open top.,
Don't get shrimps!,
Choose appropriate tank-mates.,
Keep the current slow.,
Remember their range of water conditions.,
Before getting your fish, ask the person working at the fish shop to tell you what water conditions the sparkling gouramis are living in.,
Try to acclimatize them by the 'drip method' as this is the most successful in most cases.

",How to Care for Sparkling Gouramis (Trichopsis Pumila)," This could be a matter of life or death, as too much ammonia/nitrite/nitrate can be fatal for any fish.;
, Males are territorial and like to claim areas as their own, so a big aquarium will allow more space for more territories. Sparkling gouramis are one of the most, if not the most, peaceful gourami and will likely not fight most of the time. In the breeding season, however, male sparkling gouramis can become very aggressive with each other and, very rarely, could beat each other to death.

, Due to sometimes aggressive nature between two or more males and in the breeding season, sparkling gouramis feel safer when they have a lot of places to hide. They also love to explore, and are very interesting to watch as they venture into every little nook and cranny.

, Open top tanks can look amazing with floating plants (which sparkling gouramis love for making bubble nests and hiding/exploring) or plants growing out from the tank; sparkling gouramis are unlikely to jump out like some fish as they are mainly bottom dwellers, only coming up for air. It also helps make sure that more air is present above the surface of water for the gouramis, as they are labyrinth fish.

, Sparkling gouramis are notorious shrimp hunters, and have been known to go around in 'gangs' picking off shrimps. However, some people have been able to keep the two together, but it is not advised.

, Sparkling gouramis can live with a range of peaceful shoaling or non-shoaling fish. Tetras, peaceful algae eaters (like otos) and minnows/danios are examples of suitable tank-mates; however, black widow tetras are known fin-nippers. Sparkling gouramis should not go with other species of gourami or other aggressive, territorial fish.

, Sparkling gouramis originate from slow moving rivers, ponds, marshes and rice paddies of Southeast Asia and appreciate shade from floating plants. They are labyrinth fish (like the well-known betta/siamese fighting fish) this means they need little or no oxygen from the water, so they don't need water agitation from a pump, airstone or filter. However, this doesn't mean that you don't have to install a filter.

, They can live in temperatures ranging from 25 – 28°C (77 – 82.5°F) , slightly acidic to neutral water pH (6.0 - 7.0) and have a dH range of 5 - 19, preferring soft water.

, This will allow you to try make your tank very similar to the fish shop's tank so acclimatizing them will be easier.

Look for a large crowned head on male angelfish.,
Check for a smaller, more rounded shape on female angelfish.,
Watch them as they swim towards you.",How to Tell the Gender of an Angelfish2," On a male, the front of their heads will have a high, noticeable crown. It will likely look much more prominent and a bit larger than the female angelfish.This feature might be more prominent at maturity, but you may be able to notice it earlier on in the lifespan, as well.This isn’t a surefire way to tell the difference between the genders. In some strains of angelfish, this physical difference might not always be present.

, Female angelfish might have more rounded bodies than males. Female angelfish are also generally a little smaller than male angelfish. If you want to buy pairs to breed, try buying a few smaller angelfish and a few larger angelfish. Once they’re mature, you’ll more than likely find out you have a few males and a few females.On female angelfish, the line from their dorsal fin to their eyes also tends to be a bit straighter than that of the male’s.

, Sometimes with female angelfish, you might be able to notice a difference when they swim towards you. The shape of their bellies might be a bit bigger or wider than male angelfish. Try looking into the tank and waiting for each of the fish to swim towards the glass. Observe the shape of their bellies from that angle."
"
Put a group of about 4-6 angelfish together.,
Watch their spawning habits.,
Determine which angelfish are male and female based on pairings.",How to Tell the Gender of an Angelfish3," When purchasing your first set of angelfish, consider buying 4-6 different juvenile fish and putting them together in a tank. Make sure the tank has adequate space for all the fish. When selecting your fish, consider picking a few fish that are on the smaller side, and a few that are a little larger. This might increase your chances of them being different genders and eventually pairing to spawn., Once the fish are mature—usually once they are between 6 and 12 months old—they will pair off to spawn. At this time, start keeping a close eye on them to see their behaviors. Not only will you be more likely to see their spawning tubes at that point, but you will be able to see which fish pair off to spawn together.


Observe these behaviors carefully, though—sometimes fish of the same gender will try to spawn, unsuccessfully of course.
Sometimes spawning pairs of angelfish will “kiss” or lock lips. Sometimes this lip locking can be quick and cute, or even a little aggressive, with the fish chasing one another around the tank., Once your fish have paired to spawn, you should be able to determine which fish are female and which are male based on their pairings. This might not be the most efficient way to tell the gender of an angelfish, but since the sexing of angelfish is an imprecise process, it’s one of the most accurate.You may actually observe a female angelfish laying her eggs with careful observation. Keep in mind, though, that even some of the most experienced angelfish breeders and keepers have trouble distinguishing the genders.

Know your fish!,
Get a heater.,
Choose tank mates!,
Provide decorations.,
Give them the appropriate diet!,
Acclimate your new fish.",How to Care for a Pearl Gourami," Pearl gouramis usually grow to about 4""-5"" and have a very vibrant variant. They usually have a black spotted body, with a black streak going through the body and a red bottom. They also have short fins with feelers coming from the bottom of their stomach.;
, Pearl gouramis are tropical fish. A decent temperature range for it would be from 71*F-80*F.

, Selecting tank mates shouldn't be so hard for the pearl gourami. When keeping tank mates with pearl gouramis at least 15 Gallons (57.78 Liters) is the minimum.


Fish that can be kept with Pearl gouramis are: tetra, Angelfish, Dwarf cichlids, Cory catfish, Barbs, ETC.






Fish that aren't likely to be successful are: Betta fish, Other Gouramis, or any other large fish likely to eat it.







, Keeping a very well planted aquarium can be beneficial for most fish including the Pearl Gourami. More dense plants or taller plants like Anubias plants, or Java ferns are great to keep in the aquarium. Floating plants would be another great option as well.

, Giving fish the proper nutrition usually promotes growth, and coloration. For Pearl gouramis tropical fish flakes, bloodworms, brine shrimp, and freeze dried shrimp.

, Acclimating is one of the more important things for fish survival. Acclimating fish is for your fish to adjust and adapt to the water parameters. it takes at least 15-30 minutes for the pearl gourami adjust to the temperature of the aquarium as well as aquarium parameters. Then, once acclimating is done, gently remove the gourami from the bag with a net. Do not let the water from the bag drip into the aquarium.

While many of the gourami species and varieties popular among aquarium hobbyists can be bred in the same conditions, this does not apply to every species. Ask an experienced fish breeder or biologist to examine your gouramis if you do not remember the name they were sold under.


This guide is accurate for dwarf gouramis, pearl gouramis, kissing gouramis, blue (three spot) gouramis, and honey gouramis. Note that kissing gouramis may be more difficult to breed than the others, and require a larger tank.
True gouramis and chocolate gouramis are especially difficult to care for and breed, and the process is not covered in this article. The chocolate gourami, and some other species, care for the eggs in a parent's mouth.If your gouramis do not belong to the species listed above, or if you are not certain of the species, you may still use this guide, but you may have a lower success rate or encounter unexpected difficulties.;
, Animal food such as blood worms, mosquito larvae, and adult brine shrimp provide adult fish with the nutrients necessary for breeding. You can purchase this in live or frozen form from an aquarium store. Supplement the dry food diet with this food several times a week.


Gathering this type of food on your own increases the risk of passing on diseases to your fish, and is not recommended without the advice of a local expert.

, Adult, female gouramis may swell or change color on their underside, as they produce eggs within their bodies. Male gouramis may become more brightly colored if their diet improves, an indicator of good health and suitability for breeding. Try to find one male and one female that display these characteristics, and have no visible defects.


It may be easier to notice the change in size looking down from above.

, If the females have noticeably changed shape as they laid eggs, or became ""gravid,"" you may already know which gouramis are female and which are male. Some are relatively easy to identify at any point due to coloration differences. If these methods of identification are not sufficient, try the following methods:


In some gourami species, females have a more rounded dorsal and anal fin (along the spine and near the anus), while the males have a more pointed one.
Kissing gourami are difficult to identify by appearance. However, if two of the gourami are ""kissing,"" they likely belong to the same sex, and are fighting for dominance.
If all your fish seem ""swollen,"" try withholding their food for three or four days. Overweight males may slim down during this time, while egg bearing females probably will not., For most gourami pairs, select a tank that can hold 10–20 gallons (40–80 liters) of water up to a six inches (15 cm) water level.This relatively small size and shallow water level actually encourages breeding and fry health, but it is not suitable for all species. Here are a few notable exceptions:


Kissing gourami will only spawn in a large tank, at least 24 inches (60 cm) deep and at least 36 inches (91 cm) long.Pearl gourami can be bred in a tank with this water depth, but the tank should be at least 31 inches (80 cm) long.Blue, or three-spot, gourami can be bred in this tank size, but a somewhat larger tank will work as well.A larger tank may minimize stress and injury to the female.
Species that grow more than 10 inches (25 cm) long, including the true gourami and giant gourami, may require much larger tanks. Consult an expert before attempting to breed these species, with the exception of the kissing gourami described above.

, Start by adding a thin layer of gravel at the bottom. Use this to anchor several plants, large enough for the female to hide behind if the male becomes aggressive.Leave some open area as well.


Upturned clay pots and other common aquarium additions can also be added to create hiding spots.
If putting rocks in the tank, be sure these are bought from an aquarium store, as rocks gathered in lakes and rivers may alter the pH of the water.

, Some species, such as the pearl gourami, create a ""bubble nest"" for the eggs on the underside of a floating plant. You may use actual floating plants, or cut a Styrofoam cup in half lengthwise and float it on the surface of the water.For species that do not build bubble nests, such as kissing gourami, you may wish to float a piece of lettuce instead, which will provide nutrients for the newly hatched fry.


Do not cover more than 1/3 of the water surface, as gouramis need to take oxygen directly from the air as well as the water.

, Protect the air above the water level from cold drafts by attaching a lid to the aquarium. Make sure there is air between the lid and the water level, and that the lid contains holes to allow the passage of some air.


While this is not necessary for adult gourami, young fry are highly susceptible to air temperature changes, and could die if the air becomes too cold.

, Never use a filter or air stone that creates a current in a breeding tank, as the current can destroy eggs and young fry. Adults may not be willing to lay eggs unless the water is completely still.

, Use an aquarium test kit to monitor these attributes of the tank water for several days, before any fish are introduced. Prepare the tank with a ""fishless cycle"" to keep toxic nitrites and nitrates out of the water.Heat the tank to around 77–82ºF (25–28ºC), and adjust the pH to between 6.6 and 7.5. Lower pH by adding soft water, such as reverse osmosis water, and raise it by adding crushed limestone, coral, or other carbonate materials.



Warning: Do not transfer fish between tanks with different temperatures. Instead, gradually increase the temperature of the tank after the breeding fish have been introduced.
The temperature and pH ranges given here are a narrow band suitable for all the common gourami species mentioned at the beginning of this guide. If you have identified your gourami species, you may be able to search online for a broader range of acceptable conditions for that species.

, Move the female gourami you have selected to breed into the breeding tank first. This gives the female fish time to locate hiding spots and acclimatize to the tank.

, After at least an hour, or up to a full day, introduce the male to the tank. Watch the behavior of the two fish, making sure the female has enough hiding places to remain alone for part of the day.


The male may cause minor bruising or scrapes on the female while chasing her. If the female sustains more serious injuries, or is being harassed around the clock, consider adding a second female to divide the male's attention.

, It may be several days before the gourami pair mates. While the exact nature of the mating ritual, amplexus, and/or spawning varies by species, it typically takes several hours. Look for the following signs if you are trying to catch the fish in the act:In many gourami species, the male will create a nest of bubbles before mating occurs. This nest may be in a corner of a tank, or on the underside of a floating object.
The two fish may ""dance"" around each other, eventually touching and wriggling against each other. In some species, they will latch together and one will roll onto its back.
As the female lays eggs (usually hundreds or thousands), the male may pick these up in his mouth and move them to the bubble nest. In species that do not construct bubble nests, the eggs are typically strewn around into the water.

, The adult female gourami should be moved back to the original tank directly after spawning, or she may eat the eggs. If the male constructed a ""bubble nest,"" he will likely continue to care for the young until the fry become free-swimming, after which he should be removed as well. For species that do not construct a nest, such as kissing gourami, remove the parents immediately after spawning.


The male may not eat much or at all while he is caring for the eggs. Pay attention to his eating habits and reduce the amount of food if necessary to avoid making the water dirty.

, Fry typically hatch within 30 hours of spawning, often within the first 24 hours for some species.If they were laid in bubble nests, the fry usually stay attached to their place of hatching for two or three days, as they consume the yolk of their egg sac.After eating the yolk from their own eggs, the fry will become free swimming, moving around the tank, and will need to be fed according to the instructions below.

, The newly hatched fry are too small to eat most types of food. Suitable foods, which may be available at an aquarium store, include liquid fish food, rotifers, infusoria, or hard boiled egg yolk pushed through cheesecloth. Try to feed them as often as you can manage, six times a day or more.


Infusoria can be grown at home by keeping a small piece of lettuce or potato in a jar of water in a sunny area. After a few days, the water should turn cloudy, then clear, and can then be fed to the fry in small amounts., Dwarf gourami, honey gourami, and other species whose adults are less than 5 inches (13 cm) in length produce fry that are too small to eat larger food for seven or eight days after hatching. Larger species may be able to eat baby brine shrimp after about four days.Once the fry have reached this stage, feed them baby brine shrimp to give them the protein needed for growth.

, Continue to conduct partial water changes as you would in a normal tank, and siphon off material collecting on the bottom of the tank. Because the fry are easily sucked into the siphon, give the bucket of removed water some time to settle so you can find and transfer any fry back into the tank.

, Gourami typically produce hundreds or thousands of eggs, and while it's unlikely that all of them will survive, you will often end up with more fry than can fit in your tank. Find someone who will buy your fry, decide how many you will keep, and consider euthanizing fish with obvious physical defects.

, Remaining fry can be fed on an ordinary diet once they have reached several weeks of age, although a diet that includes a variety of animal and vegetable proteins is better for growth than fish flakes alone.

Which since they are 2 inches (5.1 cm) in size they would make a great center piece for a smaller community aquarium maybe the size of 20 gallons (75 Liters). Like most tropical fish, they appear vibrant. Female dwarf gouramies have faded color and aren't usually as common as males are. Males always come in a very bright variation and will come in:


Blue Powder
Red Flame
Green;
, Although the dwarf gourami is one of the smallest of it's family it should still be in an appropriate aquarium size. 15 gallons (54 Liters) is would be considered an appropriate tank size for a single gourami and a few other tank mates. Only one gourami per aquarium or a pair but, should come from the SAME aquarium and the SAME store! Gouramis are like betta fish; they will attack fish that resemble the physical appearance of a betta fish.

, All gouramies are tropical and should be housed in an aquarium with appropriate temperatures. An appropriate Temp would be ranging from 75F*-80F* (23*C).

, Dwarf gouramies aren't considered aggressive but, will show aggression to other anatibids like: Betta fish, other gouramies, etc. Otherwise they are capable of living in an aquarium with community fish.


Can be housed with: Cory Catfish, Tetra, Angelfish, smaller Loaches, and other smaller fish or fish unlikely to bother it.
Fish unlikely to do well with dwarf gourami: Betta fish, Other Gouramis, and other Anatibids or fish with long fins and vibrant colors.

, Dwarf gouramies usually are quite shy fish. It would be best to keep a few Artificial/Live plants in the aquarium for it to hide. Driftwood can be used in the aquarium as well.

, An appropriate diet for the dwarf gourami would be tropical flakes or bloodworms. Other foods like frozen plankton do provide gouramies with appropriate nutrition. Some tropical foods contain color enhancers so the fish look more vibrant.

, For other fish as well, a dwarf gourami should acclimate 15-30 minutes to adjust to parameters of the water including temperature. Also be sure to gently take the gourami out of the bag (using a net) and be careful of not getting any water from the bag inside of the aquarium.

, In addition, the female needs place where she can hide. The reason for this step is the same as the reason for having a large tank. The male may be too intrusive and threatening while breeding.You can use items like driftwood and decorations to create hiding places. You can also use rocks for this purpose. Make sure you buy items that are meant for the aquarium., Once your female has had her babies, she will need to be removed.Similarly, once the babies hatch, you'll need to take the male out. That means you need a tank each for the male, female, and the babies.The other two tanks that are not for breeding can be 20 gallons each. You can house other fish in these aquariums. Fish that are approximately the same size work best.To scoop up a fish, you can remove some of the plant life and lower the water in the tank to make it easier to catch the fish.To acclimate the fish to the new tank, you can treat it like bringing a new fish home. That is, place it in a smaller container or plastic bag with some of the old tank water. Add a cup of the new water and let it sit for 10 minutes before adding just the fish to the new tank., Gouramis respond to a change in the depth of the water. When it becomes less deep, they are more likely to breed than when it is deeper. Remove some of the water from the tank to make the depth shallower to encourage breeding.The tank can be as low as 6 inches for breeding., Male gouramis build a bubble nest for their young. To do so, they need plant leaves at the surface. Therefore, you need to add plants to the aquarium to allow them to breed.Ricca is a common floating plant used with gouramis. However, you can also use fake floating plants designed for aquariums., For breeding, the gouramis prefer the water to be a bit warmer than usual. You'll need to increase the temperature to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.You can actually keep the tank at this temperature normally, but you can also keep it as low as 72 degrees Fahrenheit., Before you introduce the pair, you should be offering them live food or frozen food. You can offer this food a couple of times a day in small portions.The extra protein in this diet will help prepare the pair for breeding.Blood worms are a good option for blue gouramis., Place a male gourami and a female gourami in the breeding tank you've prepared. You don't need to do anything special to introduce the pair except placing them in the same tank.You should only have one breeding pair in the tank at a time.

, The male will build a bubble nest. It may be in a corneror under a floating plant leaf.Usually, the nest will be at the surface. The male creates bubbles with his saliva that form a nest. He will often join it with the side of the tank or a leaf to help it hold together., Watch the nest to see when the female lays her eggs in it. Once she does, you will need to take her to another tank.A female gourami can lay a large amount of eggs, up to 800.The male of the species actually becomes the protector of the eggs. In fact, he becomes so protective that he will attack the female if she approaches. Therefore, she needs to be taken away so she isn't harmed and the male can be at peace. In fact, you may not be able to see the eggs due to the bubbles, but you should be able to notice the male staying close to the nest., When the fry start swimming, you should remove the male to another tank (not the same one as the female). You need to remove him because he could start eating the fry once they start swimming.The fry will hatch in a day, but they won't start swimming for four days. You need to remove the male before they start swimming., You have two main options for feeding the babies. You can either feed them infusoria, which are microworms you find at the local pet store, or liquid fry food, which you can also probably find at your pet store.Once they get large enough, they can eat baby shrimp. Your fish should be able to eat these in about a week."

Measure your tank.,
Maintain proper water levels.,
Use the gallon/liter rule.,
Use the surface area rule.,
Decide what sort of fish you want to keep.,
Consider stocking levels.,
Research the specific needs of your fish.,
Know the oxygen needs of your fish.,
Figure out filtration.,
Maintain a consistent feeding schedule.,
Clean your tank regularly.",How to Know How Many Fish You Can Place in a Fish Tank," The standard measurement is liters. You should be able to figure out how big your tank is when you initially purchase it. But if you don’t know (or don’t remember) the size, you can figure it out on your own mathematically.To find out how many liters your tank is measure the length, width, and height of the tank in centimeters and multiply them together, then divide by 1000. This number is only approximate as the actual value will be rather less due to glass thickness, substrate, decorations, etc.;
, Have the water at the right level to accurately calculate how many fish will fit. If your water levels get too low, your tank won’t be able to sustain as many fish. Typically, you should keep the water level about one inch above the lip of the tank’s water filter.Remember that water displacement also plays a factor here. If you have a lot of decorations in your tank, you won’t be able to house as many fish as a tank the same size with fewer decorations would.

, A good general rule for determining how many fish your tank can safely hold is the fish per gallon guideline. Typically, a properly maintained tank can handle one inch of fish per gallon of water.For metric measurements, you can reckon one gram of fish for every four liters of water.
This guideline works best for small community fish like tetras, rainbowfish, platies, etc.

, Since the surface of the water is where gaseous exchanges happen that help sustain your fish, it is important to consider this factor when stocking your tank. A larger surface area means more oxygen exchange for the fish in the tank.A taller tank with the same surface area as a shorter tank isn’t able to house more fish even though it technically holds more water.
Typically this is a better rule of thumb to use when deciding how many fish to keep in your tank because it accounts for the oxygen needs of the fish, rather than just the available space in the aquarium.

, Do you want a community with lots of small fish? A semi-aggressive community with fewer, larger fish? Or maybe just one large fish? Look around, see what you like, then do as much research as you can on compatibility and maximum size.Some fish are more aggressive than others and need more space for themselves, while others do well in larger communities of fish. Do your research before you start integrating your fish.

, For small community fish (under three inches each), one inch of adult fish per gallon of water is a good guideline. For larger fish however, it can be tricky to decide how many fish. Assuming your list contains no fish too big for your tank or unsuitable to keep with other fish you want, start with one inch for every 7.5 liters of water and see how the tank looks.Don’t forget your fish will grow.
You want a balance between amount of fish on the top, middle, and bottom. This means considering where the types of fish you choose generally swim. For example, Plecostomus are typically bottom dwellers, while beta tend to stay at the top., Always look into the individual characteristics of any fish you would like to put in your tank together. Many require different things to be satisfied in their tank.


Some fish are messy, some very aggressive, some nocturnal. Look at information from many sources to figure out these differences.

, Different kinds of fish have different oxygen requirements. Full-bodied fish like goldfish use more oxygen than slender-bodied fish like tetras. If you are stocking your tank with mostly larger fish, they will require more oxygen (and therefore, more space in the tank) than if you were filling the tank mainly with smaller fish.Stocking measurements should consider the adult size/weight of the fish in the tank to fully account for the necessary oxygen needs of the fish as they grow. So if you purchase your fish as juveniles, make sure you think about how big they will grow to become (and what oxygen levels the adult sized fish will require) when considering how many fish to keep in your tank.

, You need more filtration for messy fish or large numbers of fish, but the largest filter you can get will always be helpful. Filtration systems help maintain the cleanliness of the tank and the purity of the water so your fish can thrive in their tank.Find a filter recommended for your tank size and get the one a size or two up, especially if you are pushing the limits with the number of fish you’re housing in your tank.

, Overfeeding your fish will lead to a messier, harder to maintain tank. This will eventually decrease the number of fish that can be safely sustained in your tank.Typically, you should feed your fish only what they can eat in 4-5 minutes. So, observe your fish during feeding time and experiment with different amounts of food. A good rule of thumb for smaller fish is three flakes of food per fish per day.
Overfeeding can also lead to high ammonia and nitrate levels, low oxygen levels, low pH levels, fin rot, improper digestion, mold, and cloudy water.

, A dirty tank can cause a lot of problems for your fish. It can make your fish sick, uncomfortable, or even die. The dirtier your tank is, the less fish it can support because of compromised oxygen and filtration issues. You should generally clean your fish tank once a month, even if you have a good filtration system.Make sure you safely remove all fish before you start cleaning the tank.

Quarantine the betta.Before you add the betta to a community, it needs to be quarantined.,
Ensure your tank is clean.,
Check environmental conditions.The tank’s conditions should be within the parameters a betta fish can tolerate.,
Acclimate your betta to the community.After the quarantine period is over, your betta is ready to join the other fish.,
Fold the top edges of the bag down.The edges of the bag should be rolled down so that they are slightly submerged in the water.,
Add water to the bag.Every four minutes, add about half a cup of tank water to the bag.,
Monitor your fish.Keep a close eye on your betta for the first few days after adding it to the community tank.",How to Add a Betta to a Community Tank1," This will give you time to monitor the betta’s condition to ensure it does not develop illnesses that it could then spread to the rest of the fish in the community tank. During the two-week quarantine period, ensure that your fish eats properly, demonstrates normal activity, and remains free of signs of parasites.


If your fish does show signs of illness during the quarantine period, take it to a vet.
Common symptoms of illness in betta fish include a bloated body or a refusal to eat (constipation), fluffy white growths on its body (fungus), torn or disintegrating fins (fin rot), small white spots on the body or fins (ich), or a grayish slime covering the body or fins (slime disease). Any other behavioral abnormalities or symptoms of illness should be taken seriously and referred to a veterinarian.Obtain betta fish from qualified betta breeders. A breeder is more likely to give you a healthy fish than a pet store.;
, Use visual checks to ensure your tank is free of algae and debris floating on top of the water or settled on the bottom. Ensure your tank’s filter is clean and operating properly. Add a UV sterilizer to reduce the risk of disease.If necessary, change your tank’s water.


Clean the tank’s gravel by scooping it out and placing it in a sieve, then rinsing it with hot water for a few minutes. Replace it after cleaning.

, Check the thermometer to ensure the temperature is between 75 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit (about 26 degrees Celsius). Use your pH meter to make sure the acidity is between 6.5 and 7.5.


If your tank is too cold, invest in a heat lamp, in-tank heater, or under-tank heater. These are readily available at most pet stores.
Get a small pH test kit from your local pet store or online to check the pH level.
If you want to lower the pH level in the tank, you’ll need to add an acidic compound specially designed for fish. Indian almond leaf (IAL) and blackwater extract (BWE) are common additives. You could also add peat to your filter and add some untreated wood to your tank.If you want to increase the pH, add a crushed coral or limestone chip substrate.
Check your local pet store for materials and compounds to adjust pH levels. Always follow specific use directions when adjusting pH levels. Dramatic changes could negatively impact your fish.

, Turn off the aquarium lights and dim the aquarium room’s overhead lights. Transfer the betta to a small plastic bag. Float the bag (with the betta fish still in it) in the water of the community tank for about 15 minutes. Move it slowly and gently through the water.


This helps the water temperature in the bag approach the water temperature in the tank.

, The air trapped between the rolled-down edges and the bag should allow the bag (and the betta fish within) to continue floating without your help.

, When the bag is full, dump out half the water from the bag, then float it in the tank again. Begin filling the bag with tank water again, adding half a cup every four minutes. When you fill it to the top for a second time, net the betta fish and place it in the tank.


Dump out the water you placed in the bag.

, Look for signs that the community arrangement is not working out, such as conflicts between the betta and other fish, or finding your betta fish floating alone in a corner of the tank.


Have a backup plan before adding the betta to the community tank. If the betta is not accepted by the community, the best backup plan you can enact is to simply transfer the betta back to an individual tank of at least five gallons.
Major warning signs include missing scales, visible bits missing from the betta’s fins (due to being bitten), disappearance of community fish (due to the betta eating them), or the presence of stress stripes (darkly colored horizontal stripes along the betta’s body).
Do not confuse stress stripes with a female’s breeding stripes, which are vertical.

, It's always good to have knowledge of the variety of fish types that you can purchase. Also make sure you know the pH level of your tank as fish species vary in preference. The aquarist or worker at the pet shop or aquarium hobby store should be aware of the pH needs of the different species of fish at the store., Take a look at their fish species. They will have tags saying whether the fish are community fish, proceed with caution/community fish with other fast swimmers, or non community fish. For most aquarium owners, community fish are your best option. You will want a mix of top feeders, mid-dwelling fish, and bottom feeders.


Some aquarium hobby stores will keep the tanks stocked with common, popular fish but will change up the species of the ""specialty"" fish. Depending on the type, you may not be able to get it readily in the future.

, Top feeders can be identified by their mouth near the top of their head. Top feeders consist of guppies, mollies, platies, swordtails, hatchetfish, and gourami. Out of these, guppies, mollies, and platies are easiest to take care of.

, There are many varieties of fish to consider in this category. Barbs, danios, tetras, and Harlequin rasboras are just a few breeds. They are all very easy to take care of, but tetras do not tend to live as long as the others. These fish are all schooling fish, and should purchase a minimum of three.

, Cory catfish will clean the bottom of the aquarium and help to keep it clean. Plecos and loaches will eat the algae growing on the tank's walls. For small tanks, Panda cories are recommended. Julii corydoras also make great fish mates.


Algae wafers should also be provided for plecos and some catfish. Supplying wafers ensures that the fish are getting the proper amount of nutrients.

, You do not want to purchase too many fish, but at the same time you want a nice variety. For 10 gallon (37.9 L) tanks, you may just want three top swimmers, three mid-dwellers, and three small catfish. For larger tanks (20 gallons and up), you can start with more fish in the tank. Remember the rule: 1 inch (2.5 cm) fish for every gallon.

, The worker may suggest that you get certain fish over other's if you are a beginner.

Choose the sex of your fish.While you can add a female betta to a community with other female betta fish, it is not recommended that you keep male betta fish in the same tank as other males.,
Add a curious fish.A community tank offers more opportunity for exploration and enrichment than a solitary tank.,
Do not add aggressive fish to a community tank.While male betta fish, especially, tend to be very aggressive, all betta fish are solitary by nature and can be aggressive if they perceive that another fish is in their zone.",How to Add a Betta to a Community Tank2," Males can be extremely aggressive and territorial, especially when they see other betta fish.


Females are generally less aggressive and territorial than females, but you should keep an eye on any betta fish in your tank -- male or female -- for problematic behavior.
Do not attempt to mix male and female betta fish unless you’re trying to breed them. If this is the case, monitor their interactions carefully and separate them at the first sign of conflict.

, Even though betta fish prefer having their own space, they are quite intelligent. A community tank with non-threatening fish, snails, and other creatures will keep the betta engaged and active.


If you have not already decked your community tank out with fake plants, little fish houses, tubes, rocks, and hidey holes, consider adding some. Betta fish (and other species) enjoy exploring these spaces.

, Often, the only way to know if your betta would fit into a community tank is to try it. However, if you’ve had your betta in contact with another community before, use that experience as a guide when thinking about whether or not the fish would like to live in another community.

"
"
Determine compatible species.Certain fish are more appropriate as betta tankmates than others.,
Select the right sized tank.The minimum tank size for any community tank is 15 gallons (56.8 L).,
Do not add betta fish to a tank with fin nippers.Betta fish have long, flowing fins.,
Do not add a betta fish to a tank with colorful fish.Betta fish will perceive most guppies, goldfish, tropical fish, and other bright and multicolored fish as enemies or rivals.Only in rare instances (such as when a betta is housed with another especially shy betta) can it live in peace with colorful fish or guppies.

,
Add fish that share the same environmental conditions as the betta.Betta fish prefer water with a pH of between 6.5 and 7.5.",How to Add a Betta to a Community Tank3," Cories, for instance, are bottom feeders and share space easily with betta (who prefer swimming along the top of the tank). Loaches and otocinclus catfish, likewise, are also bottom feeders and therefore compatible with betta fish. Other species that you could select for a betta community include:


Ghost shrimp -- these shrimp are entirely transparent, making it difficult for betta fish to see them. Other sorts of shrimp such as Red Cherry shrimp may be eaten by the betta fish.
Snails -- any sort are good for a betta community, since they do their own thing along the bottom of the tank.
Feeder guppies -- these guppies are dull in color and thus unlikely to attract the betta’s attention.
Most corydoras, kuhli loaches, rasboras, white cloud mountain minnows, tetras, and bristlenose plecos also make good tankmates., Bettas generally like to move around their tank to explore.It is therefore important to provide a tank of the appropriate size.


Bettas should get at least 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) for themselves.Think about the spatial needs of the other fish and creatures in the community before introducing a betta. Ensure the community tank is not overcrowded.

, While very beautiful, certain fish will think the betta’s fins are there for them to nibble. Tiger barbs, for instance, should not be in the same tank as a a betta.


This is not a mere annoyance for the betta fish. Nipped fins can become infected and lead to increased stress.,, The temperature of a tank with betta fish in it should simulate the temperature of the tropics, around 75 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (about 26 degrees Celsius).Finally, the community tank you’re adding the betta to should have a gentle filter, since betta fish are from non-flowing waters.You can test your water’s pH levels with a pH monitor. A simple handheld monitor should be available at your local pet store.
Aquarium tank thermometers are useful for monitoring the temperature in your betta fish tank. Keep one in the tank so you can check the temperature quickly at all times.
Do not keep your betta in a tank without a filter unless you have the time and energy necessary to perform frequent, high-volume water changes.
Do not use distilled water. Betta fish need water with vitamins and minerals that are unavailable in distilled water."

Determine the size of your aquarium.,
A good idea for the next step is getting some books from the library or searching for ""freshwater fish species"" on Google.,
You need to find out how aggressive the fish you like is.,
If you buy a female and male fish that might breed, find out if they will be aggressive to other fish.,
Find out what food this fish likes to eat, it may be hard to find and you might find yourself with a starved fish.,
Find out how hard or easy the fish is to keep.,
Next, learn where to find the fish.,
If you are planning a community tank, make sure the species you plan on putting together are compatible and have similar requirements.,
If you still have trouble finding out what fish you want to put together, you may want to join an online fish forum for advice.",How to Choose Fish for a Freshwater Aquarium," This will help you choose what kind of fish can fit in your tank and narrow down the choice of fish. Some fish need a lot of space or live in a school that won't fit in your aquarium. Some Freshwater aquarium fish can be over a foot long! The fish's adult size is what you should be thinking of, not their current size. (Think clown loaches!) Your aquarium may not have enough space for some fish that are territorial to get away from each other. Fish such as goldfish are messy and produce a lot of waste. These fish need better filtration and larger space to keep a certain number of fish, compared to cleaner fish that can be kept in larger numbers in smaller aquariums.;
, When you have found what kind of fish you are interested in keeping, you can find which ones are suitable for your tank, or how to make your tank suitable for the fish.

, Aggressive fish will fight. A lot of fish are aggressive with their own kind, or males of their own kind. Some fish are social and need to be placed with ""buddies"".

, Also, have a plan for any fry (baby fish) they have. Research the fish's breeding habits before purchasing and learn to identify their sexual dimorphism (the visual difference between the genders)

, Some fish eat only live food, like a knife fish. Some fish may eat invertebrates that you want to keep or will devour your other fish.

, By This I mean find out how much time you can set aside for your fish and how much work you can do. No fish is truly difficult if you can do the correct things for it. An example of a ""hard"" fish is discus. They like clean water so a couple of water changes a week is ideal for them. They can also carry disease more commonly than other fish. Determine how much time and work you can devote and purchase the fish accordingly.

, If the fish is very hard to find, consider getting a more common fish. Some fish are also expensive and may be too much money so consider a cheaper fish. Still, always look for quality!

, For example, don't put goldfish, which are cold water fish, in a tank with tropical fish like bettas (these fish are often grouped together as ""easy"" fish but are very different!).

, People on these forums are helpful and knowledgeable!

Give your tank a good wash, without soap or other harmful chemicals, before filling it with water.,
Set up your new tank with gravel/sand, ornaments, lights, (heater for tropical) and a filter.

,

,,


Fill the tank with cold water. Make sure you don't add any soap or other harmful chemicals to the water. Add nothing except water conditioner, which will make the water safe for fish.







,,, This is where all of the beneficial bacteria lives. This bacteria is not free-floating, so just getting some of their water won't do much good. Warn them at least two weeks in advance so they can put extra media in their filter. Otherwise, they might hurt their own colony of bacteria by giving you some of theirs.


Bring the media home in a bucket with water from their tank in it. Get it home as soon as you can or the bacteria will start to die off without a source of ammonia.
It needs to be kept out of sunlight - UV will kill the precious bacteria.

,


Add a source of ammonia besides fish, such as fish food or household ammonia. This will keep the bacteria alive until you can get your fish.

, If the bacteria can process the ammonia you give them in 24 hours (i.e., you have 0 ammonia, 0 nitrite, and some nitrate) your tank is now fully cycled and you are ready for your fish.


Get a pH test for the tank if you don't have one. This way, you can test for ammonia, nitrites and nitrates in your tank water. Make sure ammonia and nitrites are always 0, and that the nitrates are below 40ppm. If ammonia or nitrite levels go too high, the fish will be get ammonia burns and most likely die.







,


Feed the fish as much as they can eat in 2 to 4 minutes.For tanks with a smaller amount of fish or smaller fish, feed them once a day, as much as they can eat in 1 to 2 minutes.Healthy fish always act hungry, so overfeeding is hard to avoid.







, If nitrate goes over 40ppm, perform a large water change.


If you see an ammonia or nitrite spike in any quantity do 50% water changes until it clears up.

, Too much algae isn't healthy for your fish.

, Take them out and rinse them under cold water without soap or other stuff. Then place them back in your tank. If it's on the glass, scrub it off using a cloth that hasn't been used.

Consider the breed.,
Factor in the fish's gender.,
Evaluate other competitive factors.,
Decide how many fish to get.,
Add lots of hiding places to your tank.,
Distract the existing aggressive fish.,
Introduce new fish simultaneously.,
Give your fish more food and multiple sources of food.,
Let them fight it out.,
Change the environment.,
Separate highly aggressive fish.",How to Buy Fish for an Aggressive Freshwater Aquarium," Though you may not realize it, some fish breeds are more prone to being aggressive or semi-aggressive than others. These breeds of fish may require more space through a larger tank, or they may simply need to be kept in isolation.It's important to choose carefully when you select a breed.While there may be exceptions, the following fish are generally considered aggressive or semi-aggressive:


goliath tigerfish
vampire tetra
peacock bass
snakehead fish
piranhas
Arowana
tiger barbs
betta fish
most types of cichlid;
, While some breeds are simply more prone to aggression than others, the gender of any given breed may also be a consideration. For example, paradise fish are generally peaceful creatures, but the males are known to display acts of aggression towards other fish (including other paradise fish).Ask a fish expert (either a pet store employee or a local wildlife biologist) whether your chosen fish breed(s) would cohabitate better if they were all male, all female, or a mix.

, Depending on the types of fish you're combining, an otherwise non-aggressive fish may become aggressive over time. Two of the biggest factors are space and resources, though of course you'll have to consider the behavior of each individual species as well.How big will each fish get? Will they have enough room, or will they begin to compete for space and resources?
Are any of the types of fish you're considering combining known to eat other fish? If so, this will almost certainly create a hostile situation no matter what precautions you take.

, Once you've decided to combine fish into the same aquarium, you'll also have to consider how many fish you want to add. You might logically think that fewer fish will mean a reduced risk of aggression, but that isn't always necessarily the case.Some nonterritorial fish breeds, like tiger barbs, are known to become aggressive when kept in too small a school.
In the case of tiger barbs, adding more fish of this breed actually reduces the risk of them becoming aggressive with one another.
Talk to a fish expert before deciding on how many fish to add.

, The best way to reduce the risk of aggression is by reducing the risk of confrontation. Most fish fight over territory, so by providing a lot of micro-territories you can ensure that each fish has its own distinguished space.Hiding places serve two purposes: they offer your fish a sanctuary to hide in, and they can serve as their own micro-territories for each fish to lay its own claim to.
Choose fish accessories with hollowed-out sections, as these make great hiding places.
Check your local pet store for any accessories that have tunnels or other hollow spaces.
You can also add rocks with hollow ""caves,"" if your tank has sufficient room.

, When the time comes for you to add the new fish to your existing tank, you'll want to distract the existing aggressive fish as much as possible. The easiest way to do this is by using the so-called ""mirror trick.""Stand a mirror outside the tank where the aggressive fish can see it. It should be close to the tank, so either stand it up near the glass or find a way to press it up against the tank.
The aggressive fish will be distracted by its reflection. In the meantime, your new fish can get acclimated and establish its own territory.
Leave the mirror there until the new fish has settled in.

, If you're going to introduce more than one new fish into an established aggressive tank, you may want to add them all at once. This allows each fish to establish its own territory simultaneously, which will cause less conflict than if several aggressive fish already had their own claimed territories.You should still distract any existing aggressive fish with a mirror prior to adding new fish, even if the new fish are added at the same time.
Make sure there are a sufficient number of hiding places for each fish before you add them to the existing tank.

, Aggressive fish don't just fight for social order; many also fight over resources like food. When you introduce new fish into an aggressive aquarium, you'll want to ensure that you give the fish more food than usual. You may also want to consider providing more than one source of food.Consider feeding your fish simultaneously from both ends of the tank to allow feeding across the aquarium.

, Though it may sound counterintuitive, sometimes it's best to let new fish fight it out (so long as none of the fish appear to be trying to kill the others). Fish establish an order of dominance that puts the most aggressive/dominant fish at the top of the hierarchy. Some fish will continue to fight, in which case further measures will be necessary. However, many fish will settle into their newly-adopted roles once they hash things out.
Keep an eye on your fish. If the most dominant one continues to bully and harass the others, you'll need to change up their environment to correct the problem.

, If your fish have been fighting it out and it seems like one is simply bullying the other(s), you may need to change up the aquarium's layout. Changing or rearranging the environment can help ""reset"" each fish's established territories.Try rearranging the accessories inside your tank. Take out one or two old ones and add as many new ones as you can, or simply change the location of existing accessories in the tank.
If rearranging the tank doesn't work, you may need to try moving all of your fish into a new, larger tank and providing them with brand new accessories/hiding places.

, If changing the environment hasn't worked and your fish won't stop fighting no matter what you do, you may need to bite the bullet and separate them into two or more different tanks. If one or more highly aggressive fish relentlessly attack another fish, that fish could eventually suffer from infections or further injuries, resulting in death.Most aquarium enthusiasts choose to remove the fish that is getting attacked the most. However, you may choose to remove the aggressive fish instead.
If there are other fish in the tank, be aware that they may try to establish a new order of dominance once a fish (either the aggressive one or the victim) is removed.
Another option is to purchase a net breeder from your local pet store. This device hangs inside the tank and allows you to isolate the aggressive fish within its own tank while the other fish establish their own territories.
If using a net breeder, keep the most aggressive fish isolated for about one week. This should be enough time for the order of dominance to adjust or reset accordingly.
Continue to monitor the fish to ensure that they find some type of stable order and eventually cohabitate.

Wash the gravel, rocks, and ornaments.,
Fill the tank one-third full with room temperature water.,
Connect the air pump.,
Add live or plastic plants.,
Cycle the water in the tank with a cycling kit.,
Test the water quality.",How to Add Fish to New Tank1," Once you get your new tank and your tank additions, you will need to wash them in warm water. Do not use any soap or detergents to wash the gravel, rocks, or ornaments, just warm water. This will ensure these items are free of dirt, bacteria, and toxins.You can wash the gravel by placing it in a colander. Put the colander over a plastic pan or bucket and add water to the colander with the gravel. Stir the gravel around, drain it, and repeat this several times until the water runs clear and clean through the colander.
Once these items are clean, you can add them to the tank. Make sure the gravel is evenly distributed at the bottom of the tank. Place the rocks and ornaments in the tank so there are hiding places for your fish to explore.;
, Use a clean bucket to pour water into the tank. Place a plate or saucer over the gravel as you pour in the water so the gravel does not move around.Once you have filled the tank one-third with room temperature water, you should add water conditioner or dechlorinator to remove the chlorine from your fish. Chlorine in the tank water can be deadly for your fish, and/or lead to health issues.
You may notice that the water turns cloudy within the first two to three days. This is due to bacteria growth and should disappear naturally.

, You should have an air pump in your tank to ensure there is enough oxygen in the tank water. You will need to connect the airline tubing from the air pump to air outlets in your tank, such as an air stone.You may want to use an aquarium check valve, which is a small valve located outside your tank to hold the air tubing. This will allow you to then place the air pump underneath your tank or aquarium. The valve also acts as a stop and prevents water from backing up in your tank if somehow the power to the tank is switched off.

, Live plants are good for circulating oxygen in the tank water, but you can also add plastic plants to create hiding places for your fish. You can also use the plants to hide any equipment in the tank that you want to disguise for aesthetic purposes.Keep the live plants moist until they are going to be planted by wrapping them in wet newspaper. Plant the roots below the surface of the gravel, with the crown of the plant exposed. You can also apply an aquatic plant fertilizer to make sure your live plants grow well.

, Cycling the tank water will help to balance out the ammonia and nitrites produced by the fish and introduce bacteria that will eat these harmful chemicals. You will need to cycle the tank water for four to six weeks so the tank can maintain a healthy biological and chemical balance. Doing this before adding the fish can help to ensure your new fish stay happy and healthy in their new environment. You can find cycling kits for aquariums at your local pet store or online.When you first cycle the tank from scratch, you will notice a build up of ammonia around the second or third week. Then, there will be a build of nitrites when the ammonia levels drop to zero. At around week six of cycling, the ammonia and nitrites will drop to zero and you will notice a build up of nitrate. Nitrate is less toxic than ammonia and nitrite. You can control the level of nitrate with proper, regular maintenance of the tank water.
If you use the cycling kit and notice there is still a positive reading for ammonia or nitrites, your tank is still cycling and will need more time to cycle before you add the fish. A healthy tank should never show a positive reading for either chemical.

, Once the tank has been cycled properly, you should also test the water quality of the tank. You can use a water test kit from a pet store or online.


The tank water should have a zero reading for chlorine and the pH of the water should match or be as close as possible to the fish shop where your new fish is coming from.

Many fish are territorial and may exhibit possessive behavior if they are housed in a crowded tank. A veterinarian or expert will be able to help you decide what type of fish will be compatible with your fish tank and what type of fish will happily co-exist with the creatures already living in the tank.


Angelfish, for example, can be aggressive fish. They may exhibit territorial behavior toward particular types of fish, and they may even be aggressive toward their smaller tankmates.
Serpae tetras, another type of tropical fish, can also be a bit of a bully. They often nip at the long, flowy fins of other fish, such as Angelfish and betta fish. Serpae tetras typically get along with other, similar-sized tetras and bottom-feeder fish.;
, It is important to research the type of fish you would like to add to the tank, particularly how large the fish will grow. Be sure that your tank will provide enough room for the fish’s growth and that it will adequately house it once it reaches its full size., Use a testing kit to check the quality of the water. These kits can be found at your local pet store and include testing strips and a key to help interpret the water levels. The chlorine level in the tank should be at zero before you add new fish, and the pH balance should be equal to the pH balance of the water where you purchased your new fish.

, Tropical fish thrive in waters that are between 76° to 80°F, or 25° to 27°C, so using a tank heater and having a thermometer are crucial. Some species require that the temperature be adjusted slightly, so be sure to find out the proper temperature for your new fish.A submersible or a hang-on heater can help regulate the water temperature, which is particularly important during colder seasons. Be careful not to overheat the water in the warmer months.Use a stick-on tank thermometer to check the temperature regularly.

, When transporting the fish home, it is important to take a light cloth or towel with you so that the bag can be covered. This helps minimize the stress a fish can experience when being transported to a new location. Also, be sure to keep the journey home as short as possible.Getting the fish safely transported in a reasonable amount of time will help lessen the stress and trauma.

, Before adding your tropical fish in the main tank, you may wish to house the new fish in a separate tank for a couple of weeks to ensure that the fish is healthy and will not transfer any diseases, bacteria, parasites, or infectious diseases to the other creatures in your tank. This also offers a chance for a new tropical fish to recover from the stress of being transported before joining the other fish in your main tank.

, Be sure that the pH levels and temperature are similar to the levels in the main fish tank and use a similar filter and heater. This will allow your fish more time to adjust to the new atmosphere., Do not place anything on the floor of the quarantine tank if you are treating your new fish with any medications. Sand, rocks, and gravel can absorb copper salts and then release them later on, which can interfere with the medication., Adding a new fish to the tank can be stressful for both the new fish and those who have already made their home in the tank. To help make the introduction as stress-free as possible, lower the tank’s light or turn them off completely before introducing new fish. This will help create a less hostile, less stressful environment.

, Never buy several new tropical fish at once and add them to your tank. If you overload your tank, this can upset the pH balance, the ammonia levels, and the quality of life for the fish and other creatures., Let the unopened fish bag float in the tank water for about 30 minutes. This will help your new fish adjust to the temperature of the water in the tank. The water they have been housed in will be a different temperature from the water in your tank, so this process of acclimation is important., After the fish has acclimatized to the water temperature, keep the bag afloat in the tank. Slowly open the bag and pour about ¼ of a cup of tank water inside, taking care not to spill water into the tank. Every 15 minutes or so, add another quarter cup of the tank water into the bag. After an hour, your new fish should have adjusted to your tank’s water chemistry.The water from the quarantine tank should be kept separate from the main tank’s water supply in case there are any parasites or bacteria in the quarantine tank.

, The water from the quarantine tank may contain parasites or bacteria that may harm the other fish in your tank, and a freshwater dip will help remove anything that can harm the fish or contaminate the tank water.


Add dechlorinated freshwater to a container, making sure that the pH and temperatures are as close as possible to those of the main tank.
Using a net, gently lower the fish into the freshwater dip and allow it to swim in the container for 3-4 minutes, watching the fish’s behavior closely. Remove the fish from the freshwater if it floats or stops moving and place it back into a quarantine tank.

, Once your new tropical fish has had a freshwater dip, it will be ready to be placed in the main tank. Gently scoop up the fish with a net.

, With the fish in the net, swiftly but smoothly dip the net into the tank. Hold the net inside the water until the fish swims out of the net.

, As the new fish adjusts to its surroundings, be on the lookout for any signs of aggression, including chasing and nipping. Rearrange the plants and rocks in the tank to create new territorial boundaries if you see any signs of hostility or stress. If the aggression continues, place the aggressor in the quarantine tank for a half hour or so and return it to the main tank."
"
Transport the fish in a plastic bag from the store.,
Turn off the lights in the aquarium.,
Add more than one fish at a time.,
Place the unopened plastic bag in the tank for 15-20 minutes.,
Net the fish out of the bag and place him in the tank.",How to Add Fish to New Tank2," Most pet stores put fish in a clear plastic bag filled with water. Make sure you keep the fish in a dark place as you transport him home from the store.Try to get him home right away as he will need to be introduced to the tank soon after being placed in the plastic bag. This will reduce his levels of stress and help him acclimate faster to the tank water. Your fish may lose a little coloring during the trip home but don’t worry, this is normal and your fish should recover his coloring once he is in his tank.

, Dim or turn off any lights in the aquarium before you add your new fish, as this will create a less stressful environment for the fish. You should also make sure your tank has plenty of plants and rocks as hiding places for your new fish. These will help him feel less stressed out as he gets used to his new home.

, Adding more than one fish at a time will ensure your existing fish can get used to the new additions. It also prevents one fish from getting harassed by the other fish, as the existing fish will have multiple new friends to bond with. Introduce new fish in small batches of 2-4 so you do not overwhelm the tank.Always choose fish from the store that appear healthy and disease free. You should also carefully monitor your new arrival for the first several weeks to ensure there are no signs of disease or stress.
Some aquarium owners will place their new fish in quarantine for two weeks to ensure he does not have any diseases or infections. If you have the luxury of time and access to another clean tank you can use as your quarantine tank, you can try this option. If you notice the fish gets sick in the quarantine tank, you can treat him without affecting the other fish or the chemistry of the new tank.

, Let the unopened plastic bag with the fish float on the surface of the aquarium. This will give the fish time to get used to the temperature of the tank water.After 15-20 minutes, open the bag and use a clean cup to scoop an equal amount of water from the tank into the plastic bag. There should be twice as much water in the bag, 50% tank water and 50% pet store water. Make sure you do not mix the water from the bag into the tank water as this could contaminate the tank water.
Allow the bag to float in the tank for another 15-20 minutes. You can seal the edge of the bag to keep in from spilling out.

, After 15-20 minutes, release the fish into the tank. Do this by netting the fish in the bag and gently placing them into the water of the aquarium.You should monitor the fish for any signs of disease or illness. If there are already other fish in the tank, you should make sure they are not harassing or bothering the new addition. With time and proper maintenance of the tank, all the fish should co-exist happily.

Set up a quarantine tank.,
Place the new fish in the quarantine tank for two to three weeks.,
Do a 25 to 30 percent water change.,
Feed any fish in the main tank.,
Rearrange the accessories in the tank.,
Acclimatize the new fish to the main tank water.,
Introduce the new fish into the main tank.",How to Add Fish to New Tank3," Quarantining your new fish will ensure they are healthy and will not introduce disease or illness into your existing tank. The quarantine tank should be at least 5 to 10 gallons, with a sponge filter that has been in a tank with fish. This will ensure the filter contains good bacteria to populate the tank. The tank should also have a heater, an aquarium light, and a cover.If you are an avid aquarium owner, you may already have a quarantine tank set up. You should keep the quarantine tank clean and prepare it before you buy new fish for your regular tank.

, Once you get your quarantine tank set up, you can introduce your new fish to the tank through acclimatization.Start by placing the unopened plastic bag in the tank for 15-20 minutes. This will give the fish time to start getting used to the water in the quarantine tank.
After 15-20 minutes, open the bag and use a clean cup to scoop an equal amount of water from the tank into the plastic bag. There should be 50% tank water and 50% pet store water in the bag. Avoid mixing water from the bag with the tank water as this could contaminate the tank water.
Allow the bag to float in the tank for another 15-20 minutes. You can close the edge of the bag to keep in from spilling out. After 15-20 minutes, use a net to gently scoop out the fish and place them in the quarantine tank.
You should observe the fish every day in the quarantine tank to ensure they are not carrying any disease or parasites. After two to three weeks in the quarantine tank with no issues, the fish is ready to be introduced to the main tank.

, Doing a water change will allow your new fish to get used to the nitrates in the water and avoid stressing out your new fish. This is an especially important step if you do not do regular water changes of your main tank water.To do a 25 to 30 percent water change, remove 25 to 30 percent of the tank water and replace it with dechlorinated water. Then, cycle through the water several times with your filter to ensure the nitrate balance in the tank water is correct.

, If you already have fish in your tank and are introducing a new fish to the tank, you should make sure you feed the fish first. This will make the fish in the tank less aggressive towards the new addition.

, Move around any rocks, plants, and hiding places in the tank to new spots. Rearranging the accessories before you introduce the new fish will distract the existing fish and remove any established territories that have been marked in the tank. This will ensure your new fish enter the tank on equal grounds and are not isolated from the other fish., Once your new fish have been properly quarantined, you should repeat the same acclimatization process you did with the quarantine tank for the main tank water. This will help the fish get used to the main tank water and ease into their new environment.Place the fish in a bowl or bag filled with the quarantine tank water. Let the bag or bowl sit on the surface of the main tank water for 15-20 minutes. Then, use a clean cup to scoop some of the main tank water into the bag or bowl. There should be 50% main tank water and 50% quarantine tank water in the bag.

, Let your fish sit in the bag or bowl of water for another 15-20 minutes. Then, use a net to gently scoop the fish out of the bag or bowl and place him in the main tank.Monitor the new fish over the next few weeks to ensure he is getting along with his tank mates and is not displaying any signs of illness or disease.

Turn off aquarium light and dim the lights in the room where you're aquarium is set up.,
Float the bag in the water for 15 minutes.,
Cut open the bag.,
Add water to the bag every 4 minutes.,
Discard half the water and float the bag again.,
Add water from the tank every 4 minutes.,
Release the fish into the tank.",How to Acclimate a Fish1," Do this before you remove your fish from the carrying container, since fish are sensitive to light and may be traumatized by a sudden change in lighting.Once your fish is used to the tank, you can be less strict about lighting. It's a good idea to initially introduce your fish to a dim environment, as this will reduce the shock of being introduced to a new environment.;
, Your fish likely came in a bag from a pet store. If your fish did not come in a bag, you can transfer the fish and water to a small, plastic bag. Tie the end of the bag together and use a rubber band to seal the bag. It's important the bag is sealed tight, as your want your fish to stay in its original water for the initial 15 minutes.Simply set the bag on top of the water in the quarantine tank. The fish bag should float on the water's surface.
Set a timer for 15 minutes. Keep an eye on the bag during this time to make sure it does not fall over or come undone. For about 15 minutes, allow the bag to float. This way, the water in the bag will gradually become the same temperature as the water in the tank.

, Cut it just under the metal clip or rubber band keeping the bag closed. Roll down the top edges of the bag about an inch. This will create an air pocket. This pocket will allow the bag to float as you begin adding water from the tank to the bag.If you're acclimating a heavier fish, you may have to place the bag in a floatable device like a small tupperware container.

, Get a measuring cup. Add a half cup of the aquarium water to the bag. Allow the bag to float for another 4 minutes. When 4 minutes have passed, add another half cup of aquarium water to the bag.Keep adding water from the aquarium every 4 minutes until the bag is completely full.
How long this process will take varies. For a smaller bag, you may only need to add a couple of half cups. For a larger bag, you may need to add water 3 or 4 times before the bag is full.

, Once the bag is full, carefully lift it out of the water. Pour about half the water from the bag down the sink.After discarding the water, place the bag back in the quarantine tank. Allow the bag to start floating again.

, Once again, you will add half a cup of water to the bag every 4 minutes. Keep adding water from the tank until the bag is full.Once again, length will vary. For a small bag, you may only need to add a couple half cups. A larger bag may need to be filled 3 or 4 times until it's full.

, You will need a small net here. Dip your net into the bag and get your fish in the net. Gently lift the fish out of the bag and place it into the tank.Make sure to be gentle as you net your fish. You do not want your fish to become tangled in the netting. Use a slow, swooping gesture to capture your fish.
Be gentle, but quick, when you transfer your fish to the main water. You do not want your fish to be out of water for too long.

Gather your supplies.,
Float the fish initially.,
Transfer water to the bucket.,
Set up a siphon drip.,
Discard half the water once the water doubles.,
Transfer your fish to the main tank.",How to Acclimate a Fish2," For more sensitive fish, such as shrimp and sea stars, you may have to use the drip method. With the drip method, you set up a series of tubes running from the main tank to a bucket of water. You will need the following to use the drip method:You will need 3 or 5 gallon buckets, designed for aquarium use.
You will also need airline tubing.

, Fill the buckets a little under halfway full with clean aquarium water. You will need to start off by floating the fish to acclimate it to the water in the buckets.Let the sealed bag float for 15 minutes. Then, open the bag and roll the sides down to create an air tube that will keep the bag floating.
Add half a cup of the water from the bucket to the bag. Wait 15 minutes. Add another half cup. Keep going until the bucket is full.

, Gently lift up the bag. Pour the contents of the bag, including your fish, into the water.You may have to tilt the bag at a 45 degree angle when pouring. This will keep your fish fully submerged in water as you transfer it to the bucket.

, Place one end of the airline tube in the aquarium. You should also tie several very loose knots in the tubing. This will help regulate the flow of water and air. You want to get a rate of 2 or 4 drips per second.You can get water to start flowing by sucking gently on the other end of the tube.
Once water begins dripping, place the other end of the tube on the edge of the bucket.

, It may take awhile for the water in the bucket to double, so be patient. In general, it takes about an hour. As soon as the water doubles, carefully discard half the water. You may have to scoop out the water using a cup or smaller bucket to avoid dumping your fish.When you're done discarding the water, put your tubing back in place. Once again, suck on the end of the tube you're placing in the bucket to get a drip going.
Wait for the water in the bucket to double again.

, Use a bag to gently scoop out your fish. Gently pour the contents of the bag into the main aquarium.Some species of fish should never be exposed to air. Sponges, clams, and gorgonias cannot handle air. Be extra careful when transferring these types of fish.

Get your tank.,
Install a filtration system.,
Add a heater.,
Fill the aquarium with water from your main tank.,
Monitor your fish for 2 to 3 weeks in the quarantine tank.,
Repeat the floating process to transfer the fish to the regular tank.",How to Acclimate a Fish3," A quarantine tank is important as it keeps a fish away from the rest of your aquarium. It is highly reccomended you use a quarantine tank before acclimating your fish to your main aquarium. If a fish you just bought is sick, you do not want the infection to spread to the rest of your tank. After buying a new fish, purchase another tank to use as a quarantine tank.You do not need to get a fancy tank. A simple 10 to 20 gallon tank should be big enough for a quarantine tank.
You can purchase an aquarium at a pet store. You can also order one online.

, As with a regular aquarium, your quarantine tank should have some kind of filtration system. This will keep your fish safe and healthy during the quarantine period.If possible, go for a tank with a built in filtration system.
If your tank does not have a built in system, purchase a filtration system at a local pet shop. Install it in the tank when you get home, following manufacturer's instructions.

, This will keep the water at a safe temperature for your fish. You should also get a thermometer to record the temperature. You want to make sure the temperature is safe before transferring your fish to the quarantine tank.An aquarium may have a built in heating system. If yours does not, you can buy one at a pet store.
The proper temperature depends on the type of fish you have. Ask at the pet store what a safe temperature for your fish would be.

, The quarantine tank should be similar to your regular tank. Once your fish is ready to be transferred to the regular tank, you want the transition to be as smooth as possible.Take water from your main tank, using a bucket or cup, and fill up your quarantine tank.
Once the quarantine tank is full, you can turn on the heater and filtration system.

, Watch your fish closely during this time. Before introducing a fish to a tank of other aquatic life, you want to make sure it does not have any diseases. Diseases can spread fast in a fish tank.Common infections include things like fin rot, vibriosis, and mouth rot. Usually, you would treat infections with antibiotics. Antibiotics may be administered to a fish's tank, or you may give your fish food with antibiotics.
Symptoms of infections changes in color, frayed or rotting fins, a lack of appetite, gray marks on the scale and fins, and open sores on a fish.
If your fish has an infection, make sure it is treated and symptoms are gone before transferring your fish to the main aquarium.

, If two to three weeks pass without incident, you can transfer your fish to the regular tank. You would repeat the same floating process you used to acclimate your fish to the quarantine tank.You will have to net your fish and place it in a bag filled with water from the quarantine tank. Make sure to seal the bag with a metal clip or rubber band.
Float the bag in the regular tank for 15 minutes, cut the bag open, and roll down the edges an inch.
Transfer half a cup of water to the bag every 4 minutes until it's full. Discard half the water in the bag, and float it in the tank again. Once again, transfer water every 4 minutes until the bag is full.
Net the fish and transfer it into the main tank.

See our articles on setting up freshwater and marine aquariums for more information. Below is a brief checklist of things you'll want to do before getting started — this may not match all aquariums perfectly:


Assemble the aquarium
Add substrate
Add water
Add air stones, air pumps, etc.
Add plants, rocks, etc.
Add filtration system (and/or protein skimmer)
Add heater;
, Your goal in this cycling process is to populate the tank with fish that produce waste but can survive the initial high levels of toxins long enough for the beneficial waste-processing bacteria to grow. Thus, you'll want to pick a variety that is known for being a good cycling fish and start with a small number. Later, once the bacteria have grown, you can slowly add more fish of different types. Below are just a few good choices for cycling fish:White Clouds
Zebra Danios
Cherry or Tiger Barbs
Pseudotrophius Zebra
Banded Gouramis
X-ray Tetras
Pupfish
Most minnows
Most guppies

Note: When in doubt, ask a qualified staff member at a pet store for a recommendation.

, When cycling an aquarium with your fish, it's very important not to overfeed them. Though different fish may have different dietary needs, a good rule of thumb is to give food once every other day.Only offer a moderate-sized meal — you don't want any extra food left over when the fish are done eating. This is done for two reasons:


Fish who eat more produce more waste, which can cause the levels of toxins in the tank to rise before the bacteria have a chance to colonize the aquarium.
Leftover food will eventually rot, producing toxins on its own.

, While you're waiting for your tank to cycle, every few days, replace about 10-25% of the tank's water. As with the reduced feeding schedule described above, this is another way of ensuring that toxin levels don't get too high before the bacteria has a chance to grow. If you have a saltwater tank, don't forget to add a suitable amount of marine salt every time you change the water to keep the tank at a proper salinity.


Don't use chlorinated water — this can kill the bacteria in the tank, forcing the cycle to start over. If using tap water, make sure to treat it with an appropriate dechlorinator or water conditioner before adding it to your aquarium. If using bottled water, make sure to buy distilled water, as ""purified"" or ""drinking"" water may have minerals added for taste that may be harmful to fish.
Be ready to perform water changes much more frequently if you start to see signs of serious ammonia stress in your fish (more information below in the ""Solving Common Problems"" section.) However, try to avoid stressing the fish by exposing them to big changes in water chemistry or temperature.

, When you add fish to your tank, the levels of toxic chemicals known as ammonia and nitrites will quickly rise as the fish release waste into the water. As beneficial bacteria begin to grow in response to these chemicals, their levels will gradually drop to near-zero, at which point it's safe to add more fish. To monitor these chemicals, you can use commercially-available test kits, which are usually sold at the same places fish and aquariums are. Testing daily is ideal, but you can sometimes get away with testing every few days.You will want to keep ammonia levels below 0.5 mg/L and nitrite below 1 mg/L throughout the cycling process (ideally, they should be less than half of these values.)If these chemicals start to approach unsafe levels, increase the frequency of your water changes.
The cycling process is complete when both ammonia and nitrite levels drop so low that they are undetectable. For practical purposes, this is often referred to as ""zero,"" though this isn't technically accurate.As an alternative, you can take water samples to the pet store where you bought your fish or aquarium. Most will offer cheap testing services (some even do it for free!), The cycling process typically takes about six to eight weeks. Once ammonia and nitrite levels are so low that they aren't showing up on your tests, you may add more fish. However, you'll want to do this gradually, introducing just one or two new new fish at once. Adding just a few fish at a time keeps the increased amount of ammonia and nitrites in the tank from each new addition well within the ability of the bacteria to control.


After each addition of new fish, wait at least a week or so, then test the water once more. If ammonia and nitrite levels are still low, you may add your next few fish.

, For this method, we'll start with a fully-assembled tank, minus the fish, just like in the method above. However, this time, we won't add the fish until the entire cycle is completed. Instead, we'll add biological waste manually as we monitor the water level and wait for the cycle to complete.


This method requires a lot of patience, as it requires you to wait for the organic material you add to your tank to decay and start producing toxic waste products. However, it's often considered a more ""humane"" option as it doesn't expose fish to ammonia and nitrites like the method above does., To begin, drop just a few flakes of fish food into your tank — about as much as you'd use to feed your fish will do. Now, simply wait. Over the next few days, the flakes will begin to decay and release waste products (including ammonia) into the water.

, Use a test kit (or bring a water sample to your local pet store) to test your water for ammonia levels. You want to have a level of at least three parts per million (ppm). If you don't have enough ammonia in your water, add more flakes and wait for them to decay before testing again.

, Continue to test your water every other day for ammonia levels. As beneficial bacteria begins to grow in your aquarium, it will start to consume the ammonia, reducing the ammonia levels. Replenish them by adding fish flakes whenever the ammonia level falls below three ppm.

, As the bacteria start consuming ammonia, they'll begin to produce nitrites, the intermediate type of chemical in the nitrate cycle (which is less toxic than ammonia but still harmful to fish). Start testing for nitrites after a week or so — again, you can use a commercial test kit or take water samples to a pet shop to do this.


Once you detect nitrites, you'll know the cycle has started. At this point, you'll continue adding ammonia as you have before.

, As you feed the bacteria in the tank ammonia, the nitrite levels will continue to rise. Eventually, however, enough beneficial bacteria will grow to convert the nitrites into nitrates, the final type of chemical in the nitrate cycle (and one that isn't harmful to fish.) When this happens, you'll know the cycle is nearing completion.


You can detect this final phase of the cycle by either testing for nitrites (in which case you're looking for a sudden drop), nitrates (in which case you're looking for a sudden spike from a base level of zero), or both.

, After about six to eight weeks, the ammonia and nitrite levels should decrease to a level that's so low you can no longer detect them, while nitrate levels should plateau. At this point, it's safe to add your fish.However, as in the method above, you'll want to add your fish gradually. Don't add more than a few small fish at a time and wait at least a week or two before introducing your next batch of fish.
Consider cleaning the substrate with a siphon hose before adding fish, particularly if you had to add a lot of food. Decaying food or plant matter can become a ticking time bomb. If it gets trapped in the gravel, the ammonia won't enter the water, but if something upsets it, it could release a fair amount of ammonia rather quickly.

, Since cycling a tank can easily take up to six or eight weeks, aquarium owners have long been looking for ways to shorten this process. One proven way to do this is to introduce bacteria from a tank that's already been cycled to the new tank. Since you don't have to wait for the bacteria in your tank to start growing naturally, your tank should cycle quicker than it otherwise would. One great source of bacteria is a tank's filter — simply switch the filter media from the established tank to the new tank for a potential boost.


Try to use filter media from a tank that's a similar size and has a similar amount of fish. Mis-matching your filters (like, for instance, using a filter from a tank with just a few fish in it to cycle a tank with a greater number of fish) can leave you with greater loads of ammonia than the bacteria are able to process right away.

, In the same way as filter media can allow you to ""transplant"" bacteria from an established tank to a new one, an established tank's substrate (the gravelly material at the bottom) can give you the same effect. Simply add a few scoops of substrate on top of the tank's existing substrate to get the benefit.

, Living plants (as opposed to fake plastic ones) typically speed up the nitrogen cycle, especially if they're introduced from a mature tank. Not only can plants carry beneficial bacteria (just like the substances above), but they also pull ammonia out of the water directly to use in a biological process called protein synthesis.Fast-growing plant varieties (like, for instance, Vallisneria and Hygrophila) tend to absorb the most ammonia. Floating plants also generally work well., One possible downside of using filter media or substrate from one tank to transfer beneficial bacteria to another is that it's also possible to unwittingly transfer other organisms. Many parasites, invertebrates, and assorted microorganisms can be transferred in this way, so be aware of this possibility in advance and never transfer material from a tank that's known to be contaminated with harmful organisms.


Pests that can be transferred this way include snails, harmful algae, and parasites like ich and velvet., If you have a freshwater tank, adding a very small amount of salt can help your fish stay healthy when toxin levels are highest at the start of the cycling process.It does this by reducing the toxicity of nitrite, the intermediate chemical in the nitrate cycle. However, you'll want to use only 0.4 ounces per gallon of water at most — any more can be very stressful for freshwater fish.


Be sure to use certified aquarium salt — table salt isn't formulated for your tank and may hurt your fish.

, Ammonia stress (the dangerous symptoms that fish get when ammonia levels get to high) is always a risk during the cycling process. If they aren't dealt with quickly, these symptoms can eventually become deadly for the fish. If you see the symptoms below, lower the ammonia levels by changing the water more frequently and changing a greater portion of the water each time:Lethargy/lack of movement (even when food is added)
Refusing to leave the bottom of the tank
Gasping for air at the surface of the water
Inflamed eyes, gills, and/or anus.

, There are two kinds: remover and detoxifier. Most pet shops and aquarium stores will sell chemicals specifically designed to neutralize ammonia in aquariums. Though these can be useful if the ammonia level becomes so high that it begins to harm the fish, they are more useful in starting a new tank as they permit to skip some water changes, shortening the time needed to cycle a new tank.


Some people believe that ammonia removers can be harmful in the long-run. This may be due to a misunderstanding of the process of detoxifying. In a tank, toxic ammonia (gas NH3) is in reversible equilibrium with not-so-toxic ionized ammonia (NH4+). Most of the detoxifier  products convert toxic ammonia into the form that isn't so harmful to fish. However, after 24 to 48 hours, they will release the ammonia. That's why these products should be used:

as long as the useful bacteria is not yet established AND,
from time to time make a partial water change (as per manufacturers' instructions) to remove some of the ammonia accumulatedAND
even if is not specified, dose the detoxifier for the whole tank, not just for the new added (replaced) water, as the already bonded ammonia in the tank will be released soon (after 24-48 hours from previous dose).


Changing 50% of the water (or more) generally prolongs the time required to cycle the tank (or even stop the cycle) just because the useful bacteria will be temporary inhibited and will need time to adapt to new pH.. For this reason, some recommend a pH change of less than 0.2-0.3 per day. Suppose you have 7.8 pH in tank, replacing 25% with water of pH=7 will bring the final pH to 7.6.
Useful bacteria transforms only ionized (non-toxic) form of ammonia, so they benefit from these products also..

, Though they're often thought of as the quintessential aquarium fish, goldfish are actually not recommended for cycling a tank. The problem with goldfish stems from the facts that they have different care requirements than the types of tropical fish that are most common in aquariums today. Thus, cycling a tank with goldfish and then adjusting the tank to accommodate tropical fish can cause at least some of the bacteria to die from the higher heat and different water conditions.This stresses the goldfish, the bacteria, and the tropical fish — not a recipe for a healthy tank.


In addition, modern goldfish are somewhat susceptible to diseases that can easily spread through the entire aquarium.You won't want to cycle any aquarium with so-called ""feeder"" goldfish, which are poorly-cared for by breeders and sellers and are extra-susceptible to disease."

You cannot keep a 20 inch (50.8 cm) fish in a 20 gallon (75.7 L) tank, the poor fish would barely have room to turn. What fish you chose for your tank depends on how much waste the fish produces, and how much space it needs. AqAdvisor.com is a great stocking calculator to help you stock your tank. Try to stay under 85% stocking.

Anything less than 5 gallons (18.9 L) is not suitable for a fish, not even a Betta, you could keep some snails, or a group of shrimp, but that's it. A Betta needs a proper 5 gallon (18.9 L) tank with filter and heater. ;
, If you want fish other then a Betta, get a 10 gallon (37.9 L) or larger. Goldfish are not considered beginner fish if you want a small tank. Fancy goldfish require 40 gallons (151.4 L) at least, and common goldfish require hundreds of gallons, and do better in a pond. Good beginner fish are guppies, platies, tetras, Danios, white cloud minnows, Colorado catfish, Betta fish, and dwarf gourmands. Other aquatic pets like shrimp or snails can also be fantastic. Research the fish you want, see what size tank it needs, what its water requirements are, is it compatible with the other fish, how big it gets, etc. Do all of this and purchase supplies, and set up the tank and let it run for few days before purchasing the fish., Tropical fish like water in the high 70s to low 80's, goldfish like water in the low or mid 70's, they are not compatible.
, They probably don't even know a thing about fish. Instead, go online to fish forums and research sites to find out more details from the experts.
, Pet stores often don't tell you about cycling your tank, another reason not to trust them. The basics of cycling are as follows: All fish produce ammonia, which is toxic and will kill them in small amounts. They produce it when they poop and breathe. Rotting plants and food will also produce ammonia, so it's important to keep your tank clean. To remove the ammonia, a bacteria has to grow in the filter which eats the ammonia. This bacteria eats ammonia and produces nitrites. Nitrites are also toxic to fish, however, so it's important that another bacteria establishes to eat the nitrite and turn it into nitrate. Nitrate is only toxic in large amounts, so weekly 25% water changes are recommended in a well-stocked tank to keep the nitrates down and remove any debris. A good website for information on the nitrogen cycle is Fish lore.com. They have a good article on several methods to cycle your tank, and have a great, active forum where experts will give you advice. , All fish need a filter, because it is difficult to cycle a tank without one. A great brand is Aqua clear, as they are reliable and customizable. All tropical fish need a heater! Even if your house is warm, the temperature will fluctuate, making the fish get stressed out. Get a heater, and set it to 78 °F (26 °C) for tropical fish. Remember that some tropical fish like Cordilleras like cooler water in the low 70's, while other fish like Betta like warmer water in the high 70's to low 80's. It's also important that your heater is reliable. Emmie heaters are good, but there are many out there! Be sure to research, and let your tank run with the heater for a few days to ensure the temperature is right. Purchase a cheap, glass thermometer from the pet store to tell you if the temperature is right.
, Some fish like tetras, Corydoras catfish, and danios need to be in a group of 5 or more to feel safe, if you do not keep them in a group, they will get stressed and die.
, Only feed your fish a pinch twice a day, and remove any leftover food. Skip a feeding once a week, it will give the fish some time to clear out its system. Don't worry, the fish is not going to starve, fish can go up to a week without food. Feed your fish flakes as a staple, and add in live, frozen or freeze dried foods as a treat once or twice a week. Soak freeze dried foods in a cup of aquarium water for 5 minutes before feeding your fish, this is so it doesn't expand in your fishes stomach, making it swim funny. Also feed your fish nothing but a pea once a week. Prepare the pea by putting it in a bowl with some water and putting it in the microwave for 10 seconds. then remove the skin and feed a tiny bit.

Some fish, like corydora catfish, need sinking pellets, so the pinch rule doesn't apply.

, It can hurt your fish even more., It's better then floating the bag. Floating the bag only makes the fish used to the temperature, not the water conditions. Research acclimation methods and chose which you will use before purchasing fish. , It does not matter what size the tank is or what kind of filter it has. You should also use a gravel vacuum to vacuum the gravel, but do not go too deep, you don't want to remove all the good bacteria!
, The good bacteria lives in the filter media, so changing the cartridge will remove most of the bacteria. Only replace the cartridge when it is falling apart, and even then you should keep some of it in the tank until the new cartridge has some new bacteria on it. You can swish it in some old aquarium water when changing the water to clean it.

, The saying about keeping a bucket of tap water out for 24 hours will remove the chlorine is true, but chlorine and heavy metals do not dissipate in the air. Water conditioners like Prime by Sachems or Miquela Plus are good ones.
, Pet stores use inaccurate strips to test water, so if you're going to a pet store to test your water, then you're getting incorrect readings. Getting a liquid test kit and testing your water yourself is better. The API Liquid Freshwater Master Test Kit is recommended.

, When one culture starts clearing up or turns pink you will have infusoria. The reason it clears up is because infusoria eats bacteria.

, Pour your good culture into the other culture.

, Feed your fry a few drops at a time so the tank stays clean. Don't overfeed, it will make the water green.

Choose the right fish.,
Select the feeding place.,
Start slowly.,
Move your hand closer to the fish as they feed.,
Try food in your hand once you feel certain that the fish are used to your presence and your hand.,
Set your hand into the water, and don’t make fast movements or the fish won't take the food.,
Continue the feeding by hand regularly.",How to Hand Feed a Fish," Some fish tolerate human presence more than others and some fish are not shy about coming close. Koi, Black Ghost Knife fish, and Goldfish are three very good examples of very sociable fish that live in harmony with humans that are very happy to get close, and will often take food from a human hand.;
, Whether it is going to be your own pond, your aquarium tank or even a local park, it is important to choose one place that you will always treat as your ""feeding spot"". The feeding spot should be free of sudden noises (such as splashing water), sudden movements (such as other humans walking by) and too much light/shade contrast.

, At first, just throw the fish food into the water and observe the fish as they eat. Make your presence obvious (that is, don't move away). The first fish to eat will be those that are bravest. Their determination to eat will encourage the less courageous to come along later. You may need to repeat this process of the fish just getting used to your presence several times.

, After a few tries with you standing close to the fish, start to stretch out your hand towards them. Leave it hovering above them for a short time as they feed, so that they can see it.

, One way to observe their familiarity with you is when you see the fish getting excited by your presence, as they have come to associate your being around with receiving food. Do this at the same time as your other attempts at getting the fish used to you, with the same food and in the same place as before.

, Release some of the food into the water and leave your hand outstretched with some food still in it. Wait for the boldest fish to come close. Again, this may take several attempts before the fish feel comfortable enough to share from your hand.

, If you want to continue feeding your fish by hand, practice it regularly so that they remain friendly towards you and are not scared by your hand. It remains important to keep a regular method so that the fish are not spooked; this is less a problem once koi are trained but might be a problem with smaller, more delicate fish.

Get a water container for your larvae.,
Fill your bucket with water.. Clean water often lacks the nutrients mosquito larvae need to survive.,
Place the bucket in a shady area.,
Wait for mosquitos to lay their eggs in the water.,
Use an eye dropper or small net to catch your larvae.,
Place unhatched egg boats in your fish tank.,
Capture larvae “wrigglers” and place them in your fish tank.,
Harvest your larvae weekly.,
Dispose of dead larvae.",How to Raise Mosquito Larvae for Fish Food," There are many container options that you can choose from to grow mosquito larvae. Larger containers will permit you to grow more larvae, but remember that the larvae you don’t harvest will eventually hatch into mosquitos in your yard. Make sure to use a new or clean food grade container. Do not use one that has held paint, tar, or other chemicals as the chemicals will poison the algae or larva.A five-gallon bucket is an excellent choice for your water source, but if you have a large number of fish you intend to feed, you may want to go with something as large a 50-gallon barrel.
A one-quart container can provide you with enough mosquito larvae to feed most hobbyist’s fish.;
, If you allow rain water to fill your bucket or other container it will create an environment that can more easily sustain the larvae you hope to breed. You may not want to wait long enough for your bucket or container to fill with rain water. If you choose to use tap water, it's important that you treat the water to make it safe for mosquito larvae, otherwise the chlorine may prevent algae growth, which is the larvae’s primary food source.Leave debris that falls into the water. It will add to the bacterial growth mosquito larvae will feed off of.
Treat the tap water with a dechlorinator that will neutralize the chlorine content that may be present in your tap water.
Dechlorinator kits can be purchased at most pet or aquarium stores.

, Mosquitos thrive in dirty, shaded water sources. Avoid placing the bucket in direct sunlight, as the water may become too warm for larvae to survive on hot days. You may spill some water while moving the bucket, but it does not have to be full to work.Place the bucket under an overhang or dense tree growth to keep it shaded from the sun.
It’s okay if sunlight reaches the bucket at times, but position it so it doesn not receive direct sunlight for too much of the day.

, There are very few retailers that sell mosquito larvae, so you will need to wait for mosquitos to come and lay eggs in your water source. Depending on where you live, this may only happen during the spring and summer months. It will likely only take a week or two to notice mosquito eggs in your water source.Mosquito eggs will look like tiny rafts of dark brown eggs. These egg rafts tend to hatch within 48 hours.
When mosquito eggs hatch, they release what looks like abdomens with two antennae. These hatchlings are commonly referred to as “wrigglers” and are the larvae you can feed to your fish.
If you do not see any eggs in your bucket within a week or two, consider moving it to another part of your yard. The water may be becoming too warm (if in sunlight) or too cold.

, Mosquito larvae are very small, so make sure you purchase a small aquarium net designed to capture tiny aquatic life. Nets designed for brine shrimp will work perfectly. You can also use an eye dropper to capture individual or small groups of eggs or larvae.Make sure to transfer the larvae or eggs into your aquarium quickly so they don’t die before your fish can eat them.
Pouring your water container into your aquarium is not advised, as you may not want to introduce the algae and debris in the mosquito’s water to your tank.

, Most fish probably will not immediately eat the small egg “boats” but they will attack the “wrigglers” or larvae as they emerge from the eggs. This is the best way to ensure your mosquito larvae don’t grow into full grown pests in your backyard.


It’s okay if your fish eat the egg boats before they hatch.
These eggs will usually hatch within 48 hours of being laid, so you may not find them very often.

, You are much more likely to encounter larvae than unhatched eggs because of how quickly eggs hatch. Mosquito larvae will come to the surface regularly to breath. Larvae will shed their skin as they grow, so you may find empty bits of larvae skin. Fish are unlikely to eat shed skin.Larvae appear to have antennae which are actually siphon tubes used for breathing.
Larvae that enters the pupa stage will look as though they have developed a head and will no longer feed on algae. These can be fed to fish, but should otherwise be washed down the drain as it is the last stage before flying.

, Even if you have more larvae than you can feed your fish, it’s important that you purge your developing larvae on a weekly basis. Depending on the environment, mosquito eggs can develop into full grown, flying pests in as little as four days or as long as two weeks.To avoid cultivating a swarm of mosquitoes in your yard, purge any larvae your fish don’t eat by pouring the water down the drain.
Pouring your water out in your yard may not prevent the larvae from becoming full grown mosquitoes.

, Your fish likely will not eat dead larvae, so if some do not survive you can simply discard them with the water as you change it each week. If all of the larvae is dying, there is an issue with the temperature or quality of the water.


If you used tap water, there may have still been some chlorine present. Chlorine will kill mosquito larvae.
If your bucket received direct sunlight at some point of the day, it may be becoming too hot for larvae to survive in the water.

Research your fish species.,
Find a fish food specific to your fish if possible.,
Pick food that floats, sinks, or slowly sinks depending on your fish's mouth shape.,
Check the protein content of the fish food.,
Make sure your food is small enough for your fish to eat.,
Look up fish food companies online.",How to Feed Fish1," People at the store where you purchased your fish should be able to help you pick out a fish food if you cannot find information specific to your species online. Find out whether your fish are herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores, and ideally the exact % of protein the fish species requires in its diet. Some exotic species require special diets, but most fish can be fed basic ""fish food"" flakes or pellet. However, don't go rushing to the pet store yet.;
, Many aquarium fish are fed with a general purpose fish food, or one intended for a broad category such as ""tropical fish."" As long as you read this section carefully, your fish may do fine with the right type of general food. However, if you can find a fish food specific to your fish species or group of related species, your fish will most likely be healthier and happier. These should be labeled clearly as ""cichlid food,"" ""betta food,"" etc.


It's still a good idea to follow the other steps in this section to check a fish food's suitability before purchasing it.

, You can ask an aquarium store employee for advice if necessary, but often watching your fish's behavior or mouth shape will be enough to find out what type of food to buy. Bottom feeders such as catfish spend time at the bottom of the tank, with their down-turned or underside mouths searching for food. Mid-feeders have mouths pointing straight ahead and search for food in the middle of the tank. Surface feeders have upturned mouths and cluster to the surface when they are fed.If you are unsure what type your fish is, simply try out a food and see if they successfully find and eat it; some fish may not be restricted to one area.Flake food floats, and is only suitable for surface feeders.

Grain, granule, or pellet food may float, sink slowly, or sink rapidly. Try to find more information on the label before buying.

Wafer food sinks to the bottom, and is usually too large to be ""stolen"" by surface feeders.

Tablet food can be dropped to the bottom of the tank, or, sometimes, stuck to the inside wall of the aquarium to provide food for mid-feeders.

, Use the results of your research to narrow down the type of fish food to buy. Herbivores and omnivores require fish food made mostly from vegetable material, such as spirulina. Depending on species, their fish food should contain anywhere from 5% to 40% protein, so research the species thoroughly to narrow down your options. Carnivores, on the other hand require a diet between 45% and 70% protein, depending on species.Make sure the fish food you buy matches the needs of your fish.


Bettas are carnivores and surface feeders. Their food should contain at least 45% protein, float, and be small enough to fit in the betta's mouth. Betta food is often sold in the form of tiny pellets.Goldfish are omnivores, and require 30% protein as adults, or 45% as young fish. Aquatic plant proteins are easiest for them to digest.They are surface feeders, so flakes are a good choice.

, Many fish swallow their food whole, which means they are unable to break apart large flakes or pellets that do not fit inside their mouth. If the food you are giving your fish is going untouched, or if it looks bigger than your fish's mouth, crush it into pieces before feeding or find a smaller type of food.

, Before purchasing a dry fish food, search for the brand name and reviews. Well-respected companies that get good reviews from aquarium hobbyists are more likely to make high-quality fish food."
"
Feed in tiny portions.,
Soak pellet foods before feeding.,
Feed the fish once or twice a day.,
Look for signs of overfeeding.,
Spread out the food so everyone gets some.,
Watch for problems if you have multiple types of fish.,
Consider your options while away on vacation.",How to Feed Fish2," While many people have heard that fish require a ""pinch"" of flake food each feeding, giving them too large a pinch can give the fish digestive problems or make the tank dirty and unhealthy. Whatever type of dry food you are using, only put in as much food as your fish can eat in 3 to 5 minutes.If you put too much food in the tank, scoop it out with a fine net.



Warning: Betta fish should be fed much less than they can eat in 5 minutes. Two or three small pellets per betta is sufficient., Because many aquarium fish have small stomachs, pellets that absorb water and expand in size may cause digestive problems or bloating in your fish. Soak the pellets in water for 10 minutes before feeding so they expand before the fish eat it, rather than in the fish's stomach., Because it is much easier to overfeed most fish than to give them too little food, one feeding a day may be safer. However, if you are careful to give them small amounts of food as described above, you may feed the fish twice a day. Some aquarium owners prefer this because the fish become more active and interesting to watch during feeding.

, If a trail of poop is hanging from your fish, their intestine may be partially blocked due to overfeeding or the wrong type of food.If the water gets dirty enough that you need to do a water change more than once a week, you may be overfeeding the fish, or the tank may be overcrowded. Reduce the amount of food per serving or the number of servings per day to see if the problem goes away within a few days. Ask an aquarium store employee or fish raising hobbyist for advice if it does not.

, Even within the same species, the larger or more aggressive fish may not leave enough food for the other fish. Reduce the chance of this happening by dividing the food and adding it to more than one area of the tank, or by sprinkling it evenly across the entire water surface.

, If you have fish in your tank that feed in different areas of the tank, or on different types of food, you will likely need to purchase more than one fish food. Watch mixed-species tanks closely during feeding when you start them on a new food. You may need to find different combinations of food or feeding times if the fish at the surface eat all the food intended for the fish at the bottom. If some of your fish are active during the day and others at night, feeding them at two different times may help ensure that each fish gets enough food., Leaving adult fish alone without food for a few days is almost always safe, and if you research your fish species online you may discover they can survive without serious risk for one or two weeks.For longer trips, or for young fish with more urgent food requirements, you'll need a way to feed them while you're gone. Choose from one of the following solutions:Use an automatic feed dispenser to dispense food at regular intervals. Make sure you supply enough food for the whole time you'll be away, and set the dispenser to release food once or twice a day.
Test a feeder block or gel feeder before leaving. These blocks of dry or gel-covered food are left in the tank and eaten slowly. However, the dry blocks may cause dangerous chemical changes, while the gel variety sometimes go ignored. Test either variety for a few days before leaving so you can be sure there are no problems.
Have a friend or neighbor feed them their usual flake food once every two or three days. Because inexperienced feeders often give too much food, it's best to place each pinch of food in a pillbox or other container with the day of the week carefully marked on it. Make it clear to the caretaker that overfeeding could kill your fish.

Obtain these supplements from safe sources.,
Feed carnivorous fish live or frozen animals.,
Feed most fish vegetables or algae.,
Feed your fish a variety of these supplements for greater health.,
Provide straight vitamins or minerals if you notice problems.,
Seek specific advice for raising newborn fish.",How to Feed Fish3," Insects, worms, and other animal food is most safely obtained at a pet store or aquarium store, while plant matter should be organically grown away from roadside exhaust. If a local aquarium expert tells you that collecting animals or plants from outdoors is safe in your area, then you may follow her advice. Otherwise, understand that collecting these supplements yourself carries the risk of disease, parasites, or harmful chemicals.

, One to three times a week, give your fish frozen or live insects and other animal foods instead of their usual feeding. Always research your fish species' needs or ask an expert before selecting a food, as some foods can transmit disease or cause digestive issues when fed to certain species. Common foods available at pet shops include bloodworms, tubifex worms, daphnia, and brine shrimp. As with any feeding, only provide tiny amounts of food; enough to eat within 30 seconds may be enough for some species.



Warning: Freeze-dried foods are another option, but should only be used occasionally due to the digestive issues large amounts can cause in some species, such as bettas.Avoid live tubifex worms, even ones sold at pet stores and raised on fish farms. They are known to cause diseases in many species, although the frozen variety is typically safe., Herbivores and omnivores will likely be healthier and more colorful if you supplement their diet with the occasional plant matter, and even many carnivorous species can eat plants for useful nutrients. As always, research your fish species online before feeding it a new food. You can attach a piece of vegetable inside the tank with a vegetable clip, or cut it into small pieces to feed to your fish. Be sure to remove any uneaten vegetables within 48 hours, or it will start to rot in your tank.


Carrots, zucchini, cucumbers, carrots, lettuce, and peas are just a few of the vegetables your fish might enjoy. Feed once every few days or as advised for your species.
Using spirulina powder, infusoria, algae, or other plant matter sold at aquarium shops is another option, and a necessary one for tiny, juvenile fish too small to eat vegetable pieces. As long as the tank's surface or walls doesn't become overgrown with algae, you may add it according to instructions once or twice a day.

, Different animals or vegetables provide different vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Alternate between two or three types of animal or meat (for carnivorous fish) or vegetables (for other fish) for a better chance at providing all the requirements for healthy fish.

, If your fish's bright colors fade, they become less active, or you notice other signs of poor health, your fish may be lacking certain nutrients. It's best to seek expert advice to gain a better idea of which vitamins or minerals your fish needs, or to identify other problems. Fish may need these supplements during times of stress, such as when new fish are introduced to the tank.If you are raising live food yourself, or purchasing live food from pet shops, you may feed them mineral or vitamin supplements which then get digested by the predator fish. This technique is called ""gut loading.""

, Newborn fish, or fish fry, are often too small to eat ordinary fish food. Because their dietary needs are often different than the adult fish, and they may require feeding every few hours, it's vital to seek specific advice based on the species. Research information online to make sure your fish fry have the best chance of survival.

Measure the specific gravity of your tank.,
Adjust the tank's salinity if needed.,
Transfer your fish to the tank.",How to Acclimate Salt Water Fish1," The specific gravity of a body of water is its relative salinity in relation to pure water. A higher specific gravity means that there is a higher percentage of salt dissolved in that water.You can measure the specific gravity using a refractometer. These devices can be purchased through an online retailer or from some pet stores.


Place one or two drops of salt water into the refractometer.
Hold the device towards a light source and look through the lens.
Record the specific gravity reading in the lens.
The ideal specific gravity of a reef aquarium is between 1.023 and 1.025. The ideal specific gravity of a fish only with live rock (FOWLR) aquarium is 1.020 to 1.025.;
, If your tank has a higher or lower specific gravity than your fish's transportation bag, you'll need to adjust your tank's salinity accordingly. Note that it's easier for a fish to adjust to a lower salinity than a higher salinity. An increase in water salinity is more likely to shock a fish than a decrease.You can lower the salinity of your aquarium water by diluting it with clean, fresh water.
You can raise your aquarium's salinity by adding more aquarium salt to your tank.
Remember that making these changes to a tank that's already populated with fish could stress or kill those fish. For this reason, you'll want to use a quarantine tank to acclimate your new fish before adding it to your primary aquarium.

, Once you've adjusted your aquarium's specific gravity to meet your fish's transportation bag, your fish can be transferred into the aquarium. Make sure the tank's temperature and pH are acceptable for your fish, then use a fine mesh fish net to carefully transfer your fish into the tank.Try to avoid pouring any water from the transportation bag into the aquarium.

Set up your refugium.,
Set up the refugium with a habitat for the copepods.,
Stock the refugium with live copepods.,
Once you have obtained the starter culture of copepods, bring them home and allow them to reach room temperature.,
Once the copepods are in the refugium, your only job is to let them grow and reproduce.",How to Grow Copepods," The refugium will have water flowing from the display tank into it (often times under the display tank out of sight), through other chambers where filters, media, protein skimmers, deep-sand beds, etc. will go, then water will flow out and back into the display tank. Ensure that protein skimmers and filters are in chambers where water will flow before going into the refugium, or the copepods will not make it to the display tank.;
, This will include sand (like in the display tank) live rock, and macroalgae. All of these items are available at local saltwater fish stores. Macro algae like caulerpa mexicana are recommended, which looks like a fern plant, because it grows like crazy and gives the copepods many areas to hide and breed. Since you will have live plants, it will be important to give them light. You can either purchase a hood for the refugium or make one, but the cheapest method is to get a clippable desk light and clip it securely to the side of the refugium, so the light sits about eight to twelve inches above the water.

, Selection of a good starter batch is important. Fish stores will often have just one type of copepods to choose from, and they will usually work fine. They should be sold in a bottle, which is usually refrigerated. Ensure that you examine the bottle in the light - the more copepods you see swimming around, and the more diversity you see in their sizes, the better. Alternately, you can order copepods online (at a very good price). Some bottles even have both amphepods and copepods in the same bottle - this will work well, too.

, Some people choose to add half the bottle at one point, refrigerating the rest for about a week, then adding the rest. Once the bottle has reached room temperature, you can add them to your refugium. It is fine to just dump them in; however, turning off the pump and dumping some in quickly and adding some gently to the top will ensure that more of the copepods are able to settle into the refugium without being immediately pumped into your tank (where they will quickly become yummy treats for the inhabitants).

, While the copepods that you purchased were tiny little specs in the bottle, the adults look significantly different. A mature copepod capable of reproducing looks like a little creepy crawly bug, with legs that they use to crawl along the macro algae and refugium walls and a body that seems to curl under itself when they are not moving. It is not uncommon to find them as adults that are up to half an inch long.To ensure that the copepods continue to thrive, keep a good supply of macro algae in the refugium and let them be. Refrain from reaching your hand in their home and shaking the algae to release them into the tank. Remember, the more copepods you have in your refugium, the more will continue to reproduce. The baby copepods will be ejected into your tank, and your fish will have great snacks.

Use this method unless you know the place you got it from uses best practices, especially if you have a saltwater tank.,
Always keep a small 10-20 gallon, low or no light tank, treated with copper or other typical treatments.,
Put all new fish into this tank.,
Take the bucket and add 2 cups of water from the main take to the bucket about every 5 minutes.",How to Acclimate Your Fish to a New Aquarium1," The problem is the disease or parasites are in the water and on the fish. Even if you transfer the fish without the water into your tank, the fish can still carry parasites and disease. Without putting the fish into quarantine you really have no idea what you are introducing into your tank. Unless you treat the fish first, or know for sure the store has, you are risking your entire tank.


There are reputable dealers who ""self quarantine"" their fish. They have a medically treated tank which the keep the fish in for 1-3 weeks before putting them into the display tanks for sale. If you know for sure that is who you are buying from, then the methods suggested below are safe. Net the fish after it's acclimated to the tank water temp.
Some stores keep their fish in treated water (copper or other types of treatments). This is good, but if you put that water into your tank, and it's a reef invertebrate tank, you can lose all your inverts.
Some stores just dump all their fish into one common system. Their strategy is the fish will only be in their store a short time and not long enough to show symptoms or die before it's sold. If it does, they just dispose of it or offer the customer a partial or full refund. So once you dump it into your tank it's game over. Some of these are discounters that 'churn and burn' their inventory. They don't care about the fish, it's just stock to them.
For freshwater tanks, it's not a problem. Float the bags and dump the fish is fine. If it's a freshwater tank you probably have had medication in the tank already.;
, Keep a few cleaner wrasses in there, maybe a 4-6"" pipe or something where the fish can feel safe.

, After 7-30 days of no symptoms, drain some of the water into a bucket (1 gallon is fine) and you net the fish into the bucket. The time frame depends on the life cycle of parasites and the temperature of the water. Higher temperatures mean a shorter life cycle and less time in the quarantine tank.

, After you have doubled the water (now 2 gallons) net the fish and put them in the main tank. Keep a floating thermometer in the bucket to make sure you're within one degree of tank water. Sometimes a heater is needed, but usually not.

"
"
Test the pH of your bag's water.,
Adjust your tank's pH to match the bag's pH.,
Transfer your fish to the tank.",How to Acclimate Salt Water Fish2," Since your fish is acclimated to the pH of its transportation bag's water, you will need to adjust the aquarium's pH accordingly. You can purchase home aquarium pH testing kits from your local pet store or through an online retailer., Once you have a reading of the bag's pH, you'll need to take a reading of your aquarium's pH and raise or lower it as needed. Remember to wear protective gloves and eyewear, as pH chemicals are typically able to burn or corrode any surfaces they come into contact with (including your body).Use sodium bisulfate to lower your aquarium water's pH.
Some experts recommend adding 2.5 grams of sodium bisulfate per 10 gallons of water to reduce the alkalinity by 1.0 pH. You can adjust accordingly to correct your tank's pH.
Dissolve the sodium bisulfate in a cup of fresh, clean water, then transfer it to the tank.
Again, remember to use a quarantine tank if you're introducing a new fish to a tank that already contains fish. Adjusting the pH of a tank full of fish could shock them.

, Once the temperatures are equal, you can transfer your fish from the transportation bag to the aquarium. You should still be floating the transportation bag in the aquarium to adjust the water temperature inside the bag. Use a net to transfer your fish to the aquarium and discard the bag and its water.Over the next few days, bring the tank's pH back to normal by performing 10 to 15 percent water exchanges using fresh salt water every other day.

Assess whether the drip method will work.,
Turn off all aquarium lights.,
Dim the lights in the room.,
Float the sealed bag in your tank.,
Transfer the bag water and fish to a clean bucket.,
Siphon water from your aquarium to the bucket.,
Allow your tube to drip for one hour.,
Transfer your fish to the aquarium.",How to Acclimate Salt Water Fish3," The drip method works best if your fish has been in its bag for a maximum of four to five hours or less. If your fish has been in its bag for longer than four to five hours, you'll want to use the floating method., Remember that bright lights can affect the temperature of a fish tank. If your fish was transported in a dark environment, being in a bright tank could also cause severe stress or trauma., Though most fish won't need to be in a totally dimmed room, your fish may need a dim room if it's been in a dark environment for a prolonged period of time. This is particularly common when fish are shipped through the mail inside a box or package., The easiest way to acclimate your fish to the tank's temperature is to let the transportation bag float in your aquarium. Do not open the bag yet; simply let the tank's temperature warm or cool your fish's transportation bag until they have equalized.15 minutes is typically a sufficient span of time for your fish's bag water to adjust to the aquarium's temperature.

, Open the bag and gently pour out the water and your fish into the bucket. There should not be any other water in the bucket at this time. If possible, try to use one designated bucket for nothing other than cleaning your tank and acclimating your fish.If the bag water does not sufficiently fill the bucket, you may have to tip the bucket at an angle to ensure that your fish remains completely submerged. Otherwise, your fish may be exposed to too much air, which could be fatal.
You can keep the bucket tipped by putting a sturdy block of wood, brick, or old book under one side of the bucket. Just be sure that the bucket will remain upright and not tip over.

, Use aquarium air line tubing to transfer water from your tank into the bucket. You'll need to regulate the flow of water to ensure that it doesn't siphon off too quickly. The ideal rate of flow of your aquarium's water into the bucket is three or four drops per second.You can control the flow of water by tying a loose knot into the tubing.
If you have an air control valve, this can help you regulate the flow of water more accurately. If not, simply tighten or loosen your tube knot as needed.

, One hour of steady dripping should be a sufficient span of time for your fish to acclimate to the aquarium's water. If you're using a small bucket and it fills up before one hour, pour off and discard some of the water in the bucket and continue the dripping process until one hour has passed., After an hour of dripping has passed, your fish will be ready to enter its new home. Carefully scoop up your fish using a fine-mesh net, then transfer it to the aquarium. Pour the bucket water back into your aquarium until it reaches your desired fill line. Discard any unused water from the bucket."

Establish a dim environment.,
Float the sealed bag in the tank for 15 minutes.,
Create an air pocket in the bag's lip.,
Pour out half of the bag's water.,
Add aquarium water to the bag in increments.,
Transfer your fish to the aquarium.",How to Acclimate Salt Water Fish4," Before using the floating method, you'll want to turn down the aquarium lights and possibly the lights in the room. Turning off the aquarium lights can help you fine tune the water temperature, while dimming the room's lights can help reduce the risk of shock if your fish was transported in a dark environment., Much like the drip method, the floating method requires that you let your fish's sealed transportation bag float on the surface of the aquarium for 15 minutes. This helps equalize the temperatures to reduce the risk of shock when you transfer your fish into the tank., You'll want to keep the bag floating on the water's surface, but you need to be able to adjust how much water is in the bag. The easiest way to do this is by creating an air pocket in the lip of the bag as you open the top.Cut the bag open just below the clip or knot, keeping it sealed.
Roll the top edge of the bag's opening down. You don't have to roll it down too far; about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) should suffice.

, Pour off half the bag's water directly down the drain, but be careful that you don't accidentally pour out your fish as well. Do not add any of the transportation bag's water to your aquarium, as it is likely filled with waste products like ammonia and nitrites.It's important that you immediately return the bag to the tank, allowing it to float on the surface of your aquarium's water. However, make sure no bag water escapes into the tank.

, Now that you've reduced the quantity of water in the transportation bag, you can begin adding aquarium water to raise or lower the bag water's temperature as needed.This process will take a while, so be patient and don't rush it or your fish could get shocked by the sudden change in temperature.


Start by adding a half cup of aquarium water to the bag your fish is in.
Wait four minutes, then add another half cup.
Repeat this process until the bag is filled with aquarium water.

, Once the bag has been filled with aquarium water, your fish will have finished adjusting to the temperature of its new environment. Use a net to scoop your fish out of the bag. Then immediately transfer it to the aquarium, since it should be acclimated to the water by this point.Discard the bag and its water when you're finished. Do not allow the transportation bag's water to mix with your aquarium water, as this may alter the pH and salinity of your water.

, Tie a simple overhand knot in the tubing. Place one end in the aquarium and the other in an empty bucket, lower down. Suck on the dry end to get the siphon started, then watch the flow. Tighten or loosen the knot until only a drip comes out, aiming for about 1 drip per second.


You may use a clamp instead to clamp the tube nearly closed.

, Stand the bag in a fish-safe container that holds ½ to 1 gallon (2–4 liters). Gently pour the water and fish from the bag into the container. If the water would be too shallow for the fish, just stand the open bag upright with the fish inside.

, Siphon the tank water again, this time into the container with the fish. Let it fill up until you've transferred ½ gallon (2 liters) of aquarium water.

, Do not pour any water back into the tank, as it may contain undesirable substances or organisms from the pet store.

If it's a brand new tank make sure the filter has been running for at least a week, preferably two weeks, so enough bacteria builds up in the filter to process nitrates (for small fish tanks a nitrite peak builds up after around 10 days).
Add all the ornaments/gravel and plants before you put in the new fish. Aquatic plants (if any) need time to build up roots and get used to the tank too. Fertilisers and possible dirt in the gravel have to set on the floor and break down.
Put in the correct amount of tap safe or chlorine inhibitor for the amount of water in the tank.
If you are adding the fish to an existing tank, rearrange the decorations. This will break up the territories of other fish, reducing the potential for aggression toward the newcomer.

, The seller will usually place the fish in a plastic bag for transport. On your way home, cover the fish with a towel, paper bag, or your shirt, since changes in light will stress fish out.


Don't worry if your fish dulls in color on its trip. This is caused by stress and your fish will recover quickly after it is in its new home.

, Untie the bag, and then place the bag carefully to prevent the water in the bag from mixing with the tank water. If the bag doesn't float and keeps tipping over, tape one side of it to the side of the tank. The water in the bag will gradually change temperature to match the tank, preventing injury and death from a sudden temperature change.


If the bag is untied, you can wait a full hour to be cautious.

, Pick up a little tank water with a clean cup and add it to the bag. Give it another 5-10 minutes to adjust, or up to 15 minutes to be extra safe. This will prevent the fish from dying due to a sudden and drastic pH change.

, You can either tip the majority of the water from the bag into another container and then let the fish swim from the bag into the tank or tip the bag at an angle, allowing the fish to swim out. Then dispose of the rest of the bag water elsewhere. Water from the bag may contain microorganisms or chemicals that damage your other fish.


If you don't feel comfortable adding any of the water from the bag into the tank, scoop up the fish with a small net and place it in the tank.

, Check on your new fish frequently, especially if it frantically avoids the other fish or seems too energetic. They should settle down eventually if you have enough (non-plastic) plants for them to hide in. If they do not, you may need to separate them temporarily with a tank divider.

Leave detailed instructions for others.",How to Feed Tropical Fish," Different kinds of fish like their food at different levels of the tank. Their mouths are designed to approach food in a certain way, so you’ll need to know their preferred way of feeding. Look at your fish’s mouth to determine where it likes to eat its food. Surface feeders have up-turned mouths for reaching up to the surface of the water. Hatchetfish and gouramies are common surface-feeders.These fish like having their food as flakes or floating pellets.
Mid-level feeders, like barbs and tetras, have forward-facing mouths, and will prefer food that sinks from the surface, but not necessarily reaches the floor of the tank. In addition, they may prefer tablets that can be stuck to the side of the tank, which lets them eat in full view of you and anyone you want to see your fish.
Bottom feeders have downward-facing mouths, and like to graze on food that sits at the bottom of the tank. Plecos and Cory Catfish are popular bottom feeders.If you have bottom feeders, make sure you get heavier pellets or other food that will sink to the bottom of the tank.;
, There are many different species of tropical fish, and while they can have specific diets in the wild, they will generally fit into three categories depending on the kind of food they eat. If you are unsure what kinds of fish you have, check with the pet store you bought them from, or a veterinarian.Carnivores. These fish like a large, protein rich diet. They will mostly likely have large mouths full of sharp teeth for tearing their food apart. If you have predator fish, just be careful about the other fish in your tank, as they may try to eat other, smaller fish.
Herbivores. These fish have smaller stomachs and flat teeth for grinding plant material. They will want plant and vegetable matter, and you’ll need to feed them in small amounts, and with more frequency.
Omnivores. This covers most aquarium fish, and they will eat a wide variety of food. Because of this variety, they are generally easier to take care of.

, While many fish have specific diets when they are out in the wild, most foods available in a pet store will provide your pets with the needed nutrients. While there are many specific brands and types of foods, they will generally all fit into several categories. Talk to the pet store about the best options for the fish you have.Dry foods. These are the most common types of foods, and can come in various forms including flakes, pellets, tablets, and sticks. If you use flakes, you’ll probably need to use quite a bit of them to make sure your fish get enough to eat. You can also get larger tablets that sink to the bottom of the tank for bottom feeders and scavengers.
Frozen foods. These are mixtures of food that can provide different nutrients, though you’ll need to vary them even more than with dry foods to make up for deficiencies. You can store frozen foods in your freezer, and just drop them into the tank. The tank’s warm water will thaw out the food for your fish. Avoid foods that have been thawed and refrozen.
Live foods. Some fish, especially predators, enjoy chasing down their food. Small worms and fleas are most common, though larger worms like earthworms and mealworms are popular with larger carnivores. You can also look for small creatures like brine shrimp and krill. Most pet stores do not stock large supplies of live foods, so you will need to get a separate supplier, or be prepared to raise your own.
You can also supplement your fishes’ diet with vegetables from around your home. Take a small piece of a carrot, potato, or cucumber, and set it on the bottom of the tank overnight for your fish to graze on. Just remember to remove whatever is left the next morning., The actual process of feeding your fish is pretty easy. Sprinkle the food into the tank, and watch your fish go at it. Your fish should finish their food in about 5 minutes. Anything longer than that would be overeating, or leave you with extra food to clean up.You can also feed your fish with an apparatus or accessory. There are automatic feeders which will release an amount of food at preset times. You can also get rings, tubes, and tongs that will help you keep control of food for easier clean up. Before you get a feeding tube or ring, make sure your fish will eat peacefully together, and not get into fights., Because fish are cold-blooded, their metabolism is tied to the water temperature in the tank. With your tank’s temperature kept around 74-78 degrees, it will take about 16-24 hours for your fish to fully digest their food.One feeding per day is enough to make sure they get the proper portion, and have time to digest it properly.


You can feed more than once a day. If you do that, though, it should be in smaller portions.
Avoid overfeeding. This is the most common mistake people make with In addition to leaving extra food to clean up, eating too much will cause your fish to become bloated. If your fish have been overfed, they will float to the top and swim upside down. In addition, they will probably produce more waste, making it harder to clean the tank., Once your fish are familiar with their environment, they may swim near the surface to beg for food. Don’t give in, no matter how cute you think it looks. Keep their feedings to once or twice per day. Remember, a hungry fish is a healthy fish.If your fish really are underfed, they will look emaciated, and fight one another more often during feedings., Once your fish have finished eating, remove all the excess food from the tank. Leftover food will likely not get eaten later. Instead, it will grow bacteria and dirty up your tank. Make sure you get rid of anything your fish don’t eat to keep the tank clean., Make sure you vary the types of food. Foods provide a variety of different nutrients, so more types of foods mean more nutrients. Also, different foods will help keep your fish from getting bored. If they are bored, they won’t eat as much, which of course isn’t very good.Even a once a week treat, like some brine shrimp in addition to flakes, can be a good way to diversify you fishes’ diet and help your fish stay healthy, strong, and colorful., Young fish, that is fish under three months old, should be fed more frequently, but in smaller meals. If your fish is less than a month old, you may need to feed it as many as six meals a day. You’ll have to watch them more carefully, but providing small portions for their stomachs to handle., If other people are going to be taking care of your fish, make sure they know exactly how you do the feeding. It may be easier to divide the food up for them in advance so all they need to do is put it in the tank and clean up afterward."

, Using a clear 8-12 ounce container, or fish bowl in the deluxe kit, fully submerge the miracle pouch in non-chlorinated, room temperature (64-86°F) water for at least 24 hours. Bottled water is preferred or if using tap water, place it in direct sunlight for at least 2 hours to remove all chlorine from the water; alternatively, a water conditioner from your local pet store can be used. Gently move the pouch around in the water after it has been submerged for 24 hours to encourage any My BFFs that are hiding in the pouch to come out. The miracle pouch can produce up to 8 fish. Allow a day or two to see how many My BFFs have hatched.

, Remove the 2 food cups from Box #2 and fill them with fresh, clean water (as described above). Remove the measuring spoon in your tool kit from Box #4 and pour 1 level spoon of ""non iodized"" salt into the cups. Remove the small bag of fish food from Box #4. Place a pinch of fish food into the cup of salt water and place the food cups in a warm area - up to 80 °F (27 °C).

, Remove the dropper from Box #4. Once the fish food is ready, you will see the brine shrimp swimming around in the food cup. Use the dropper to collect the brine shrimp from the food cup to feed My BFFs.

If you intend to keep the mother molly in with the fry, have multiple broods going into the same tank, or if you have a large brood, opt for a larger tank. Generally, for broods without their mother, a 10 gallon tank will be sufficient.If your fry are going to be live born, make sure you have the nursery tank ready before the mother gives birth.;
, Filtration is important in any tank, but especially for your fry. Set up a simple foam filter or other appropriate filtration for the size of your tank. If you do not use a foam or mesh covered filter, find an attachment or fitting from your local aquarium store to make the tank fry safe.You can also make your own filter modification by stretching a small strip of nylon over the filter and securing it with a rubber band.
It is imperative to make sure your filter is fry-safe. If it is not, it has the potential to suck up the fry.

, You may use artificial plants or live plants, but it is important to plant your tank before the fry arrive. This provides cover for the fry in their early days, and acts similar to a breeding trap.Look for a mixture of broad-leafed plants such as Java ferns as well as grasses.
Float some of the plants so that the newborns have an area near the surface to hide immediately after being born.

, Since mollies are tropical fish, they are going to need to be in water that approximates a tropical climate. Keep your water between 72 and 84 degrees Fahrenheit (23 to 28 C) using an aquarium heater.Estimate needing around 5 watts from your heater for every gallon of water in your aquarium. Talk with a specialist at your local aquarium store to get the right heater for your setup.
Use an aquarium thermometer to monitor the temperature of your tank and ensure it is consistent.

, If you truly cannot equip a breeding tank, a mesh breeding trap may be a reasonable alternative. You can buy one of these mesh boxes meant to protect small fish from your local aquarium store or pet shop. Hang it along the side of your regular aquarium.Rinse the mesh in warm, fresh water before hanging it in order to ensure it is as clean as possible for the fry.
Keep in mind that fry will quickly outgrow the mesh and may still need a larger tank separate from other adult fish before they are ready to be introduced into your larger aquarium.

, If your fry will come from a live bearer, move the mother before she gives birth. You will know when a female molly is preparing to give birth by watching the swell of her abdomen as well as by observing the spots near her anal fin, which will darken as the delivery date nears.Adults, especially males, may feed on newborn fry, so it is imperative to move the mother into the nursery tank before the fry are born.

, If you are getting your fry from a store, breeder, or another molly fish enthusiast, be prepared to pick them up quickly after birth. Make sure the fry are sealed in a plastic bag with warm water and room enough for the fry to move around.


Try to get your fry home as fast as possible. You want to minimize the amount of stress on your fry, so avoid taking long routes home or stopping while you still have the fry in transit.

, If you are getting your fry from elsewhere, set aside around 15 minutes to acclimate your fry. Allow the bag holding the fry to float in your nursery tank for at least 15 minutes in order to slowly bring the water temperature in the bag up to the temperature in the tank.Introducing your fry into your tank without acclimating them may shock their system and lead to some of the fry dying off.

, Once the set period has passed, introduce the fry to the tank by gently opening the plastic bag and allowing the fry to swim out. Do not dump the bag into the water, and do not squeeze the fry to get them out.


If you are using a breeding trap, you may want to hold the trap right at the surface of the water and gently allow the water to flow out of the plastic bag in order to prevent any fry from escaping into the larger aquarium.

, Observe the fry after they are introduced into the nursery aquarium. Make sure they are all moving and hiding. If any of the fry did not survive birth or the journey home, use a net to quickly remove them from the aquarium.


Observe the mother to make sure she is not acting aggressively toward the newly hatched fry, if they are in the same tank. If so, move the mother back into your regular aquarium.

, Right after the fry are born or are introduced into the tank, feed them. Your local aquarium shop might have food made especially for fry. Otherwise, you can use baby brine shrimp or a high quality flake food that is ground into a powder.Regular flake food may be too large for the fry to handle. Use a coffee grinder or a mortar and pestle to grind up your regular fish food into a powder that is more manageable for the fry.
Keep to a regular feeding schedule. Feed your fry small amounts of food, about a pinch at a time, several times a day. To make it easy, feed the fry immediately before or after you eat.
Clean any uneaten food from the tank. Use a net or a skimmer to get powdered food off of the surface of the water.

, Even with a filter, you want to change the water regularly to ensure the health of your fry. Try to use some water from your standard aquarium when you change out the fry’s water in order to acclimate them to their eventual home.Look to change about twenty percent of the tank’s water every day. That means that if you have a 10 gallon aquarium, you want to take two gallons a day out and replace them with two gallons of water from your regular aquarium.

, It will take around one to two months for your fry to grow large enough to be introduced into your standard aquarium. The fry should be larger than the mouths of an adult molly fish.Do not move the molly fry until you are sure they are ready to handle your larger tank. Moving the fry prematurely may cause tension between the fry and your other fish.

, Use a breeder trap to acclimate your fry a few at a time to your normal tank. Purchase a breeding trap if you do not have one already, and set it up on the side of the tank to which you want to move the fry.Clean or rinse the trap before setting it in your aquarium. This ensure the safety and health of your current fish, as well as the fry.

, Transfer the fry a few at a time to the breeding trap. If your two tanks are located next to one another, you may be able to do this using a standard aquarium net. If the tanks are further apart, you may want to place the fry in a large bowl or bucket filled with water from the nursery aquarium to carry them to their new tank.


Do not overcrowd the breeding trap. Make sure the fry have enough room to swim around comfortably while you transfer them. Do a few at a time so that you do not crowd the trap.

, Allow the fry to acclimate for around one hour in the breeding trap before releasing them into your aquarium. When you are ready to release them, submerge the trap well below the waterline of the aquarium, open it, and allow the fish to swim out.Observe the fry for a few minutes after letting them out of the trap. Make sure that the fry aren’t being antagonized or harmed by any of your other fish.

, Continue on with this process until all of your fry are in your aquarium. Allow each fry time to acclimate before letting them loose in your regular tank. Watch the fry carefully for the first couple days after they move tanks to ensure their health and safety.


If an individual fry seems to be struggling in your aquarium, you may consider moving it back to the nursery tank or into the breeding trap for a few days before retrying to acclimate it.

Make sure your peacock eels eat.",How to Keep Peacock Eels," Peacock eels need a decent amount of space in their tank to swim and for vegetation. They need a fairly large tank in order to thrive, so you may need to consider how many eels you want before choosing a tank.


Peacock eels do best in tanks that hold 35 gallons of water or more.A good rule of thumb is to have a tank large enough to have one gallon of water for each inch of full grown eel that will inhabit it.Choose a tank with a tight fitting lid to prevent your peacock eels from escaping.;
, Peacock eels are borrowers that spend much of their time buried in the substrate at the bottom of your tank, so make sure to give them plenty of material to burrow in.Use aquarium gravel or freshwater aquarium sand purchased from a pet store to make sure it is clean and parasite free.
If you use gravel, peacock eels prefer fine gravel for their burrowing.Add approximately four inches of substrate to the bottom of the tank to create the best possible environment for your peacock eels., Peacock eels are sensitive fresh water fish that require specific water quality. Taking care to ensure you have the water treated properly will go far in helping your peacock eels adapt to their new environments and remain healthy. Use water conditioner that removes chlorine and chloramine from the water in the tank.
Peacock eels are known as “brackish” fresh water eels, which means they are freshwater fish that prefer some salt content in their water. You should add up to one teaspoon of aquarium salt per gallon of water in the tank to keep your peacock eels happy and healthy.

, There are a few different options for water filters that are well suited for keeping peacock eels. If you are using a larger tank, placing the pump below the substrate may be a good option, otherwise you may want to use a filter that attaches to the side of your tank. A canister filter under the substrate can do a good job of keeping the oxygen content of the water higher, but can be an issue for your borrowing eels.
Filters that affix to the side of the tank and have outflow right at the surface of the water are usually safer for this breed of fish.
Choose a filter that provides a water turnover of ten to fifteen times per hour.

, Peacock eels are more active in dimly lit aquariums so adding vegetation can make them more comfortable and give you more opportunities to see them in action.


Floating plants are great for peacock eels.
Aquarium safe caves and castles are good for peacock eels to play and hide in.
Driftwood roots and potted plants are also great for them to hide in and around., Although the water filter in the tank will help keep the tank clean, peacock eels can be very sensitive to water quality. Peacock eels may require more water maintenance that some other breeds of tropical fish. Replace approximately 30% of the water in the tank each week.
Peacock eels prefer very clear and clean water, so if your water become foggy change it out and consider adjusting your filtration method.

, Once you are sure your peacock eels are healthy and adjusting to your aquarium you can reduce feeding to multiple times per week, but feed them frequently until then. Peacock eels need live food to survive. Bloodworms, black worms and tubifex are excellent food sources and can be bought at most pet stores.
The worms you feed your peacock eel can burrow into the substrate and establish their own colonies so your eel will have plenty to eat.
Over time, peacock eels can even learn to eat right from your hand!

, Peacock eels don’t usually require tank heaters to adjust the temperatures of the water. Many people who live in warmer climates will find their tanks don’t require any kind of heater. Peacock eels prefer temperatures above 72 degrees Fahrenheit, so if your house stays warmer than that on average you probably won’t need a tank heater.
Never let the water in your tank exceed 80 degrees.

, Peacock eels tend to become very shy when introduced to new environments. They will hide most of the time when first brought into a new home, but with the right variables in place they can become happy members of your aquarium’s community.Over time, peacock eels can become extremely friendly fish.
If you set your tank up to make the peacock eels feel safe, they will begin emerging from their hiding places sooner.

, Peacock eels can be good community fish, but sharing the tank can cause some complications in your care of the peacock eels and their companions.


Make sure any fish you choose prefer similar water temperatures and conditions to that of the peacock eel. Peacock eels can be more sensitive to changes in their environments than some other fish.
Peacock eels will eat smaller fish, so it’s best to keep them with fish that are larger than they are., Peacock eels can be aggressive toward smaller fish but don’t do well among fish that are much more aggressive than they are. They can be great tank mates provided they share their home with the right kinds of fish. Peacock eels get along well with other fish of the same breed as long as they are of similar size.
Peacock eels can get along well with peaceful fish, but you should monitor their interactions to ensure your peacock eels don’t hurt the less aggressive fish.
Peacock eels and their tank mates are safest when they are all “semi-aggressive” fish.
Examples of fish that are safe with peacock eels are swordtails, rainbow fish, and ottocinclus cats.

, Peacock eels are easily bullied away from food by faster or more aggressive fish. You may need to take special precautions to ensure your peacock eels don’t end up going hungry as a result of their tank mates.Try feeding your peacock eels in the evening when other fish are less active.
Make sure to watch your peacock eels eat to ensure their food isn’t taken by more aggressive fish.

Since weather loaches, and especially all other loaches are scavengers it would be best to feed them, sinking algae wafers or, bloodworms, or brine shrimp.

,
Make sure you acclimate them.",How to Keep Japanese Weather Loaches," Weather loaches (Dojo Loaches) aren't an ordinary loach. They present themselves as an eel like fish that has a slender body, and either have a pink, or brown spotted variant, and can reach up to 8"" inches in length and need to be kept in an aquarium at least 40–55 gallons (151.4–208.2 L). They also can be simple to keep as long as, proper needs are met.;
, Dojo loaches aren't aggressive at all however, tankmates should be chosen wisely. Since they're coldwater fish they are able to be kept with goldfish as long as there is a proper tank size for the two. They also are very social fish, so it would be a great idea to keep them in a shoal of 3-6.

, Weather loaches aren't the type to hide behind tall plants. What they do prefer is smaller caves or pieces of PVC pipes. Also, if you are keeping plastic plants in the aquarium, make sure they're silk plants, due to the more rough plastic plants damaging their fins.

,, Like all other aquatic animals the weather loach should be acclimated in a fully cycled aquarium. The process of acclimation should last from 15-30 minutes. Once that time has past then, gently net the loach out from the bag and release it from the aquarium without dripping the water into the tank.

Take notes about the ones that seem particularly interesting to you. Do you like the bright color of goldfish or perhaps the unique shape of puffers? You can also ask the store clerk for assistance, but it is always best to go in with some prior knowledge.


Joining a fish forum online is another good option. You can ask the members any questions and read through past posts. For example, they may be able to tell you that not all goldfish are the same. The rep cap oranda goldfish is a great starter fish, but requires a tank of at least 30 gallons.;
, Freshwater fish are generally considered to be more ‘beginner friendly’ than their saltwater counterparts. However, there are still differing levels of care. Ask yourself, how much time do I have to care for a fish? How much money do I have to spend on equipment? If you are limited in resources and time, a low-maintenance fish may be good for you.


A fahaka puffer is an example of an expert-level fish. They are difficult to keep alive in captivity and require very large tanks well-stocked with plant life. In contrast, a standard beta is a carnivore that can live in a small bowl on a pretty straightforward diet of dried food., “Species tanks” or tanks with just one fish are nice, but if you want to add in other types, you will want to do some thinking beforehand. Consider the temperaments of the fish as well as their life requirements. Do not pair peaceful fish with aggressive ones. Make sure that all fish in your tank need roughly the same temperature and pH levels.

, Match your tank dimensions to the final size of your full grown fish. Calculate the surface area of your tank by multiplying the length times the width (in inches) and dividing by 12. This will tell you the number of fish of that your tank can sustain.


Coldwater fish require more room than their tropical counterparts. For coldwater, follow the same formula but divide by 30 instead of 12.Overcrowding is a serious issue as it can contribute to toxic ammonia levels, overtaxed filtration systems, injured or sick fish, and an overall dirty tank.

, You can buy fish online, direct from a breeder, at a pet store, or at an aquarium store. Choose a company that has positive reviews and is well-established. Look for clean tanks with numerous fish options. Select fish that appear healthy and vibrant, swimming and inspecting their environment. Stick to your plans and don’t overbuy to avoid overcrowding.Handle the fish bag carefully on the way home. Don’t jostle or shake it or you will agitate the fish.

, Place your tank in an area without consistent direct sunlight, to prevent the growth of algae. You need a flat, level surface with access to a reliable electrical outlet. The area will also need to support the weight of the tank. You can estimate 10-12 pounds per gallon with gravel added.


Keep the tank away from your home’s AC or heater unit as it will cause the temperature to fluctuate dangerously.

, Most people like to include gravel as it increases visual appeal and helps to trap debris at the ground level. Estimate 1.5-2 pounds of gravel for every gallon of water in your tank. Rinse your gravel well before placing it in the bottom of your tank. Try to make it fairly level, although you can create a rise in the front of the tank, if desired.Be aware that not all fish do well with gravel. It can be dangerous to some as they will mistake it for food and try to eat it.
You can also add in plants (live or plastic) and other décor. Just note that everything that you put in the tank needs to be rinsed beforehand and will require regular cleaning afterwards. If you are looking to invest minimal time, limit your add-ons.

, A heater is used to keep your aquarium temperature at a certain level. An aquarium light allows you to see clearly into the tank and is a requirement if you have live plants. There are many different heater options including those that hang off the side of the tank, submerge in the water, or generate heat under the tank gravel via a coil.


An aquarium hood with a light and heater combo is often a good idea as it protects your fish from airborne particles and keeps them in the tank. Whatever lighting setup you choose, just remember to limit its operation to 7-10 hours a day to prevent the growth of algae. Most lights come with timers.Not all fish require the use of heater. Some cold water species, such as goldfish, are fine without one. Tropical fish, on the other hand, generally require a temperature between 75 and 80 degrees.Aquarium plants often do the best with a coil heater as it keeps the gravel (i.e. soil) at a steady, warm temperature. Healthy plant life also means healthy, happy fish.

, A filter is a tank necessity as it removes debris from the water, keeping it safe for your fish. You have three options: biological, mechanical, chemical, or a combination. Some filters even include built-in heaters to process and release cleaned, heated water back into the tank.


Biological filters use bio matter (microorganisms, etc.) to digest and remove contaminants. There are canister filters with bio matter contained inside. Or, even natural sponges that float in the water with bio matter growing on them.
Mechanical filtration involves water flowing through a device that captures debris and holds it.
Chemical filtration uses activated carbon to extract toxins from the water. The carbon is usually contained in a canister container, often being both a mechanical and chemical filter in one.

, Use room temperature water and fill up the tank. Don’t pour the water in directly. Instead, use your hand or a plate to deflect it to the side of the tank then down, keeping your gravel intact. Add a few drops of water conditioner, or specifically a dechlorinator, to neutralize chemicals found in tap water that are dangerous to fish.To complete the cycle, you need to let the tank sit for at least 24 hours.

, Float the plastic bag containing the fish (or other container) in the tank for at least 15 minutes. Then, at 3 5-minute intervals allow a little tank water to seep into the bag. After this process is done, net the fish one-by-one and place them in the aquarium.You do not need to add the bag water into the aquarium. You can dispose of it.
The goal is to create a controlled, relaxed transport in order to minimize trauma to the fish.

, Overfeeding is a common mistake as fish don’t know how to stop eating. You need to feed your fish twice daily, so pick two times that work for you and stick to them. Only feed your fish what they can consume in a minute or two. Use a net to remove all extra food from the water’s surface.Control the amount given by dropping in “pinches” of food at a time. Go slowly.
Fish food is sold in pellet form, flake form, or freeze dried. Feeding a fish other live fish can lead to disease transmission. You can also purchase bloodworms or brine shrimp to supplement your fish’s diet.If you are out of town you can set up a feeding block or automatic feeder.
Some people also choose to use a feed/fast schedule. They do not feed their fish for one day out of the week. This is not harmful and can lead to a cleaner tank., Use your gravel siphon to remove between 25-50% of the water (depending on your tank and fish species) out of the tank and into a clean bucket. As you siphon, try to remove as much debris around the gravel as you can. Remove and scrub any plants or decorations. Remove algae from the glass using your siphon and an algae pad. Fill another bucket with tap water, add water conditioner, and let it sit for a few minutes. Refill the tank with the treated water.You will want to unplug your filter and remove and rinse your filter pads. Use the water removed from the tank for rinsing as direct tap water will kill all the good bacteria.
Make sure to unplug your heater or keep it lowered into the tank water during this process.Wipe down the outside of the tank with a paper towel or cotton rag after you are finished.

, Get a stick-on thermometer and place it on the outside of the tank. Monitor the temperature on a daily basis, just by taking a quick glance. You should generally keep the tank between 76 to 80 degrees. If the temperature is off, you may need to think about changing your heater or the location of the tank., You can purchase a simple kit at most pet and aquarium stores. It will contain testing supplies for ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, alkalinity, and water hardness. It will also contain information about the safe limits of these various elements. A kit will take of the guess work away from maintaining your water.Ammonia is particularly toxic and dangerous as it originates from the feces of fish. It can cause stress and death. Another reason to monitor and maintain a functioning filtration system., Go to the few pet store to stock up on extra supplies (filters, etc.) just in case. If you notice cloudy water, for example, you want to test the water right away. Keep an eye out for other visual signs of trouble, such as dead fish or frayed fish. You may need to isolate sick fish and dead fish need to be removed."

Catch a pet crappie.,
Get a relatively large aquarium.,
Pour gravel into the tank until it is about two inches thick.,
Have many hiding places in your aquarium for the crappie.,
Get an aquarium hood.,
Use lighting to crappie daytime and nighttime.

,
Understand that Crappie do not require heating.,
Obtain a powerful filter.,
Obtain treated water.,
Cycle your tank.,
Give your crappie a diet of only live food.,
Clean the aquarium once a week.

",How to Keep Crappie in an Aquarium," Crappie are not sold in pet stores. You can catch them with a net or a fishing pole. The small hole in their mouth from the hook will heal quickly and won't get infected if the water in your aquarium is clean. To learn how to catch crappie with a fishing pole, search the Internet.;
, In the wild, crappie live in large lakes and ponds. For small crappie, a twenty gallon tank will be fine. For large, adult crappie, a fifty gallon tank or more is a better choice.

, Natural colored gravel will help your aquarium imitate the crappie's natural habitat. Make sure it is cleaned to remove dust.

, Crappie like to hide and wait for prey to swim by, then they ambush. Crappie have very tough scales and fins, so fake plastic plants won't harm them.

, Crappie aren't jumpers, but an aquarium hood would help ensure the safety of the fish.

,, In the wild, they're lake or pond can fluctuate from freezing to very warm.

, Crappie are dirty fish. They give off a lot of waste. A powerful filter is essential to your fish's survival. Try to find one that doesn't make a lot of current. In the wild, the lakes and ponds crappie live in are usually stagnant.

, Crappie are very sensitive to chlorine.

, Wild crappie live in lakes or ponds with plenty of helpful bacteria. You need to simulate that to help keep them from being overly stressed. Let your tank cycle for a month or so before adding the crappie.

, They will not eat fish flakes, pellets, or bloodworms. In the wild, they eat a bait fish called shad and wild minnows.


Usually, gas stations and stores near lakes will sell live minnows for fishing bait. If you don't live close to one of these gas stations or stores, you can buy small goldfish to feed them.

They will quickly adapt from shad and minnows and happily prey on goldfish. You can keep minnows or goldfish in a separate aquarium, and take one or two out and feed them to your crappie when it's time for him to feed, or you can keep them in the same tank. Feed the minnows or goldfish.


You may be keeping them just to be eaten, but you shouldn't let them starve. Feed goldfish flakes, and feed minnows freeze-dried bloodworms.

Know your fish.,
Keep tiger barbs in the proper size aquarium.,
Get a heater.,
Add some decorations.,
Choose tank mates wisely!,
Choose the right diet.,
Acclimate the tiger barbs to the aquarium.",How to Keep Tiger Barbs," For a visual thought of the tiger barb, they grow to at least three inches in length, with three noticeable stripes running down their body. The average life expectancy of tiger barbs is at least 4-6 years.;
, A 20 gallon aquarium (75 Liters) is the very bare minimum for six tiger barbs (the larger the aquarium the better.) Also do be aware! You should not keep tiger barbs in a group less than six. They are aggressive fish which if kept in a smaller group or smaller aquarium size then, they will become a lot more aggressive to tank mates.

, Since tiger barbs are tropical fish they should be kept in an aquarium at least 70*F-78*F. Also for them to successfully live they should be kept in a fully cycled aquarium (as well as all aquatic life).

, When keeping tiger barbs it is always good to keep the aquarium decorated. Keeping the aquarium well planted or decorated will reduce shyness and create good hiding spots for your fish.

, Tiger barbs are quite aggressive fish and are very notorious fin nippers!


Fish like bottom dwellers or larger fish without longer fins are likely to be successful in the same aquarium as tiger barbs. Larger fish such as: Bala sharks, Parrot cichlids, etc.
Fish that are not likely to be successful are: Longer fin Danio, Angelfish, Betta fish, Veiled fish, and larger fish likely to eat it.

, Feeding your tiger barbs a mixed diet is always the healthiest option! Tropical flakes, brine shrimp, and blood-worms are good examples of what to feed our tiger barbs.

, Acclimation is a process (which all fish or crustacean) need to go through. What acclimation does is for that specific aquatic animal to adapt to the aquarium water parameters.


Acclimate the barbs for at least 15-30 minutes for each fish to adjust to the parameters.
Once acclimation has been complete, then remove the barbs gently from the bag (without the water from the bag dripping into the aquarium too much) with the net into the aquarium.

Be on the lookout for pregnant fish.,
Ensure your tank is large enough.,
Consider a separate tank.,
Purchase plants and/or a breeding trap.,
Separate the mother from the community tank and wait.,
Return the mother to the community tank.,
Feed the fry.,
Keep their tank clean.,
Introduce new fish into the community tank.",How to Take Care of Baby Platy Fish," Pregnant platies are easy to spot, so if you keep a close eye on your fish, they shouldn't be a surprise. A pregnant platy will develop a noticeably swollen belly.It's also common for a pregnant female to develop a dark spot near her back fin. This is caused by the eyes of the unborn fry pressing against her scales.;
, For a few adult platies, a 10 gallon tank is usually sufficient. However, if you plan for your platies to breed and you want to keep the fry, a much larger tank will be necessary.


A minimum tank size of 29 gallons is recommended if you plan on letting your fish reproduce not letting them eat their fry., Because platies do eat their young, you will end up with the greatest number of surviving fry if you purchase a separate tank for them to live in while they grow.A separate aquarium for your fry can be purchased at most pet stores.

, To survive, whether in a community tank or in a separate tank with only their mother, your fry will need hiding places to escape to. This purpose can be served by either a lot of plants or a breeding trap.Plastic plants can be used, but live plants can often be a source of extra nutrition for your fish, who may take small bites of them to supplement their diets.There are many types of live plants that platies enjoy, which should be available at your local pet store. Good choices include bunch plants, such as anacharis and cabomba, floating plants like hornwort and water sprite, and mosses such as java moss.Many (but probably not all) of your platy fry will survive in a community tank if it contains enough plants for them to hide in.A breeding trap is a plastic box with small holes that goes inside a fish tank. The mother is placed inside the breeding trap, and when the fry are born, they can escape through the small holes to avoid being eaten. The mother will not be able to follow them., If you've opted for a separate tank to keep the fry isolated from the adult fish, separate the mother as soon as you can after you've noticed she's pregnant.You generally have between 24 and 30 days to make accommodations for your new fry once the mother shows signs of pregnancy.Once the mother gives birth, you can expect to have 20-40 new fry on average. Sometimes, this number can climb as high as 80., After the mother fish gives birth, you can return her to the community tank (assuming you separated her). The fry will now be free to develop without threat of being eaten.

, Baby platy fish do not require different food from adults. You can feed them the same pellets or flakes that you feed the adults, as well as freeze-dried bloodworms and tubifex, and brine shrimp.Feed the fish small amounts several times a day, about as much food as they can eat in three minutes.Some platy owners like to crush or grind pelleted or flaked food before feeding it to fry, as this will make it easier for them to eat.For platy fish to develop the brilliant colors that make them so beautiful, they must be fed a varied diet early in life, containing both protein and plant-based foods.Specially formulated food is commercially available for platy fry, but is not necessary., Just as with your adult platies, you'll need to keep the tank for the fry clean.


Changing 25 percent of the water every two to four weeks is typically adequate, but this depends on the number of fish.If the water becomes cloudy or full of debris, it should be changed more often.

, Once they have grown large enough to fend for themselves, you can move the young fish to the community tank with the older fish.


Platy reach full size after about four months.If you decide to try to introduce them to the community tank sooner than that, keep an eye on them to make sure they aren't being eaten by the adults.

Be careful not to hurt the fish.,
Bring in some fish friends.",How to Take Care of Botia Fish," Loaches, having almost no scales, tend to acquire illnesses easily. There are two primary diseases that afflict botia.The first is known as ich (short for ichthyophthirius), a disease caused by a parasite that results in small white speckles across the surface of the fish.
The second illness is known as skinny disease. Like ich, it is also caused by a parasite, and (as the name implies) results in your fish losing weight even when it is eating a normal diet.
If you notice one or more of your botia are ill, remove them to a quarantine tank (a smaller backup tank with water of the same quality as that in your main tank) and do not introduce new fish to the tank until the illness has been cured.;
, Unfortunately, botia health is so delicate that many medications that work fine for other species cause adverse side effects in botia.Consult with a veterinarian familiar with botia in order to treat your fish should they be afflicted by ich, skinny disease, or any other illness.


If you notice your botia becoming lethargic, clamping its fins, rubbing against the side of the tank or against inanimate objects, or floating vertically for periods of time, it needs medical attention. These behaviors are abnormal and could be caused by any number of illnesses that a vet is best qualified to diagnose.
Locate a fish specialist in your area using the American Association of Fish Veterinarians database at http://www.fishvets.org/tools/locator/locator.asp?id=30.

, Botia like to eat both frozen and dried food. Feed your botia a variety of foods at first and observe their behavior. Feed them primarily the foods they like the most, but maintain some variety in their diet. Feed your botia three times each day with the lights dimmed or out.


To feet your fish, dump an appropriate amount of food in the water. The amount you need depends on how many fish you have in your tank. The back of most commercially available fish foods should have directions for use.
If you notice uneaten food collecting on the bottom of the tank or floating near the top, this is a sign you’re over-feeding your fish. Scale back the amount of feed slightly until your fish consume everything you give them.
You could feed your fish frozen foods like daphnia, brineshrimp, krill, or mysis.
You could also feed them dried foods like sinking carnivore pellets, sinking catfish pellets, and algae wafers.
Larger botia might enjoy salad shrimp.
Botia also enjoy human snacks like cucumber and zucchini in small slices.
Younger botia are less picky about what they eat than older botia., When introducing new fish -- whether new botia or new dither fish -- ensure you purchase them from a reputable dealer. They should be at least two inches long. Fish smaller than two inches will require intensive feeding and will generally only cause headaches for you.Keep new fish in a quarantine tank for at least two weeks prior to introducing them to the main tank.Do not buy fish that seem lethargic or fish that have clamped fins (fins that are laying flat against the fish’s body).
Botia are virtually scaleless and are therefore more susceptible to illnesses than other fish.

, Ensure your tank has a firmly-closed cover or mesh screen to ensure the fish cannot jump out but can still get fresh air circulating within the tank.Your tank should hold at least 30 gallons (110 L).A tank of this size is appropriate for about five five-inch botia fish. Of course, if you have space and money for a larger tank, your botia would surely appreciate it.

, Botia fish prefer water that is soft and slightly acidic (approximately 6.5-8 on the pH scale).Their water should be clean, well-oxygenated, and low in nitrates. Ensure your tank has a pump to keep oxygen flowing into the tank, and a filter to keep yucky bits out. Include a thermometer in the tank so you can see what temperature the water is, and try to keep it between 75 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit (23.5 and 28 degrees Celsius).If you have trouble with the temperature, install an under-tank heater to boost the temperature, or a get an aquarium cooler to reduce the temperature.
Use water that is distilled and dechlorinated.
Check the specific needs for your particular species of botia when setting tank conditions.

, In order to change the water, carefully remove your fish to a quarantine tank.


Remove 30% of the water in the main tank.You can use a measuring cup or a siphon.
For instance, if your tank has 20 gallons (75.7 L) in it, you should remove six gallons of water.
Add new water to the tank equal in amount to the water you removed from the tank.
For instance, using the prior example, you would add six gallons of clean, fresh water of an appropriate pH, temperature, and hardness to the tank.
Cycle the water for about 20 minutes with the pump, then replace the botia from the quarantine tank back into their main tank.
In addition to weekly cleanings, change the tank water when you notice it is visibly dirty or has a lot of detritus floating on top or at the bottom.

, There are several choices for substrate. You could add fine, smooth aquatic gravel, or aquarium sand.Aquarium sand is a more natural choice compared to gravel. It is also cleaner than gravel, since gravel has large gaps between it where grime and yucky bits can accumulate.Do not keep your fish on any substrate that is sharp or jagged. Since botia fish are bottom-dwellers, they will spend a lot of time in close proximity to the substrate, and can wear down their barbells quickly on sharp substrate. It might also lead to infected barbells.
Keep the substrate clean by using an aquarium vacuum on the bottom of the tank during weekly water changes. This will collect uneaten food bits and waste from the tank.

, While it is a good idea to include either natural or artificial aquarium rocks just as you would with any fish, be careful to ensure any rocks you include are not rough or sharp. Lava rock, for instance, should be excluded from botia fish aquariums.


Additionally, avoid introducing rocks or features with very deep, narrow cracks. Botia fish like to wiggle their way into very narrow cracks where they might get stuck. Use a silicone adhesive to close openings and fill small cracks in aquarium features.
Elements that are easy and safe to incorporate into your botia fish tank include bogwood and slate.
While it is important that no very narrow cracks exist, you must still include some areas where the fish can hide. Botia fish get stressed if they feel they cannot conceal themselves or if they feel threatened. A small fish house or hollowed-out log are good choices.
Don’t bother adding plants. Botia will eat them., If you have overhead or internal aquarium lights, they might stress your new fish. Keep the lights off for the first three or four hours to avoid stressing your new botia.Botia are most active in the dark. Keep the lighting levels low most of the time, even when you’re nearby, to avoid upsetting them.

, Let the botia bag float on top of the aquarium water. After five minutes, take the bag out, and slowly pour out about half the water. Place one open corner of the bag into the tank and fill it up with water from the tank. Leave the bag with mixed water in for 20-25 minutes. Finally, open the bag and let the botia join the rest of the tank fish.

, Beneath their eyes, botia have tiny spikes known as suborbital spines. These spines are released in self-defense when they feel threatened or stressed, including when they are scooped out of one tank and into another. When transferring your botia from its bag or tank into its new home for the first time (or any time) be sure not to entangle the suborbital spines with the netting., To most closely approximate the natural environment of the botia fish, you must keep them in multiples. A population of five botia fish is the minimum you should maintain.If you keep your botia fish by itself, it might become aggressive or reclusive, and could starve itself to death.
In addition to others of their kind, botia like to see “dither fish” -- fish of other species that show the botia the waters are safe to swim in. Danios, rasboras, tetras, and barbs make excellent dither fish.

Decide if a puffer fish fits in your lifestyle.,
Decide on a puffer fish.,
Purchase a suitable tank.,
Set up your tank.,
Put your puffer fish in the tank.,
Feed your puffers.,
Monitor and examine your puffers during feeding times or when you are around them.",How to Purchase and Care for a Puffer Fish," You will be required to remain with it often, as it requires feeding once a day, and possibly more if it is kept around other fish. This means that if you were to go on a holiday, you would need to find a person to care for your pet. Understand that it may also be an expensive pet, which means that you may need to adjust your budget.;
, They range from minuscule dwarf puffers at roughly 1"" up to 6"" or more. Take note that a bigger puffer requires a bigger tank, so, just like other fish, it is necessary to find a puffer that's appropriate for your tank. Puffers range from semi-aggressive fish to no tank-mates at all. With the only exception being the Amazon puffer(which needs other Amazon puffers), puffer fish don't require any tank-mates. If you do decide that you want to keep your puffer with other fish, you must research the puffer fish you want to see what(if any) other fish can live with it.

, Puffers are very territorial creatures, so they need plenty of hiding spots. Purchase ornaments, such as rocks and caves, for them to hide in. Take note that if your puffer is freshwater, you need a tropical set up. A brackish (semi-salt) puffer requires a brackish set up while a marine (saltwater) puffer requires a marine habitat. Check with your local pet shop to see what type of tank you need for each species of puffer.

, Instructions should come with it. Most puffers need a temperature of around 79 Fahrenheit (26 Celsius). Add biological enhancer to allow good bacteria to colonize the substrate and the glass. Put in water cleanser to make tap water safe for the puffers (check with your local pet shop). Leave the tank alone for a week before providing the pet shop with a take water sample. Allow them to test it to see if your water levels (pH, ammonia, nitrites and nitrates) are correct and safe. If all nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia are at a safe level, then you can purchase your puffers.

, Let them rest in the bag floating in the water so the temperature equalizes with that of the bag. After twenty minutes, release them into their new home. In the first week, watch for fighting among puffers (if you have multiple including other fish). If the fish start to fight, you may need to purchase another replacement puffer.

, In order to keep them in good health, feed them two to three times a day with mini-bloodworms (give them one block of frozen mini-bloodworms per day in total for figure of eight puffers). If they don't finish the food, then you are overfeeding them. Also, do water changes once a week to keep on top of ammonia, nitrates and nitrites. To do this, take out roughly 20% of the tank water (the more water changed the better but don't go beyond 40%). Replace it with tap water cleansed by the water cleanser. Equally throw in a cockle each week to grind down the puffers' teeth. If they get too long, you will need to see a vet.

, If you notice any signs of harm or unusual behavior, speak to your local pet shop until you learn how to react to certain behavior changes or damage the puffers may have. It could be your ornaments, water conditions, other fish, or diseases causing the problem. However, some unusual behavior is common and there may be nothing wrong.

You can also add an aeration device to the tank by submerging an airstone in the back of the tank or where ever you prefer.,
Exercise caution and prudence when getting plants.,
Enhance the tank with lighting.,
Get some nice flat rocks.,
Be prepared with a variety of food.,
After you set up your tank, add your water slowly to not mess up the tank arrangement.

Plan on running your tank and filter without fish for at least 3 weeks.,
Getting the fish.,
When adding your fish to the tank, put your fish and some water into a Ziploc bag, close it and let it set in the water for 15 minutes or so.,
Give them a day or two to adjust to the tank before you start feeding them.,
When you start feeding, add small amounts of flakes.",How to Keep Bass and Other American Gamefish in Your Home Aquarium," Bass and other game fish can grow quite large, and may need hundreds of gallons. These are not guppies; keep in mind the adult size of the fish you plan on getting. They may need specialized care and food. Also, some wild-caught species of fish may be illegal to keep as pets in your area.;
, Depending on what type of fish you plan to include, acquiring a tank is the first step. Smaller fish, such as bluegill, will use a smaller tank than a bass, which can grow very large and need a very large tank. As a general rule, one 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) long per 10 gallons (37.9 L) of water. Bigger will always be better., A heavy duty filter will be needed as these fish produce large amounts of waste and are used to clean environments. Don't skimp on the filtration device. Shop around for a filter that has easy replacement filters. You will be changing them often!


Depending on the bottom substrate you choose will determine if you need an undergravel filter and powerhead. In some tanks, you might not use an undergravel filter because there is sand from the lake where you got the fish. If you choose large diameter aquarium gravel, then adding an underground filter would be appropriate. It does help keep the debris levels down. You will also need a powerhead to pull the water through the underground filter.
Bottom substrate should be as natural looking as possible. This is essentially a tank that displays a lake or pond in your home. Try to avoid bright colors for the bottom. It also takes away from the beautiful colors of the native fish. Aquarium sand mimics the natural lake bottom and really looks nice. Otherwise, a natural looking aquarium rock will work wonderful. Plan for two to three inches of rock on the bottom.

, You might find the fish playing in it once in a while.

, Plants can be a nice addition to a tank, but these fish may destroy live plants. Plastic plants or silk plants can look very nice. There are many varieties to choose from and there are even lily pads available. If you plan on mixing the types of fish, having many plants in the tank can help create safe havens for the smaller fish.

, Lighting can really enhance your tank. Find a full spectrum bulb that mimics natural sunlight. You will see a color explosion in your fish with quality lighting.

, Another addition to your tank could be an area of the tank with flat pieces of rocks arranged in a way that mimics a rocky area of the lake or pond. Certain fish, like rock bass, for example, need these additions.

, The type of food these fish need will require a variety of choices.


Once your fish realize that flakes and pellets are food (this can take a while), these can become staples.
Get a quality flake food, brine shrimp pellets, and bloodworms. There are some color enhancing foods out there that many fish seem to enjoy and help bring out their colors.
Brine shrimp squares can be crumbled up to make it easier for the fish to eat.
Expect to be adding live food to your fish's diet.
Crickets are greatly appreciated and is quite exciting to watch.
Cutting up pieces of earthworms into quarter inch pieces is another option.

,, This allows beneficial bacteria to colonize. You will need to add in an ammonia source regularly during this time either via a pure ammonia source or adding in fish food or even a frozen shrimp. Not all tap water is created equal. These fish are relatively 'tough' but it would be wise to test the water regularly during this time with commercially available test kits and adjust the ammonia source (i.e. adding in another shrimp or more ammonia) accordingly. Your tank will be ready for fish once ammonia and nitrite read 0 and nitrate are manageable at around 20.


Take some time on this and educate yourself properly on water quality testing by reading and asking knowledgeable fish people and remember this article is meant to be simply an overview.

, It is highly advisable to add only young fish to the tank. Older fish will have a much harder time adjusting to tank life. They will be much stressed out and be very picky about food. Younger fish are more adaptable to tank life. Starting off with easier fish, like bluegill, or rock bass will give you a chance to learn and can be a stepping stone to more varieties. Catching them with hook and line is not advisable for two reasons. One it stresses them out and can cause injury that must heal in your care. Second, if you can catch them on hook and line, they are most likely too big. You can catch them with a minnow trap that can be purchased at any tackle supply company. It's basically a funnel on both ends that the fish swim into and are unable to exit. You can fill it with dry cat food or cereal and set it out in the lake or pond by a dock, or where you find bluegill. (Check your state's guidelines for trapping fish. You may need to have a label on your trap with your name and address and fishing license number.) The openings are small so you will only be catching the young ones. Let the trap sit for a day or two and check it. Have a bucket with a lid (ice cream buckets work well) for your new fish. You might be surprised what you catch! Just keep what your tank can hold or less. You can always add more later.

, Add a little bit of the tank water to the Ziploc bag to help the fish adjust to the new water. Add a little more 20-30 minutes later. If the fish are looking good, pour them into the tank.

, Try to keep the area stress free... keep kids from tapping the tank, etc.

, Watch to see if they respond. If after a few days of trying flakes, try adding live or formally live items like small crickets, cut earthworms or brine shrimp. This could be the hardest part of keeping these fish. Watch them carefully and take notes on what they eat. Once they realize what is food they will seemingly eat all the time. Keep to a schedule. They will start to recognize your presence and come to the surface for food. You can eventually start hand feeding them crickets and earthworms.

Get a tight-fitting lid.",How to Keep a Bala Shark1," Since bala sharks can grow to 12 inches (30.5 cm) in captivity, they will need a fairly large tank. If you get them as juveniles, they will be fairly small at around 3 inches (7.6 cm)At this size they can do do well in a tank holding a minimum of 30 gallons (114 liters) and of a length of 30 inches (76.2 cm). But as they grow, they will need a minimum of 150 gallons (568 liters) and a tank length of at least 72 inches (182.9 cm)., Bala sharks are considered shoaling or schooling fish, which means they live in groups. So you’ll need to buy a group of between four and six fish to ensure that they’ll get along well with each other and stay in good health.A lone bala shark tends to become aggressive with other fish. And if kept in pairs, the dominant one is known to bully the other., Being larger fish, bala sharks need plenty of tank space for swimming, so don’t overcrowd them. A few plants around the perimeter of the tank, and some wood for shelter and decor, should be plenty. Provide a bed of rocks that is darker in color--this will allow the fishes’ silvery color to stand out better, and also helps them to feel secure., Since these fish come from a tropical environment, and will be living in a large tank, they’ll need a good heater to keep the large amount of water at the right temperature. An appropriate temperature range is 72 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (22.2 to 26.7 degrees Celsius)., Fill the tank with fresh water from the tap, and test its pH and hardness levels. Appropriate ranges are 6.5 to 7.8 for pH, and a water hardness of 2 to 10 dGH.Ask a tank specialist at the pet store about available gauges for monitoring these levels.


If you live in an area that takes its water from wells in limestone bedrock, the tap water will tend to be on the harder side. If the water comes from lakes, it will usually be softer.
While you can buy chemicals to adjust pH, you can also use peat in the tank or filter to raise acidity, and calcium salts to raise alkalinity., Since bala sharks are river fish, they are adapted to aquatic environments with steadily moving water. Buy a filter for your tank that is powerful enough to keep a steadily moving current running and provide enough oxygen for the fish.


A large canister filter can take care of oxygen, current, and water purity. A powerhead can help increase the current in larger tanks., Bala sharks are known to be peaceful and rarely aggressive. But their fast swimming and skittishness can cause stress for calmer species. They get along well with fish that have similar personalities,such as larger cichlids, angelfish, parrot cichlids, medium-size tetra, gouramis, and ram cichlids.


Try to keep bala sharks with other species at least half their size. They tend to see any fish small enough to fit in their mouths, such as smaller tetra, as food., When they are startled, bala sharks react by quickly moving away from what scares them, or jumping. They are known to leap as high as six feet out of an open tank. So be sure to outfit your tank with a tight-fitting lid."
"
Acclimate them carefully.,
Expect an adjustment period.,
Feed them a broad diet.,
Change the water frequently.",How to Keep a Bala Shark2," To help your bala sharks adjust to their new tank water, they’ll need to be acclimated. Remove ¼ of the their bag water and replace it with an equal amount from the tank. Then place them in the tank while still in their plastic water bags, and add one cup (237 milliliters) of tank water to the bag every ten minutes for one hour. Finally, gently net the fish from the bag, and dispose of the bag and its water., After bringing the fish home and putting them in the tank, you might notice that they are shy at first, and may not eat for a few days. This is normal behavior, because of the fright they experience during the trip from the store to your tank.


Be careful not to overfeed them during this period--try giving them small amounts a few times a day until their appetite improves., Bala Sharks like a variety of foods, including flakes, brine shrimp, mosquito larvae, chopped fruit, blanched spinach, shelled peas,sinking wafers, and live black worms.Generally, give them an even mixture of vegetable matter, flakes, and live food.Try to feed them 2 to 3 times per day. At each feeding, give them as much as they're able to eat in 3 minutes. If you only feed them once a day, give them what they can eat in 5 minutes., To keep your bala sharks in good health, they’ll need regular water changes. Replace 50% of the water at least once a month, and replace 25% at least every other week if the tank is densely populated.


When you replace the water, this is also a good time to clean the bottom of the tank, including rocks, with a vacuum siphon. Use an algae scraper as well to clean the glass panes."

Determine the size of the bullhead you are going to keep as a pet.,
Gather materials to replicate a natural environment.,
A good filter makes the job easy.,
Use a pre-cycled tank.,
And now for the fun part, feeding the bullhead!,
How long will your Bullhead live?,
Tend to an injured bullhead.,
Do a 25% water change at least once every week.

",How to Keep a Bullhead Catfish," When choosing a tank size remember that a bullhead needs 5 gallons (18.9 L) of water for every inch of its body. For example a 5 inch (12.7 cm) bullhead would need a 25 gallon (94.6 L) tank and an 17 inch (43.2 cm) bullhead would require an 85 gallon (321.8 L) tank. Get a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank for the early stages of the bullhead's life (0-4 inches), a 40 gallon (151.4 L) breeder tank for the adult stages of the Bullheads life (5-10 inches), and a 55 gallon (208.2 L) tank if the fish grows over 10 inches (25.4 cm). Larger tanks are always recommended.;
, A fairly thick layer of gravel is appreciated by bullheads because they love to dig nests and dig for food. Sand and leaves make good substrate, and you must add hiding spots for the bullhead, like rock caves, hollow driftwood, or a thick forest of aquatic plants, otherwise the bullhead will feel paranoid during daytime and shy away from interesting means of feeding.

, The best filter for bullheads would have to be canister filter as it has a high bioload capacity. Get a filter that is rated for 20% - 30% more gallons than your tank. For example a filter that is made for 40 gallons (151.4 L) being used on a 30 gallon (113.6 L) tank. Bullheads like current and oxygen which filters also provide.

, Once you've added the bullhead/s, put stress coat in. (A slime coat enhancing liquid sold at pet stores that relieves a new fishes stress.)

, Bullheads are opportunistic feeders which means they will eat a huge varied diet depending on what they have the opportunity to eat. Bullheads will eat any alive or dead fish that fits in their mouth, any vegetation or muck they can manage to find, any kind of meat they find, but most interestingly they don't eat each other! A varied diet is the key to a healthy happy bullhead. Try frozen blood worms, frozen brine shrimp, sinking fish foods, floating fish flakes, fish fillets, and feeder minnows that are all available at pet shops. You can also feed your Bullhead live bluegills, largemouth bass, tadpoles, frogs, crickets, flies, salamanders, scuds, crayfish and any live animals you find that will fit in their mouths. The two foods you should feed a Bullhead the most if you want it to grow big and strong are minnows and blood-worms. Blood worms work as an excellent source of fat and minnows are an excellent source of protein. You can even train your bullhead to come up to the top of the tank and eat out of your hand.

, Well bullheads can live anywhere from 5-12 years depending on the species and they will grow relatively fast. In the first year of life a bullhead will grow to 8 inches (20.3 cm) and then slowly grow until it maxes out at a length of 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) and weighs 1-5 pounds depending on the species of Bullhead.

, Bullheads are extremely tough fish and rarely get hurt without another animal involved. There are 3 main places a bullhead can get injured. the most common is an injured tail. Bullheads tend to get bullied by fin nipping territorial fish when kept in captivity which is a good reason to only keep bullheads with bullheads and don't keep fish like sunfish and bass live with a bullhead cause in the end you'll have an injured bullhead and a dead bass/sunfish. If a bullhead's tip of its tail gets nipped at it will easily heal back and the bullhead will continue to operate as if he is not injured. If the bullhead's tail is tore to the bone though he will never grow it back but instead will just be a tailless fish that amazingly swims around and functions as if he never lost his tail. The second most common injury is the loss of a barbel (whisker) which will most likely never grow back but since a bullhead has six barbels in the first place it doesn't matter so much. The third most common injury is the loss of eyes from being attacked by another fish which is an unfixable problem and the bullhead will have to rely on his whiskers for the rest of his life which is okay because catfish feed at nighttime anyway which is when eyes don't help much.

Introduce other fish if desired.",How to Keep a Bamboo Shark," The most important requirement for your new shark is that you buy a tank that is large enough. A small juvenile can be kept temporarily in a 30 gallon tank.Very soon, however, you'll need a much larger tank: 180 gallons is the minimum size for these sharks.Bamboo sharks are bottom dwellers and will rarely come up to the top of the tank. Therefore, if you are trying to choose between differently shaped tanks of similar size, choose the one with the largest bottom surface area.This will give your shark plenty of room to swim around.
Round or hexagonal tanks are best, as the corners of a rectangular tank will restrict the shark's swimming motion.;
, A tank of this size will be very heavy, once filled with water, rocks, and so on. Make sure to place it somewhere you are certain can bear the weight.A full 180 gallon tank can weigh close to 2000 pounds.If you place this on an upper floor, be certain the floor can withstand the weight.
You may even need to have a contractor add additional support from below, unless your tank will sit on a ground floor with no basement or crawl space., To keep aquarium conditions safe and comfortable for your bamboo shark, you'll need to add several devices to your tank to keep the water clean, warm, and circulating.


Sharks are carnivorous creatures that eat a lot and produce a lot of waste. It is important to have an effective filtration system to keep the water clean. Both an aquarium carbon filter and a protein skimmer are recommended.Both should be available at your aquarium store or online.
A pump, such as a sump pump that keeps water circulating will help your filtration system work better. It will also help break down harmful nitrates and oxygenate the water.Your shark will also enjoy some gentle water movement.Like any aquatic animal, it's also important to keep the water temperature comfortable for your shark. A temperature of 78-82 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal for bamboo sharks. You can achieve this by purchasing an aquarium heater rated at two to three watts per gallon of tank water., Bamboo sharks like lots of room to swim, but it's also good to give them some hiding places in the form of rocks and/or a small cave. Live rock (rock from the ocean that contains beneficial organisms) is a good choice, though not strictly necessary.Live rock will be available at many aquarium stores and can also be purchased online.
The bottom of the tank can be lined with sand to create a closer approximation of the ocean floor. Again, this isn't strictly necessary, but recreates a more natural environment for your shark.If your rocks will be piled up in such a way that they could be knocked over, some people think it's a good idea to glue them together using non-toxic aquarium glue. The bamboo shark is strong enough to knock rocks over, and you don't want yours to be injured by falling or sliding rocks., Bamboo sharks need clean salt water to live in. To create the ideal habitat for them, special preparation is required using water filters and aquarium salt.


Unless your tap water is utterly pristine, you shouldn't use it in your aquarium. Ideally, you should purchase a reverse osmosis de-ionization (RODI) water filter.This will remove all impurities from the water.
Likewise, ordinary salt isn't going to create a good environment for your shark. Buy a few buckets of aquarium salt. A five gallon bucket typically makes about 150 gallons of salt water., Fill up the tank with your water and salt, as directed by package instructions. Start up your pump and heater. Your tank is now ready.

, Be sure to buy from a reputable pet store. Your shark should look healthy, and should not have any wounds.


The shark should not appear to be ""panting"" or be overly lethargic. Its eyes and skin should not have any discolorations or white spots.
Sharks are prone to bacterial and parasitic infections. This can cause discoloration of the skin, frequent ""yawning,"" and chaffing on the bottom of the tank.Be watchful for any of these behaviors before purchasing a shark.

, Put your shark, with the pet store or shipping water, in a bucket or other large container with plenty of extra room.


Once you've brought your shark home, you can't simply dump it into the aquarium. The sudden change in chemistry between the pet store or shipping water and your aquarium water can be harmful or even fatal. , Slowly siphon some water out of your aquarium into the bucket using an air line or other narrow hose. Keep the water to a drip by clamping or crimping the hose.You can start a siphon by gently sucking on the hose until water begins to flow, or using an electric pump. You can also use an auto-siphon pump, a simple, inexpensive device available at any home brewing or wine making store., Once the water in the bucket has doubled, carefully pour most of it out, leaving just enough water to cover the shark., Slowly refill it again from the drip line. When the bucket is full again, you will have replaced about 95 percent of the pet store water with aquarium water. Your shark should be acclimated and you can now introduce it to the aquarium., Your new bamboo shark will eat foods such as uncooked shrimp, scallops, mussels, and pieces of fresh marine fish, squid or octopus. Cut any large food into bite-sized pieces.Do not feed your shark common feeder fish such as goldfish or guppies. These freshwater fish are not a natural food for bamboo sharks. If you wish to feed your shark live food, use silversides or sand eels.Bamboo sharks only need to be fed every two or three days. Give the shark a large portion of food a few times a week. If it loses weight, increase feeding. A juvenile shark should grow, but if an adult shark shows signs of weight gain, reduce the amount of food.When you first get your shark, it may be hesitant to eat. Providing live food such as saltwater feeder shrimp and fresh cockle (in the shell) may help entice it to eat.If it takes a few days to start eating, don't be alarmed. These sharks can survive a few weeks without eating., A clean aquarium is important to keep your shark healthy. Clean/replace the filters often, and change the water when necessary.


Your protein skimmer will need to be emptied approximately every other day.Follow package instructions for replacement of carbon filters.
When water becomes overly soiled (i.e. cloudy), you will need to change it. This will require large containers full of RODI filtered and salted water, and pumps to remove the old water while adding the new., Bamboo sharks can coexist with other fish if you want to make your aquarium more interesting. Be aware, however, that small fish will probably be eaten, and any crustaceans are likely to disappear very quickly.Bamboo sharks have been kept successfully with grunts, snappers, jacks, groupers, and goatfish."

Housing your silver dollar fish in a small, cramped tank can be very uncomfortable for your pet, and if you have more than one fish in the tank they may begin to compete for resources.


Some breeders recommend having a tank that holds at least 50 gallons of water to ensure adequate space.If you're considering housing a school of fish or breeding your own silver dollar fish you will need an even larger tank.;
, Silver dollar fish tend to uproot and eat live aquarium plants, which may deter some aquarium enthusiasts from providing plants.However, having plants (even if they're artificial) is generally considered preferable.Some aquarium enthusiasts add artificial plants to provide habitat for their fish without having to worry about the plants being eaten.
If you decide to breed your silver dollar fish they will absolutely need plants, even if they're artificial. Silver dollar fish tend to lay their eggs on or around plants near the bottom of the tank.

, Fish may become frightened or overwhelmed from time to time, so it's important to provide them with places to escape from whatever has frightened them. This is particularly important if you plan on housing more than one fish in the same tank.Rocks, flowerpots, driftwood, and plastic accessories are all considered acceptable hiding places to add to your home aquarium.

, Silver dollar fish need a diet high in plants and vegetables. Commercial Spirulina-based foods and vegetable-based freeze-dried/flake foods are ideal. You can also feed your fish certain live foods, including brine shrimp, bloodworms, and glass worms.Feed your fish pellets or flakes several times each day.Watch your fish while it eats to gauge whether it's getting enough food and adjust accordingly.
Some breeders choose to supplement their pets' diet with small chunks of vegetables, including zucchini and romaine lettuce leaves. However, these should be trimmed down to very small pieces so that the fish can easily eat and digest them.

, Because silver dollar fish naturally swim in schools, it's best to keep your fish in a shared tank with other community tank fish (including other silver dollar fish). Just be sure any fish you add to the tank are known to be friendly and peaceful.If you decide not to add other silver dollar fish, you may choose to add loricariidae, pimelodidae, South or Central American cichlids, pacu, arowana, or anostomus.Having too many fish in the tank may cause territorial disputes or overcrowding.
Groups of three to six schooling fish of a similar size are the ideal number for a given tank.

, All pets are at risk of illness, regardless of how well you care for them. Some fish breeds are more predisposed to health problems than others. Knowing what health problems silver dollar fish are prone to can help you keep an eye on your pet's wellbeing.Silver dollar fish are particularly susceptible to a parasite called black spot/black ick.You can treat this condition with aquarium salt available at pet stores.
Because of their flat bodies, silver dollar fish are prone to constipation. This can be avoided by feeding a varied diet that includes fiber (vegetable matter).
Many fish, including silver dollars, are susceptible to fungal infections. These can be easily treated at home with commercial products, which can be purchased at most pet stores., Because silver dollar fish tend to naturally inhabit waterways in South America, they typically thrive in slightly warmer water temperatures. Use a water heater and keep a thermometer in or near the tank so you can regulate the temperature as needed.The ideal water temperature range for silver dollar fish is between 75 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit (23.9 to 27.8 degrees Celsius). However, they may be able to survive in temperatures as low as 71.6 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius)., Percent hydrogen, or pH, is a measure of how acidic or basic a sample of water is. Some breeders recommend maintaining a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.However, silver dollar fish can survive in water with a pH as low as 5.0 and as high as 7.8.Check the pH every time you change the water. You may also want to test the pH of your water source to ensure that you're not introducing acidic or basic water to an otherwise stable environment.
You can raise the pH by adding an alkaline buffer and lower it by adding an acid buffer.Both products can be purchased at most pet stores or through an online retailer.

, General hardness is a measurement of how much calcium carbonate is dissolved in the water.Silver dollar fish generally prefer soft water with 70 to 140 parts per million of dissolved calcium carbonate.The ideal range of water hardness for silver dollar fish is between 4 and 8 dH.
You can soften hard water by using a reverse osmosis unit or by adding aquarium peat, available at many pet stores or online.You can harden soft water by adding calcium-based rocks to your tank., You should completely change the water at least once every month to ensure a stable habitat.However, changing the water too frequently can deplete the bacteria your fish rely on. Because of this, it's recommended that fish owners perform partial water changes in which approximately 25% of the water is replaced. Partial changes can be performed about once every two weeks, though tanks that get dirty very quickly may need more frequent partial water changes.You may not be able to use tap water for your aquarium, depending on the mineral and chemical composition of your water. Test your water at home before using it in your aquarium.


Unplug any electrical devices, such as your heater and/or an overhead lamp.
Scoop out your fish using a hand net and transfer them to a safe bucket or second tank while you clean. Then remove and clean the filter and any artificial plants or decorative accessories you may have submerged in your tank.
Use a gravel cleaner to siphon out debris from the bottom of your tank. However, you should not use a gravel cleaner if your fish have recently laid eggs in the aquarium.
Reverse osmosis water does not have any impurities, but it also lacks minerals that your fish may need.If possible, use only deionized water for your fish tank.Measure the temperature of your water and adjust the clean water's temperature accordingly before adding it to the aquarium. Then replace the items you removed and scoop your fish back into their primary tank.

, If you're interested in breeding silver dollar fish, you'll need to learn how to identify the males and females of the species so you can provide a suitable mate for your fish. Male silver dollar fish tend to have an anal fin that is longer than females. The anal fin is usually tinted red on most males as well., Once you've identified the males and females of the species, you'll want to pair them up in equal proportions in your aquarium. However, it's generally best to add more than one fish to the tank and let the fish pair themselves up, rather than trying to mate a particular pair of fish.Mix four to six fish with equal proportions of male to female (for example, if using four fish you would have two of each; if using six fish, have three of each). Let the fish decide how they want to pair up and don't interfere.

, While some aquarium enthusiasts may be reluctant to provide silver dollar fish with aquatic plants, your fish will need some type of underwater plants during mating. These can even be artificial plants if you're worried about your fish eating the plants.Silver dollar fish tend to lay their eggs on or around underwater plants.

, If you're trying to breed your silver dollar fish, you'll need to ensure that you don't accidentally remove the eggs or hatched fry while cleaning your tank. Eggs hatch within about three days, and within a week the fry will begin to swim around inside the tank and attach themselves to the walls of the tank.Try to hold off on cleaning the tank for a few days until the eggs are hatched and the fry are visible.
Avoid using tank vacuums to clean your aquarium while there are eggs or fry present. Instead, try to do partial water changes and be sure you can see the fry at all times.

Panda Cory's also work well in a smaller tank setting. Larger tanks, can hold larger breeds of corydoras such as Upside-down Catfish or Bronze corydoras (Corydoras aeneus). A catfish breed such as Synodontis Multipunctatus Catfish (not a corydoras) need a minimum tank size of 50 gallons (189.3 L).;
, Different species of catfish prefer different temperatures. Hasbrosus corydoras prefer a temperature of 73–79 °F (23–26 °C), but can withstand temperatures from 68-85 degrees.

, The catfish should be able to have dark hiding spot where other fish won't bother him/her. Having decorations such as a cave will be appreciated by the catfish.

, Catfish eat algae and uneaten food from other fish, but they also eat vegetables and algae wafers.

, Most catfish survive better if they are in schools of 4-6+. If you have a smaller (less than 20 gallon tank) and you want to have more than one or two corydoras, you should probably choose a dwarf breed.

, Sites like http://www.planetcatfish.com/catelog/ provide a long list of many types of catfish and provide all the information on aquarium size and temperature.

In order to move forward on your intention to start a hatchery, there are some determinations you need to know up front. Most simply, know what type of fish you will raise – and why – in order to start setting up your hatchery or writing a business plan. In particular, consider the following, and have concrete answers to each before moving forward.


What are you going to do with all the fish? Will you raise fish destined to be food, pets, or simply pond ornaments?
Do you intend to take the backyard approach and build a custom fishing hole for you and your friends, or are you looking to build a business empire based on the for-profit production of the finest fish on the global market?;
, The type of fish you raise will be determined in part by the type of hatchery you hope to start. While the system you hope to build may influence your decision about what fish you will raise, there are several factors to consider about your options regarding the fish themselves.Once you’re leaning towards a certain type of fish, contact hatcheries that raise that type to see about the viability of going through with stocking your hatchery.
Recognize that the costs associated with raising different types of fish will vary widely, for all sorts of reasons – including the amount of management different species require and the cost of the food they eat.
Also consider the climate in which you will be operating your hatchery. Certain fish need certain temperature water to live in. If possible, you may want to avoid costs associated with heating or cooling water, which can be substantial.

, Tilapia are some of the easiest fish to raise, and are eaten around the world. As such, they are among the most profitable types of fish to raise. They are hardy enough to tolerate different water conditions, including low oxygen and high ammonia, and are even more resistant to illness than many other fish.Tilapia need to be raised in water as close as possible to 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius). They will survive in water from 64-90 F (18-32 C), but will die if the water drops to 50 degrees.
While there are many different types of tilapia, Bava, Blue, and Nile tilapia are the most appropriate for backyard and commercial hatcheries.

, Catfish are increasingly popular in people’s cuisine, and they’re some of the tougher fish there are in terms of resistance to disease and parasites. They also grow quite quickly. Channel catfish are one of the most popular – and profitable – choices for backyard farming, and there are several types to choose from.Recommended water temperatures for raising catfish vary based on the season and age of the fish. A such, catfish are commonly raised in outdoor ponds.
Specifically, channel catfish fingerlings need to be stocked when water temperatures are between 65-68 degrees Fahrenheit (18-20 C). As catfish, they will grow more quickly in water between 83-86 degrees Fahrenheit (28-30 C)., Bass is unique in that many people actually prefer the taste of farmed bass to wild bass. Raising bass is most feasible in larger, well-circulated systems. Bass fingerlings, however, are more sensitive than many other young fish, and require strict nutritional supply, gentle handling, and even particular amounts of light.Raising bass may require extra holding tanks, as different sized individuals need to be stored separately.
Bass prefer water as close as possible to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius), but can survive in water ranging from 65-85 F (18-29 C).

, Trout and salmon are especially popular for human consumption, but they require more specific conditions than the other fish mentioned in this article. When raised at sustainable, well-run operations, these types of fish can be reliably profitable options. Yellow perch is popular in some markets too, though perch does not have the global popularity of trout and salmon. All three can grow to harvestable size in only one season.Trout and salmon can be raised together, providing some variety in your production.
Keep water in which you’re raising trout and salmon between 55 and 60 F (13-16 C).
If you’re only raising trout, water can be a bit warmer, but monitor oxygen levels more closely.
Rainbow and brook trout are particularly popular, as are coho and Atlantic salmon.

, Before beginning construction of a hatchery of any size or type, account for the law in your area. There are lots and lots of laws about raising animals, and even more about raising animals to be consumed as food. Further, the ways in which your hatchery may effect the surrounding land or water need to be addressed before you move forward with starting a hatchery.


Depending on the type, size, and location of your hatchery, the paperwork will vary – but count on there being a lot of it.
If planning to operate a production hatchery, you’ll need to get a business license as well. Then there’s the whole other side of the law – and a whole new stack of paperwork.

, One option for a hatchery that doesn’t take up a lot of space is raising an aquarium fish for the fish-as-pet-or-decoration market. Rare types of fish that are popular amongst those who keep aquariums are usually not raised on high production equipment, and can be hatched indoors in a few small tanks and with far less equipment than needed for larger hatcheries.Angelfish, for instance, can easily be raised on equipment that you can get altogether in a ready-to-use set.
For different types of fish, you’ll need different types of specific filters, tanks, and water-treating equipment, and fish food. For small aquariums, however, most of these will be available at specialty pet stores.
Choose a breed of fish – such as angelfish – that are already commonly sold in pet stores, so you know you’ll have demand for the glittery critters as soon as they’re ready to find a home of their own.

, If you’re not familiar with the industry, you’ll need to acquire some first-hand experience before starting your own hatchery. Even if you do have some experience, owning and operating a hatchery of your own will require substantial knowledge of your specific operation and of the industry in general. If you only intend to own and oversee the business side of a hatchery, you still need to know enough to make business decisions and hire competent personnel to run your business.Work at a running hatchery that’s as similar as possible to the sort of hatchery you envision opening.
Consult online resources and print publications, many of which are specific to certain styles of hatcheries or to raising certain types of fish.
Take courses on fishery operations at a university or trade school. This is a good idea early on, as the broad, supplemental knowledge provided by a classroom course will help you make decisions about the type of hatchery you’d like to start.

, A solid business plan will be vital to acquire any necessary investment capital. Aside from a fair amount of commercial equipment, you’ll also need the capital to get the business running and to pay employees to help you keep it running. Aside from luring investors, you’ll need a business plan to help meet potential business partners, and to get loans.Include a clear and specific feasibility report in your business plan. This should include thorough calculations of your initial expenses, operating costs, and anticipated profits for the first few years of business.
Know that the anticipated costs of starting a hatchery depends entirely on the type of hatchery you wish to start. Though small backyard setup may cost as little as a few hundred dollars, a production facility will require thousands of dollars of investment in equipment alone.

, The capital and operating costs of starting a business – especially a production business – can wind up being far more than expected. Prepare yourself fully to have accurate expectations and to acquire a sufficient amount of initial capital. Carefully weigh both general and specific considerations, and don’t forget to consider important factors aside from the specifics of the hatchery itself.Ensure that there is sufficient demand in the market to meet the level of sales you need to be successful financially.
Consider whether a hatchery is the best possible use of the specific real estate and capital you intend to use.
Reflect honestly on whether you personally have the time and financial security to start a new business.

, Be ready to quote the anticipated costs of stocking your hatchery initially, fish food, electricity and other power, labor, water treatment chemicals, insurance, taxes, and extraneous things like maintenance and transportation. Knowing as much as possible will ensure you make accurate estimates of both initial startup costs and operating costs.Unforeseen costs can greatly hinder a new company, and the best way to prevent them is by knowing you’ve thought of everything.

, Make sure you’ve considered potentially expensive necessities in particular. For instance, even if you already have the land, think about what needs to be done to it. Will anything need to be dug or built? Further, what will hold the fish? All costs need to be accounted for – down to the safety equipment your staff will wear.In a large scale production you’ll need a tractor, ample storage space, and maybe even trucks.
Have you accounted for all the piping that will connect tanks and ponds and water equipment?
What about oxygen meters and other testing supplies?

, Though raising fish may not seem like a business endeavor that requires advertising, a marketing plan will greatly help get your business up and running. If there is an established market, how are you going to break into it? Will demand be consistent year-round? Consider where will be ideal for focused sales efforts., Though unpleasant to think about, you have to account for the potential risks inherent to your business. One classic consideration is whether you could survive if you lost an entire crop of fish. You’ll need the investment necessary to be able to do so, as losing an entire crop is a realistic possibility.Develop a plan for a backup water source if your current source drops below an allowable quality threshold.
Assess and address the risk for contamination by pesticides, metal, or anything else at the location in mind.
Develop and maintain contacts for advice and information, even before you need it - particularly in terms of fish health.

, A small pond is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to start a small fish hatchery, for either personal use or local sales. Still, it will likely cost at least a few thousand dollars to get a pond-based hatchery up and running. Further, the size of your pond and the climate where you live will determine which fish will be most viable for you to raise.Municipal water is often okay to fill an artificial pond, though pumping water from a natural body of water near your home may be preferable.
Make sure that you are not violating any laws or regulations by manipulating any natural bodies of water or watersheds by checking with your local fish, wildlife and environmental regulatory agencies.
In areas where ponds may freeze, you can pump and cycle water through an artificial heater to keep the pond warm and liquid-enough for fish to survive in. Cold climates, however, will substantially increase the cost of operation and the risk involved in running your hatchery.

, When stocking your pond with fingerlings, use the capacity of your pond to determine the number of fish it can safely hold. Depending on the type of fish you choose to raise, maintain the pond at a certain size and depth.Take extreme care not to overcrowd the pond, as water quality and fish health can rapidly deteriorate in an overcrowded body of water.

, Aquatic plants are very helpful for multiple reasons. In an immediate sense, they provide cover for your fish during the day. Furthermore, plants help keep a pond ecologically balanced and will make a small pond a fish-raising haven with very little effort on your part.Determine the types of plants to include in your pond based on the type of fish you plan to raise, as well the types of plants that grow naturally in ponds in your area.

, Another benefit of backyard pond hatcheries is that you can likely feed your fish less often, since your fish will be able to eat plants and insects. Even for rapid growth and a quick harvest, you’ll only have to feed your fish once in a while.Be careful not to over-feed your fish, as this may contribute to illnesses, more bacteria in the water, and decreased water quality overall.
To determine whether your fish are in need of more food, observe their behavior when you add food to the water. If the fish go into a frenzy and eat all the food extremely quickly, start to feed them slightly more regularly.

, If there is already a body of water present on land you have access to, you can likely set up a small fish hatchery with readily available materials. For instance, a cage can be built with plastic piping and netting, and then anchored to the edge of a body of water and used to culture fish.Make sure the water you have access to is suitable for raising fish before deciding to start a hatchery in a natural body of water.
Stock the cage with fingerlings and simply feed them until they are large enough to harvest.
For a small cage culture, expect to pay for only cage materials, fingerlings, and food – which may cost as little as $100 altogether.

, Divert a continuous source of cold water, such as a natural stream or river, into corridors that can contain fish while allowing them to swim in flowing water. You will likely need less water than you think – but the flow must remain constant. In the right location, flow-through hatcheries can be a relatively simple way to raise fish.Be aware of additional regulations involved with diverting and benefiting from the use of natural resources. Contact local conservation authorities to discuss your plans.
This is the method used to help many government-run conservation efforts. However, this method is harder to set up than many other options, is often not allowed, and is not as commercially viable as other options.

, For larger-scale pond-based hatcheries, you will need several ponds, a good amount of land, and a substantial amount of additional equipment. Conceptualize scaling up a pond-based hatchery as the equivalent endeavor of going from having a garden to having a commercial farm – it will require a huge amount of planning, time and investment.

, One of the limitations of ponds is the amount to literal space they take up. While ponds offer a great method of raising fish in limited quantities, container-based fish hatcheries can handle a higher production capacity within a relatively limited amount of space.Municipal water supplies are usually fine to fill tanks, though the water will likely need to be treated.
Know that aquaponics systems come with far larger start-ups costs, a greater need for supplies and equipment, and a greater knowledge of commercial fish farming.

, Whatever the type of hatchery you intend to run – and especially for an aquaponics production hatchery – you’ll need a pump to help you ensure that your fish always have sufficient fresh water. Similarly, the water in which your fish live will likely require a steady influx of oxygen provided by aeration equipment.Pumps are also often necessary to cycle water from holding tanks to recycling pools or equipment that can clean the water and remove impurities.
The more fish you’re trying to raise, especially in an indoor hatchery, the more water cleaning and aeration equipment you’ll need.

, For production fisheries, you’ll need lots of equipment to deal with your product. In industry terms, you’re going to need a seine. Seines are used to harvest fish, or collect them from the water. As you harvest the fish, you’ll need to sort them by size. You’ll also need a way to handle the fish and potentially a way to transport fish to buyers.For larger scale hatcheries, you’ll need reels and other equipment that can be used to drag large nets. You’ll likely need a tractor and hoists to handle nets full of fish.
As fish are graded, they will need to be moved to different holding tanks. You can also use counting equipment to keep track of your crop.

Choose how many mollies you want.,
Purchase your mollies.,
Transfer your fish to the tank.",How to Breed Molly Fish," Mollies are hierarchical fish. Whichever male has the biggest fins and boldest colors leads the way. This means the ideal combination of male and female fish is one male for multiple females. You may see the male under the female; this is how the fish copulate.
If their mating is successful, their babies should be born in about 3 to 5 weeks.;
, Place the female in a separate “nurser” tank if possible. The male fish often chases around the female, wishing to copulate more, and this could cause stress on the pregnancy. You’ll be able to tell the molly is pregnant by a very distended belly.


If the “nurser” tank is not possible, consider using an aquarium net breeder, which is essentially a mesh cube with plastic edges, to protect the mother and baby fish.Removing the mother from the main aquarium is also to protect the fry. Molly fish often cannibalize their babies.
Don’t wait too close to the birth date. Stressed mollies may have more aborted births and stillborn., The female may eat her own young, so it’s best to move her back with the other fish for the safety of the fry. Roughly once per month, however, the mother may need to be re-segregated since female molly fish can retain multiple fertilized eggs for nearly half a year. , Use ground fish food of the same type that you feed to your adult mollies. Flake food should be used as a primary base. Supplement the normal meals with a broad variety of denser meals. Various worms are great for molly fish. Grindal worms, black worms, and blood worms work well.
Brine shrimp, live or frozen, are a preferred source of food.
Molly fish even eat algae, which is their primary food in the wild., It will take around nearly two months to be able to tell males and females apart. Once they’ve doubled in size, it’s probably safe to introduce them into the main tank with the rest of the fish. Another good way to tell if they’re safe to interact with the other fish is if they are too big to fit into the other fishes mouths., Once you know the gender of the mollies, you'll need to ensure more breeding doesn't take place. They will, in fact, breed between brothers and sisters. Try to separate the male and female fish before they are eight weeks old, which is when they reach sexual maturity., You'll need a tank that holds around 15g – 30g water (56L-113L). In general, molly fish do better with larger fish tanks and more room to swim around. Smaller tanks may create a variety of problems:Less swimming room to get away from aggressive fish, which creates stress
Harder to clean, which can lead to sickness

, Choose such decorations as rocks, air filters and decorative gravel. In general, molly fish should have enough room to swim around quite freely, but also enough decorations to hide from bully fish. The less aggressive fish will more around in the tank to hide from bully fish.If there aren’t enough hiding spots, the fish could become stressed.

, The substrate should provide the base to your tank, but also serve potential nutrients to any plants inside the aquarium. In general, the substrate should be comprised of two levels:


The top level should be 2 inches of something sturdy, like sand, pebbles, or gravel.
The bottom level should be 1-2 inches of nutrient-rich material., Up to 2 inches (4cm) under the brim of the tank is ideal. The water should be warm – 78-82° F (25-27° C) – so the molly fish are comfortable, like they would be in tropical waters. Do not overfill the tank or put in cold water.


An aquarium heater will probably be necessary.
Replace water on a fairly regimented schedule. Daily minimal water changes, or up to 30% per week, are recommend., Some molly fish are brackish, which means they have a varying requirement for freshwater and saltwater.There is a fairly large debate, however, about whether or not they need marine salt in the aquarium. Some experts contend most molly fish never see salty or brackish waters, and it’s not necessary for the water.Some sources indicate that approximately one Tbsp per five gallons of water is good.The addition of salt may act as a healing attribute, a way to overcome slightly dirty water.If you buy an exotic breed of molly, you may want to consult with an expert to be sure you can go completely without salt.

, Ultimately, the water should have a fairly neutral Ph level between 7 and 8. Some experts recommend increasing the Ph by just a bit, to 8.4After the tank is filled, adjustments to the filter and water may be necessary.

, It is best to allow the tank to cycle, because the water is lacking beneficial bacteria, which leaves fish susceptible to illness and disease. Carefully monitor your aquarium if you can't wait before adding your fish.

, Generally, a good fit for the fish is a couple mollies per 10 gallon tank. They need ample room to swim around and, if you end up with multiple fry, room to hide from the more aggressive fish. If you want more than just a couple, you should use the recommended larger tank.

, Go to your local pet store and pick male and female fish. While there are several varieties of molly fish, they are extremely easy to breed because all colors are the same species, and all males and females breed with one another.Some recommend getting the subspecies of mollies for quicker breeding. You can ask the employees at the store for help, or you can do it yourself.


Male molly have a gonopodium, a long stick-like fin used to fertilize the female, on his lower half.Female molly have a softer, fan-shaped anal fin, which is also on the lower half of the body.

, Set the bag of fish in the tank for 10-15 minutes, to allow the water to become the same temperature. Release the fish into the aquarium/tank by using a net to get the fish from the bag.


Do not introduce the water from the bag into the tank
Feed the other fish before adding in the new mollies. You don’t want them to think the mollies are food.

Adjust conditions if your neon tetras are not breeding.,
Remove the adult tetras from the tank.,
Wait for the baby tetras to hatch.,
Keep the baby tetras in the dark.,
Feed your fry special food.,
Introduce your baby neon tetras to your adult neon tetras.,
Limit your tetras to two inches of fish for every gallon of water.,
Find homes for extra neon tetras.",How to Breed Neon Tetras," You will need more than one tank in order to breed tetras, so get another one if you do not have one already. You can use a 12 x 8 x 8 inch (30 x 20 x 20cm) tank to breed your tetras.You will use this tank to bring a male and female tetra together for breeding and also as a place incubate the eggs and baby tetras.


You can set this tank up similar to how you have your normal tank set up. Just keep in mind that the water will need to be soft and kept at a specific temperature and acidity in order for breeding to happen.;
, When you are breeding neon tetras, the water in your breeding tank needs to be kept at about 77 degrees Fahrenheit.The water also needs to be soft (low-mineral content) and slightly acidic (with a pH of 5-6) in order for neon tetras to thrive. This type of environment is what best mimics the natural environment of a neon tetra. If the water in your tank does not meet these requirements, you will need to:


get a tank thermometer to monitor the water temperature.
test the pH of the water daily using pH test strips (available at pet stores)
mix one part tap water with three parts reverse osmosis water to make soft water for your tank OR use fresh rainwater, A filtration system can help to remove waste products and bacteria from the aquarium, which will protect the health of your tetras. A filtration system can also remove bacteria from the aquarium and keep it looking its best. Corner box filters are ideal for breeding tanks because they are gentle., Tetras need a dark environment to thrive, so do not place your tetras near a sunny window or in another place that gets a lot of light. Tetras do not need total darkness, but they do need to be placed somewhere that gets only a small amount of light each day.You may even want to cover the back and sides of your tank in dark paper to block out excess light.

, It is not absolutely necessary to sex your tetras before you begin breeding because you can put several into the tank together and breeding should occur.However, if you want to sex your tetras, male and female tetras have some distinct differences that can help you tell them apart.


Female tetras tend to be wider and fatter than male tetras.
Some breeders also claim that male tetras have a straight stripe and females have a crooked stripe., Evening is the best time to introduce your adult tetras into the tank, so plan to put your adult tetras into the tank after the sun has set. Keep in mind that the tetras that you use for breeding will have to be at least 12 weeks old or breeding may not be possible.Allow the fish to stay in the tank for a day or two. Tetras should spawn after being kept in the tank for about one to two days.

, If breeding is not happening, then check the pH and temperature of the water, soften the water a bit more, and adjust the lighting as needed. It may take some time and experimenting to get the conditions just right for your neon tetras to breed.


Changing the water softness seems to trigger spawning because it mimics rainfall. Try adding a large amount of soft water to the tank if your neon tetras are not spawning after a few days., Fish eggs are small and hard to see because of their translucent color, but you may be able to see them in the gravel or on plants in your breeding tank.As soon as you notice eggs in the tank, make sure that you remove the adult tetras from the tank or they may eat the eggs.

, There may be between 60 to 130 eggs, but not all of them will hatch.After the eggs are lain, they will take about 24 hours to hatch. You can expect about 40 to 50 baby tetras to hatch from the eggs.The baby tetras will look like small splinters of glass swimming around the tank., The baby tetras, also known as “fry,” will need to be kept in the dark for about five days after they hatch. Baby tetras are light sensitive and they need a dark environment in order to thrive.


To keep the tank dark, you can cover the entire tank in dark construction paper or use a piece of cardboard to block out the light.You can use a dim flashlight to look in from the top of the tank during feedings, but be brief when you do so.

, You cannot feed your baby tetras the same food that the adult tetras eat, so you will need to give them some special food intended for baby fish.These foods should be labeled as appropriate for fry. Ask at your local pet store if you are not sure which foods are appropriate for your baby tetras.


After a few days, you can start to feed the baby tetras baby brine shrimp as well. You can buy baby brine shrimp in pet stores., After about three months, you can place your new neon tetras into the tank with your adult neon tetras. Do not try to place them into the tank before because they may be eaten, injured, or bullied by the adult fish.Keep in mind that some of the tetras may die no matter what you do. Baby fish are more prone to disease and more sensitive to injuries.

, This is a general rule for fish tanks that can help you determine how many tetras you can keep in your tank at one time. Adult neon tetras are about two inches long, so you can divide the gallon size of your tank to find the number of neon tetras you may keep in the tank.For example, if you have a 50 gallon (190 L) tank, then you can have 25 tetras in your tank.

, Since many neon tetras may be produced from one breeding attempt, you may find yourself with more neon tetras than you can accommodate. Ask friends if they would be interested in having some neon tetras. Make sure that your friends have the appropriate equipment and resources to care for the fish.


You can also try calling your local pet store to see if they are interested in purchasing some. Just keep in mind that pet stores only pay between $0.11 and $0.30 per neon tetra, so you will not make much money unless you sell in large quantities."

Add Caves to Your Established Aquarium.,
Add java moss.,
The male will choose a cave.,
Transfer Eggs to Breeder Box (optional step).,
Gently Remove Cave from Tank.,
Caring for Fry


Gudgeon fry hatch within 1-3 days, and remain attached to the cave until they consume the egg sac and need to eat infusoria.,
Baby gudgeons need very clean water:


no ammonia or nitrites, nitrates below 40ppm
Maintain a neutral pH of 6.5-7.5.

,
Consider following a water change schedule.",How to Breed Peacock Gudgeons," Decorate your aquarium with small caves (the narrower the better). The male prefers a 3"" long x1"" diameter PVC pipe with both ends open. He may block one end with substrate. To make caves smaller, bury them in the substrate so that they are no more than half full of substrate.;
, This will give infusoria (tiny organisms that will be eaten by the fry) a place to live. Other fuzzy plants will do too. Try java ferns, mosses, hair-grass.

, He then performs his mating dance and nudges the female into the cave where they will spawn. Afterwards, he will kick her out, and fan the eggs for 3-4 days until hatched. If you leave the eggs in the tank, they will probably be eaten by the parents. Chances of survival are best if eggs are removed to a separate tank/breeder box.

, Set up your breeder box according to the package directions. There are several kinds of fish breeder box. Some go inside the tank and use the flow of the tank filter. External boxes may require a small air pump and tubing to circulate water. Proper air flow is necessary to prevent fungus from growing on the eggs. Once the eggs are no longer being fanned by the male, be sure to place the cave so that water circulates through it. Try turning the end toward the filter output or airstone.

, Tilt it to let the male fall out (he may stay with it to the surface). Set the cave down in the breeder box.

, They swim near the surface.

,,


Do a 10% water change daily in the first week after hatching.
Perform weekly 30% water changes until fry reach sexual maturity in 7-9 months.

,
Expect some of your fry to not make it through the transition from a fry to a fish.One of the hardest transitions in the life of a clownfish is when they move from their larval stage to being a juvenile clownfish.To give them a good shot at developing, transition their food from rotifers to live brine shrimp so that they can get enough energy to grow rapidly.,
Watch as your fry turn into juvenile fish.",How to Breed Clownfish," Breeding fish is a project that should be taken on by people who are experienced with saltwater aquarium set up and maintenance. While breeding these fish is not difficult, it does require a bit of knowledge about fish feeding and life cycles, not to mention having the right supplies to assure proper tank filtration and ecosystem development.


If you want to begin setting up your own aquarium, you may want to consult How to Start a Saltwater Aquarium or How to Set up a Marine Reef Aquarium before diving into breeding fish.;
, Clownfish are external breeders, meaning that the female fish lays eggs and then the male fish fertilizes them after they have been laid. To make this happen you will need to get a pair of clownfish that are already bonded, in other words mated to each other.


Many aquarium stores will sell mated pairs specifically for clownfish breeding. If your store does not have any in stock, they can probably special order a pair just for you. Don't be afraid to ask!

, The other way you can get a mated pair is to develop two young clownfish into a bonded pair yourself. Begin by buying two clownfish when they are still young. One of the amazing things about clownfish is that they are all born neither male or female, so you don't have to worry about getting one male and one female.Any pair will do.


Developing into a male or female fish only occurs as the fish get older. The sex of your fish will actually be determined by the dominance of the fish when fighting each other. The dominant fish will change sex into a female and the less dominant will become male.
If you are keeping a lot of clownfish in the same tank, only one bonded pair will develop. The most dominant of all will become female and the second most dominant will become male. The rest will remain sexless.If you want to keep the fighting to a minimum and make the fish change sex as quickly as possible, it is a good idea to get one clownfish that is larger than the other, that way it is clear from the get go which one is dominant.

, Clownfish are not as sensitive to water conditions as other fish can be, but keeping the water clean can make them more likely to breed.

, Placing anemone in the tank to make the clownfish feel more comfortable. Although this is not totally necessary, it will increase the likelihood that your pair will breed. You should also have live rock in your tank. Live rock is rock that is from the ocean and is the foundation of the development of coral reefs. The live rock will provide the fish have hiding places and will give a surface on which the clownfish can lay and care for their eggs.

, Keep it light during the day and dark at night on a regular schedule. This regularity will keep your clownfish more relaxed, and thus more likely to spawn.

, The female, the bigger of your two fish, will get thicker around her middle, indicating she is getting ready to release eggs. Both fish may also start to clean the rocks with their mouth and fins to get it ready for the eggs.

, Once the eggs are laid they will be orange in color and attached to the rocks. The male clownfish will care for them, swimming around them and waving his fins on them to aerate them. He may also pick off the ones that have died.

, Clownfish eggs go through multiple stages of development. As stated before, they begin as an orange color but shift


The eggs should hatch in about 7 to 10 days. You will need to feed the fry live rotifers for the first week. Rotifers are plankton that many species feed on. After that, you can start to introduce live brine shrimp. Clownfish babies will only eat live food.

, It does not need to be very big, a 10 gallon (37.8 l) tank will do fine for the hatchlings. Make sure the tank does not have a large filtration system but instead has an air stone that lets off little bubbles or some other more gentle means of oxygenation.Too much filtration could easily kill all your tiny fry.


You must also provide proper lighting for the fry since they will be searching for food but their vision is not the greatest. The light shouldn't be too bright, one light bulb is sufficient, and should be as diffused as possible.

, Some breeders move the eggs before they hatch but most wait until the hatchlings come out of their eggs, as moving the hatchlings is easier.Either way, you will need to raise the fry in a separate aquarium as clownfish are known to eat their own eggs and hatchlings. Be sure to get the extra tank ready ahead of time.

, While in the egg sack, the embryos use energy from the yoke to survive, but once they emerge, the hatchlings will need food fast!


Clownfish hatchlings should be fed live rotifers, which are microscopic aquatic animals.These can sometimes be found at an aquarium store but you should check with your's to make sure.
Many clownfish breeders find it easier to breed rotifers for their hatchlings to eat, than it is to find them at an aquarium store. Make sure you have a steady supply of them before beginning the breeding process, otherwise your hatchlings will die at this stage.

,, You can also add nutrients to the water, such as those sold for keep saltwater reef tanks healthy., If the fish make it through the transition, you should start seeing the distinctive color of the clownfish develop on your fish. They should continue to grow rapidly, so make sure you continue to give them enough food and to keep their water clear and clean.

Ship.",How to Bag and Ship Live Fish1," Place the fish in a separate tank with the proper temperature and very clean water. It's best you not feed the fish for about two days. Check for any signs of disease, since you don't want to sell your customer diseased fish.;
, When shipping fish, it is best to do it via overnight shipping. This usually more expensive, but the fish has best chances of arriving alive with this method.

, Fill the rest of the bag up with fresh air, or oxygen.


Triple, or quadruple bag the fish (put the bags inside each other).
Tightly rubber band the bags closed. Attach a clip just in case also.

Carefully transport fry to a 5+ gallon, aerated tank with a bubble filter or you don't have to have a filter but replace water 100% every week and make sure that the water is the same temperature.,
Feed the fry.,
When they are large enough to eat regular food, you can put them in your main tank, again avoiding overcrowding.",How to Breed and Care for Platies4," There is no way to induce mating but you can tell if they are pregnant if they are getting fatter.

,, If so you can put her in a plastic breeder or net which will separate the babies (fry) from the rest the fish. Once she has given birth to all of them, this could be 20-50+ babies, remove the mother.

, Make sure it does not have a power filter because fry will get sucked up.

, You can give them finely powdered fish food or specialty fry food 3-4 times a day. Live food is best (freshly hatched baby brine shrimp) will ensure good quality fish and bright colours.

, Platies that are 1⁄2 or 3⁄4 inch (1.3 or 1.9 cm) long are large enough to place with adults.

Select the species you would like to breed.,
Sex your fish.,
Let the fish do their thing.,
Watch for females to become pregnant.,
Separate the females before they give birth.,
Wait and watch for the birth.,
Feed your fish well.,
Spread the fry out when they’re grown.,
Prepare to have lots of fish.",How to Breed Livebearing Tropical Fish," Several varieties of live-bearers are available from most pet stores, including guppies, platies, mollies, swordtails, and Endlers. All of these have similar needs. Whichever variety you select, ask for a 50/50 mix of males and females.Live breeders will do well in a standard 20-30 gallon tank setup. Ask your pet store if you are unsure of how to set up an aquarium.;
, Even if your store promises an even mix of females and males, you will need to know the gender of each fish so you can separate them later on. Live breeders have a few characteristics that you can use to sex the fish:Females have triangular anal fins located under the belly.
Males have a modified anal fin that appears spiky. It is used to inseminate females.
Females tend to be larger than males, since they will carry young live.
Sometimes, males are more colorful and patterned than females.

, If you place male and female live breeders in a tank together, there is a good chance they will mate before too long. You shouldn’t have to do anything to help the process.If you want to selectively breed fish of a particular color or pattern, be sure to place a roughly equal number of males and females of that type only in your aquarium.
If necessary, you can separate various colors and patterns into different tanks.

, Most of the time, you will be able to tell that a live-breeder female is pregnant because its belly will swell. Sometimes, you will also see a black mark (called a gravid spot) on the side of the fish if it is pregnant.Don’t be surprised if some of your fish are already pregnant when you bring them home, or if they mate very quickly.

, Newborn fish (fry) are at risk of being eaten by other fish. To prevent this from happening, place a pregnant female in a special birthing tank shortly before she gives birth. This can be a smaller tank (5-20 gallons), but it should have all of the features of a regular tank.Put some plants and other objects in the birthing tank. The female will be able to hide behind these and feel safe enough to give birth.
Remove the female from the tank after the fry are born.
You can place the fry in a net that sits in the regular tank after they are born so that they are kept safe. Look for one at your pet store.
Birthing enclosures are also available. These are clear boxes that clip inside the birthing tank. They have small slits in them that the fry can escape through after birth.

, The exact amount of time it takes for live breeders to give birth varies based on species. The gestation period ranges from about 28 days for guppies to about 48 days for mollies.Just before she gives birth, a female may rub her abdomen back and forth on a plant in the aquarium.
The number of fry a live breeder will produce varies based on species, the age of the fish, and other factors. It can range from just a few to well over 100.
Live breeder females can store sperm, producing several groups of fry after mating just once.

, Live breeders can be fed a regular diet of fish flakes, available at your pet store. You can also supplement with dried blood worms, flies, or other treats. Most fry will begin eating regular food right away, although you can buy specially marked fry food if you want. This is formulated to encourage growth., Once fry have grown larger than the mouths of adult fish, they can be moved out of the birthing tank into a regular one. If you have a large number of fish, you will need to separate them out into multiple tanks to prevent overcrowding.Talk to a pet store or consult a species guide if you aren’t sure how many of your type of live breeder can be housed per tank.

, Live breeders produce fry frequently, and in large numbers. This means you can quickly become overrun with more fish than you can handle. Pet stores are not usually interested in buying fish from you, since there is such a huge supply, but you could ask. You could also try to give fish away to other people looking for a pet."

Keep trying!",How to Train Your Betta Fish," Although it might surprise you, betta fish can recognize you. They actually can become attached to their owners. If you spend time near your fish, she is more likely to recognize you. This will help in training. If you have just acquired your betta, give it at least a week to recognize you. You will know that your betta is ready if he or she starts swimming towards you if he/she sees you. , Make sure your fish’s color is bright and clear. Her fins should have no tears or holes. The scales should be smooth. Your fish should not move in a sluggish manner. Instead, she should swim quickly. Bubbles on the water’s surface are a good sign that your betta is doing well.If you want to train your betta, she needs to be in top condition.

, Purchase snacks like freeze-dried bloodworms for your pet. These are good training treats because they are breakable and small. Betta also eat tubifex worms, mosquito larvae, and daphnia (small crustaceans).While treats and food are great for training, overfeeding your betta is dangerous. A full-grown adult male betta should eat maximally two to three pellets or three to four bloodworms per feeding. He should be fed twice daily.If your fish's body is swollen, cutback feeding. She could be constipated. You can detect constipation by looking at the fish's digestive area from the side. If it is swollen, she likely is constipated. You also might notice a lack of defecation. If this happens, do not feed her for two days. Then feed her a piece of the inside of a pea (not the skin). The piece should be the size of her eyeball.Be sure to thaw frozen food before use., Before you work with your fish or are near her tank, wash your hands. Use hot water but do not use soap. Soap can be toxic for fish. When you finish a training session, wash your hands with soap.

, Softly tap on the glass and see if she looks at your hand. If not, give her half a worm or a treat to get her attention. Once she focuses on your hand and her gills move quickly, you can begin training.


Do not tap very hard or hit the tank repeatedly. You will shock your fish.

, Drag your finger across the front of the fish tank or bowl. If she moves towards it, reward her quickly with a treat. If she does not notice you, shake your finger until she notices.Move your finger in multiple directions. First, move your finger to opposite sides of the tank. Next, move your finger vertically up and down. Reward your fish each time she follows you.Train her for three to five minutes at a time over several days. Proceed to other tricks once she consistently follows your finger.Once your betta can follow your finger, teaching other tricks will be easier., When a male betta sees another male in nature, he flares.Flaring consists of a betta stretching her fins and opening her gills as much as she can. Bettas then look twice their size.You can teach your male or female fish to do this pretty trick. Flaring provides exercise, prevents boredom, and promotes bubble nest building. Bubble nest building consists of male bettas methodically blowing small bubbles in clusters on the water's surface.Only perform the flare trick three to five minutes a day or you can overexert your betta.Follow these steps:


Gather a small mirror and a red or black-capped pen. Use the same colored pen throughout training so your betta will recognize the pen.
Place the mirror in front of the tank.
Once your betta flares, place the pen next to the mirror.
Repeat this process two to three more times.
Once your betta instantly starts to flare, remove the mirror and leave only the pen.
Give your betta food or a treat each time she flares.
Continue until your betta flares each time you show the pen., Jumping is a natural habit for betta fish. To train your betta, use a feeding stick and place half a bloodworm on it. The food should be within reach of the fish. Starting with the stick underwater, have your betta come to you. With the next try, move the feeding stick closer to the water’s surface. Have your betta swim to you. Then move the stick to the water’s surface. Your betta should swim to you. Lastly, move your stick slightly above the water surface. Once your betta recognizes that she can get food from the stick, she will jump for it even if the stick is out of the water. After she nails the trick, you can substitute your fingers for the stick.By halving your bloodworms, you can avoid over-feeding your betta. Remember, she should have a maximum of three to four bloodworms in one sitting.You can train your betta to recognize a feeding stick, a thin stick with a curved end for attaching food, during her normal feeding times.Bettas naturally jump when excited or scared. Purchase a lid for your fish tank to prevent your betta from jumping from the tank.She can still jump when you remove the lid to feed her.

, Gather a pipe cleaner. Bend the pipe cleaner into a circle with a two inch diameter. Hang it on the side of the fish tank. The hoop should be perpendicular to the side of the aquarium and touching it. Move your finger along the outside of the tank in one direction through the hoop. Each time she swims through the hoop, give her a treat. Repeat this process until she regularly swims through the hoop. Gradually decrease the hoop size until it is slightly larger than one inch in diameter. After she is comfortable with the trick, move the hoop farther away from the tank’s sides. Continue until she can swim through the hoop while you hold it in the center of the tank.This is one of the most difficult tricks so do not be discouraged if it takes a while.
Be sure that your pipe cleaner is brand new and does not contain toxins that could harm your fish.

, Your betta will eventually figure out that if she does what you ask, you will reward her. Do a training session once per day. Be persistent.Do not overwork your betta, though. Make sure she has sufficient time to rest and relax.

Check your betta's size.,
Check your betta's fins.,
Assess the color of your betta.",How to Tell How Old a Betta Fish Is1," Normal adult bettas are usually around 3 inches (7.6 cm) in length. Hold a measuring tape up to your fishes' bowl and see how long it is. If your betta is less than the average, your betta is most likely a juvenile.It can be hard to measure a betta exactly. In most cases, you will be enough to simply get an estimate by holding up a measuring tape next to your fishes' bowl.;
, Adult bettas have nice and beautiful flowing fins. If your betta has this characteristic, this is a good sign that it is an adult. If it has tiny fins, then it is either a juvenile or a baby.Older betta's fins have typically undergone lots of wear and tear. They may have tiny tears or shredded ends.
Make sure you know the sex of your betta. Female bettas never get long, flowing fins like the males do.
Don't confuse normal wear with injuries from diseases.

, In general, young bettas are vibrant and middle-aged bettas are slightly faded. The color of the scales of an older betta will be slightly faded and muted.


Bettas that are bred for pets come in a wide variety of colors. However, wild betta fish tend to be grey or dull colored, and only show flashes of color when fighting."

Start feeding your baby danios brine shrimp.,
Move your baby danios to a larger tank.",How to Breed Danios," Start the breeding process by making sure you can tell the difference between your male and female danios. Male danios are normally skinnier than their female counterparts, and their colours are usually more vibrant. If the females have started to produce roe (eggs), they’ll look chubbier.Once you’ve sexed your danios, place the males and females into separate tanks to prepare them for breeding.
If you’re having a hard time sexing your danios before they’ve been conditioned, you may need to feed them premium live food for a couple of days before you’ll be able to tell them apart. Once you can tell them apart, separate the males from the females.;
, While your male and female danios are in their own tanks, feed them high quality live food. Live foods for danios include daphnia, bloodworm, and mosquito larvae. You should be able to find live food at most aquarium stores. Continue this process for 1 to 2 weeks before attempting to breed your danios.If you are unable to obtain live food, you can use frozen food as an alternative.You should notice the female danios grow rounder as they’re being conditioned! This is a great indication that they’re developing a lot of roe and are ready to breed.

, After 1 to 2 weeks of conditioning, your adult danios will be ready to breed. In order to be prepared, setup your breeding tank during the first week of conditioning. Your breeding tank can be between 5 and 10 gallons and should contain a filter with an air stone (to help prevent the eggs from being sucked into the filter). If you use tap water for the tank, make sure to add a water dechlorinator to the water. Add a heater to the tank and keep the temperature between 72F and 82F.Choose between the marble method, the breeder net method, or the spawning mop method for the configuration of your breeding tank.
Once you know what configuration method you want to use, you’ll know how much water needs to be put in the tank.

, Once 1 to 2 weeks have passed, move your danios to the breeding tank you’ve setup. It is best to partner 2 males for every 1 female you move over. Normally danios will breed within 24 hours of being placed in the breeding tank. If they do not, leave them for another 24 hours. If 48 hours passes with no spawning, put your danios back in their separate conditioning tanks for a little longer, and continue to feed them live food. Try breeding the danios again in another week or so. Spawning simply means the female danios have laid eggs and the male danios have fertilized the eggs. Since you can’t tell if the eggs are fertilized, the best thing to do is watch for eggs at the bottom of the tank. Once you see eggs, you know your danios have spawned and you can move the adults back to their regular tanks.

, Once you see danio eggs in the breeding tank, remove the adult danios and put them back in their regular tanks. If you used a breeder net, removal will be very easy. If you used the marble or mop methods, you’ll need to use a fish net to capture the danios in order to move them.Since adult danios will always try to eat the eggs of their young, it is always a good idea to remove the adults from the tank with the eggs. The baby danios aren’t really safe from the adults until they’re all about the same size.
Once your baby danios have reached adult size, you can put the “sons” with the “fathers” and the “daughters” with the “mothers”. Although, for genetic purposes, you may want to keep track of the different generations if you are planning to breed them again.

, One method that will help protect danio eggs is to place a 2-inch layer of glass marbles at the bottom of a 5 to 10 gallon aquarium. Then fill the aquarium with water until it reaches about 1 inch above the marbles. This provides enough room for the adults to swim around, and a very short fall for the eggs to take to their safe place in the marbles.The eggs will then fall in between the marbles, where they’ll be safe from the adults.
These are not special marbles, just regular marbles you’d buy in a dollar store or toy store. Or, you can use glass “rocks” from a decorating store or Ikea that are normally used in flower arrangements or candle holders.
The upside to this arrangement is that it’s really easy to implement, as glass marbles are easy to find. The downside to this arrangement is that glass marbles have become expensive in recent years and this method may be more expensive then other methods. Another downside is that you have to “catch” the adults once they’ve bred, as they’re not contained in one area.

, Another method to help protect danio eggs and babies is to place a breeder net inside the breeding tank. A breeder net is basically a basket that can be attached to the rim of the tank. The mesh of the basket allows the eggs to fall through, into the main part of the tank, but the mesh keeps the adults from being able to get to the eggs. Once the breeder net is placed in the tank, fill the tank with water until the bottom 1 inch of the breeder net is under water.When looking for a breeder net, make sure it’s big enough to allow the danio eggs to fall through.
You can buy a breeder net in most pet stores and aquarium shops.
The upside to using a breeder net is that it’s really easy to put the adults in the net and take them out of the net. You won’t need to catch any of the adults in the main tank. The downside is that you have the find the right net for danios so the adults can’t get through the mesh, but the eggs can. You can easily overcome this downside by asking someone at the aquarium store for assistance.

, A spawning mop is a bunch of acrylic yarn knotted together to form a mop-like contraption. For a 10-gallon tank, you’ll need about 10 to 20 spawning mops. Place the spawning mops at the bottom of the tank and fill the tank with water that goes no further than a couple of inches above the top of the mops. The yarn will partially float in the water creating a protective area for the eggs, similar to sea weed.You can easily make your own spawning mops using the following instructions:

Cut pieces of acrylic yarn to ~2 feet in length.
Lay 2 dozen of these yarn pieces beside each other and fold the bunch in half, right in the middle.
You should now have ~48 strands of yarn hanging down. Put a knot in the top of the bunch, where you’ve folded it in half, to hold all the pieces together.


An upside to this method is that the spawning mops are homemade, usually with old materials you (or a friend or family member) has anyway, so you don’t have to spend money on anything new items. The downside is that you have to physically make each mop. Another downside is that you’ll eventually have to catch the adult danios when it’s time to move them out of the breeding tank.

, Adults will normally spawn within a day of being placed in the breeding tank. Depending on what method you use, you should be able to see the actual eggs so you know they’re done. Once the eggs have been fertilized, it normally takes about 1.5 to 2 days for the eggs to hatch., Even though the eggs hatch within 1.5 to 2 days after being fertilized, the fry that are born won’t start swimming around for another couple of days. Until they start to swim around, there’s no need to feed them. Putting food in the water before they’re all swimming around will only end up making your tank dirty.Danio fry are extremely small and transparent, making it very hard to see them. You’ll need to carefully observe the tank to make sure you see them swimming around.
Danio fry who are not free swimming usually attach themselves to the side of the tank to keep themselves in one place. They may be easier to see when they do this.

, Once the fry have started to move around the tank on their own, it’s time to start feeding them. Danios normally eat things like baby brine shrimp, but that food will be too big for fry. Instead, you can feed them a specialized powdered egglayer fish food or infusoria. Start by feeding the fry lightly several times a day.You can find this special fish food at some pet stores and any aquarium store. Ask the sales person if you are unable to locate it on your own.

, Once your baby danios have started to eat on their own, it’s a good idea to add a bio sponge filter to the tank and a few snails. The snails especially are great for cleaning up any uneaten food and keeping the tank clean., In order to encourage your baby danios to grow quickly, change between 10% and 25% of the water in the tank every day. You’ll want to remove water from the bottom of the tank and replace it with clean water at the same temperature.In order to have fresh water at the proper temperature available, you may need to setup a separate tank with a heater that is simply used as a reservoir for your breeding tank.
If you use tap water in your reservoir tank, be sure to add dechlorinator to the water before putting the water into the breeding tank.

, As the baby danios grow, you can start to introduce freshly hatched brine shrimp to their diet. They’ll normally start to eat the shrimp around a week to 10 days after being hatched. Start by giving them some brine shrimp once a day, but keep feeding them the powdered egglayer fish food twice a day.You can continue to introduce new foods to your baby danios as they grow. Some options for other foods to try are: frozen cyclops, chopped tubifex worms, and live daphnia.

, When your baby danios are able half an inch long, it’s time to move them to a bigger tank. The size of the “bigger” tank may depend on how many babies you have in the breeding tank. It is not unusual for 2 to 3 female danios to produce several hundred babies.Depending on how many females you put in the breeding tank, you may want to prepare this larger tank based on an estimate of the number of babies you’re expecting.
It normally takes danios 6 weeks to reach a size of 1 inch long.

Pay attention to changes in energy.,
Look for cataracts on the betta's eyes.",How to Tell How Old a Betta Fish Is2," You might notice that with every day, your betta seems to be getting paler or even with daily feeding your fish gets skinnier. These are signs of an aging betta.As a betta ages, its back may also begin to arch. An old betta's back is usually humped, while a younger betta's back is more straight.

, Your betta will flare with much less gusto than it used to when it get old. After so many years, many bettas lose the enthusiasm to flare.

Also, while a healthy adult betta will swim around vigorously in it's tank, old bettas will hide behind plants and décor and swim sluggishly.
When feeding your betta, watch it to see how quickly it spots its food. Old bettas may swim slowly to their food and miss it a couple of times before spotting it.

, Old bettas tend to have ""cataracts,"" which are filmy or hazy spots covering the eye. This is normal for old bettas, and will happen no matter how big the tank you have is or how clean you keep the water.


If the fishes' eyes are black and hard to see, that is a sign of a healthy adult betta."

Avoid locations that will affect the temperature of the water, like near a heater, radiator, or cooling unit.
Avoid locations where frequent vibrations with affect the fish, such as near frequently opening and closing doors or in high foot-traffic areas.
Don’t place your aquarium under a direct natural light source, like a skylight or window, because it can increase algae production and throw off the balance of the tank’s ecosystem.
Don't place your aquarium in a place where there could potentially be drafts, such as near windows and doors.;
, It’s nearly impossible to over-filter an aquarium, so err on the side of more rather than less filtration. There are three kinds of filtration, mechanical, biological, and chemical.


Mechanical filtration uses a pump to draw water through a sponge, which will trap debris. Mechanical filtration helps keep the tank water looking clean and clear, though most tropical fish don’t require crystal-clear water for their habitat, so the clear water is mostly for your benefit.Biological filtration also draws water through a sponge, but in this case the sponge contains bacteria that remove pollutants.
Chemical filtration uses a special filter media that removes chemical pollutants.
If you have a saltwater tank, you’ll also need a protein skimmer, a filtration device that removes dissolved organics from the water., The heater-stat is a combined heater and thermostat designed to function underwater. The thermostat can be set to a specific temperature and the heater will turn on if the water temperature dips below your setting.


The most important factor when choosing a heater-stat is appropriate wattage. Be sure to choose one with high enough wattage to warm the size of aquarium you own, but don’t buy one with so much wattage that it will overheat the tank. The general rule is five watts per gallon.

, Air pumps introduce bubbles into the water that will facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide that fish need to breathe.


Air pumps are typically optional, as most filtration systems introduce ample oxygen into the water. They can be useful, however, in tanks where large amounts of oxygen is used up by the environment, such as if your tank features a lot of vegetation.
Some people opt to use a water pump for the aesthetic value added by the floating bubbles.

, A tank light will typically be comprised of a starter unit and a tube, and while there are several different types of tank lighting available, fluorescent lighting is the most common choice for new freshwater tank owners. Some saltwater tanks will require more specific lighting setups, determined by the species of fish you have in the tank.


Fluorescent tubes are relatively inexpensive to run and don’t produce significant amounts of heat, making them well suited for use in aquariums.Different types of lighting are better suited to encouraging plant growth or enhancing the color of your fish, but generally a full-spectrum light will offer both pleasant lighting and lighting suitable for plants.

, Carefully select which environmental features (rocks, plants, ornaments) you include in your aquarium.


The environment must closely emulate the fish’s natural habitat or they will become stressed, sick, and will possibly even die.If you’re unsure of the proper environment for your fish, consult your local fish or aquarium store.
If you’re setting up a saltwater aquarium, it’s strongly recommended that you add live rock, which are pieces of coral reef that naturally break or fall off. Live rock contains many live organisms necessary to a healthy tank ecosystem., Before introducing any fish to the aquarium, add water and let the pump/filtration system run for three days to a week, which will stabilize the environment and make it hospitable to your new fish.


Running the aquarium before putting in any fish is also important because it allows any harmful impurities to dissolve.

, Introduce good bacteria to the aquarium water with a cycling-aid product, which you can buy from a pet or fish retailer.


Good bacteria are a necessary and integral part of your aquarium’s environment. Without them, the delicate ecosystem fish need to survive won’t be able to establish itself.

, When choosing the first few fish you plan to introduce to your aquarium, seek out hardier types. Certain types of fish are better able to survive in an environment with high levels of ammonia and nitrites, which your aquarium will likely have at this point.


More resilient fish include danios, gouramis, and livebearers.
Don’t add more vulnerable types of fish to this initial tank environment as they likely won’t survive.
Ask an employee at the store from which you plan to purchase the fish to help you choose types of fish best suited to a brand-new aquarium.
Avoid overcrowding the aquarium. Don’t add more than three fish per week to the tank or you can raise the ammonia in the environment to toxic levels that can kill your fish.

, As you gradually begin to populate your aquarium, choose your fish very carefully. There are hundreds of kinds of tropical fish, and they don’t all live well together--some are aggressive, some are territorial, some are predatory, and so on. Make sure to choose types of fish that can live together in the tank and won’t fight or kill each other.Choosing the wrong fish not only subjects the fish to unnecessary suffering, it’s also something that’s easily avoidable with a little research.
Do your research and consult with an employee at a fish or aquarium retailer so that you know each of your fish’s needs. In addition to making sure your fish will get along, make sure they have compatible living-environment needs. If they all need different kinds of environments to thrive, your ecosystem won’t be able to accommodate those varied needs.
In addition to ensuring that your fish have similar habitat needs, be sure the fish also have similar temperature and pH needs., Don’t dump a new fish directly into the aquarium. Fish need to be able to regulate their temperature, and being put directly into new water can cause them significant distress.


Turn the tank light off so that the bright light won’t disturb the new fish.
For freshwater fish, float the plastic bag--still closed--in which you transported your new fish in the tank for about half an hour.
Open the bag, put some of the tank water in, and let it sit for at least 15 minutes.
Gently net the fish out.
Remove the bag once the fish has been removed.
Leave the tank light off for another few hours or for the rest of the day.
For saltwater fish, you must first quarantine your new fish in a separate tank before introducing it to your aquarium.

, This isn’t necessarily as simple as it sounds. Initially, feed your fish once a day when first setting up the tank, and once your aquarium is well established, you can begin feeding your fish according to the “little and often” rule.


Saltwater fish, particularly if they’re wild-caught, may need to be gradually weaned onto aquarium food over a period of weeks.
Some fishkeepers recommend introducing a “rest day” once a week during which no feeding occurs. It’s believed this can benefit your fish's’ health and encourage them to actively look for food.Food is the main source of waste and pollutants in your tank, so it’s crucial you don’t introduce too much, as overfeeding is one of the main reasons aquarium fish die.Only feed your fish as much as they can consume in about 3-5 minutes and no more. Be sure to read the instructions on the fish food label.
If food is left floating on the surface or sinks to the bottom, you’re overfeeding.
There are three main types of fish food: food for bottom swimmers, middle swimmers, and top swimmers, so buy the correct type of food for the fish you own.
It’s generally recommended that you feed your fish a variety of high-quality frozen and pelleted food, and that you make sure to defrost frozen food before feeding., Test the water each day to be sure the water temperature is consistent and in the ideal range for the type of fish in the aquarium.


In general, the ideal temperature for freshwater tropical fish is between 74 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit (23-28 degrees Celsius).
For saltwater fish, the recommended temperature is usually between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24-27 degrees Celsius)., Every week, test the water hardness and alkalinity and the levels of ammonia, nitrates, nitrites, pH, and chlorine in your aquarium water. The ideal range of levels for freshwater fish are as follows:pH - 6.5 - 8.2
Chlorine - 0.0 mg/L
Ammonia - 0.0 - .25 mg/L
Nitrite - 0.0 - 0.5 mg/L
Nitrate - 0 - 40 mg/L
Hardness - 100 - 250 mg/L
Alkalinity - 120 - 300 mg/L
Saltwater fish have more specific requirements that will vary by species and that will require additional specialized water-testing kits. To find out the specific needs of your saltwater fish, consult with a fish or aquarium retailer. In general, most saltwater fish need the following:
Specific gravity: 1.020 - 1.024 mg/L
pH: 8.0 - 8.4

Water testing kits are available from most pet and aquarium retailers.
If any of the levels are elevated, remove and replace some of the water until the levels are closer to where they need to be.
If the water ever looks cloudy or dirty, replace some of the water and check that your water filter is working properly.
For freshwater tanks, remove 10% of the water from the aquarium and replace it with the same amount of dechlorinated water every week. Make sure to add water that’s the same temperature as the water already in the tank or you could cause a temperature fluctuation that will be a stress on your fish.
Once a month, remove 25% of the aquarium water and replace it with dechlorinated water. Be careful that the water is the same temperature as that already in the tank or you can cause your fish distress.
For saltwater tanks, remove 20% of the water once a month, or about 5% per week. Be sure not to add freshly mixed saltwater directly to the tank; instead, prepare the saltwater mix at least one day before., Every week, clean the inside tank walls and remove any algae buildup.


Choose an acrylic- or glass-specific cleaning pad (according to the material used for your tank’s walls) to avoid scratching the surface.If you have an overabundance of algae, it’s typically a sign that something in your aquarium’s environment isn’t balanced. Test the water levels, be sure you haven’t added too many fish, verify that you aren’t overfeeding, check that the tank isn’t exposed to excessive natural light, etc., Every month, perform complete water-filter maintenance.


Your water filtration system is vital to the maintenance of your aquarium because it removes floating debris and contaminants from the water while neutralizing ammonia and nitrites.
Check the filter media (also called the filter floss). If needed, rinse it in some of the discarded tank water. Don’t rinse with tap or other water because it will upset the balance of good bacteria and possibly even kill them off.Replace the carbon, filter cartridge, and pre-rinse filter.

, Change the air stone (helps with the water pump’s efficiency and longevity) every month.


Clean the pump’s impeller assembly at least once a year.

, If you have live plants in your aquarium, prune them back once a month to prevent them from overgrowing.


Also be sure to remove any brown or decaying leaves from your aquarium’s plants.

Make sure the tank is covered.",How to Teach Your Betta to Jump," That is, don't start teaching your fish to jump the first day you get it. Let it come to associate you with feeding it, so it learns to trust you somewhat. When the fish doesn't look scared when you're around and when it immediately pops up to the top of the tank when you want to feed it, it's likely getting used to you.Try to wait a couple of weeks before attempting to train it. A month may be better because it will give your betta a chance to get used to the tank and to you.;
, Spend some time watching your fish and observing its behavior. Getting to know what your fish likes to do can help you train it. For instance, you can teach most fish to jump, but you may also be able to teach it other tricks based on what it likes to do, such as teaching one that likes to go through hoops how to swim through a hoop on command., When you're trying to train, minimize other distractions. Have other people leave the room, and turn off any noise. You want the fish to focus on you and what you're doing, not what else is going on in the room., Though most fish will eat anytime you provide food, it's still a good idea to wait until your fish is hungry to try to train it. That way, when you use food to bribe or reward the fish, it will respond to it more readily than if you had just fed it., Place a piece of food on the end of your finger to use as an incentive. You can wet your finger a little bit, so the piece of food will stick to the end. The food is what will get the fish to jump, as most fish will not jump just for a finger or something interesting.You can also use a popsicle stick or a straw in place of your finger. The betta won't hurt you, but you will be getting up close and personal with the fish.

, Place your finger (or stick or straw) above the water. You don't want to get too high. Just place it an inch or so above the water. In fact, when you're first starting out, you may want to put it just above the surface of the water so your betta gets used to the idea gradually.Be careful to stay just above the water. Otherwise, the food will float off your finger, straw, or stick.
Also, try not to make your finger too high, as the betta could jump out of the water. In addition, make sure you do it in the center of the tank, so there's less risk of the betta jumping out.

, Now it's time to wait for the betta to do its thing. It should swim to the top and jump to get the food off your finger.If it needs a little encouragement, sprinkle a flake or two of food on top of the water just below your finger, so it comes to the right area.


Hold still while waiting for the betta. Movement can scare the betta fish.
If your betta looks agitated or scared, try again later.

, If your betta doesn't get the idea the first time you do it, keep working on the trick. Try holding the food on your fingers a couple times every day to see if you can eventually entice your betta to come take the food by jumping up.Only do it once or twice each time you try it because the betta has a small stomach, about the size of its eyeball., Once your betta figures out that it can jump for food, it will likely jump just for your finger, the straw, or the popsicle stick you used. Practice for a few weeks with food, and then you can try taking away the food to see if it will jump without it. If the betta jumps, reward it with food. Eventually, the betta may not even need the reward.


You may need to stick with using food as a bribe, though, depending on your fish.

, If you can't get your fish to take the food from your finger, make sure to go ahead and feed it. It's abusive to withhold food to get your fish to do a trick. You can always try again later with the trick., Because fish will practice the tricks you teach them when you're not around, you need to make sure your tank is covered (with holes for aeration). Otherwise, your fish may jump out of the tank or into another part of the tank if you have barriers. If it jumps out, the fish could die."

Keep trying, waiting for and encouraging the fish to swim through.,
Remove the hoop object when you're finished.,
Try again regularly.",How to Teach Your Betta Fish to Swim Through a Hoop," Use a small hoop, earring, rubber band or hair band to create a hoop. Use something that is clean; don't introduce bacteria or dirt to the tank. You can hold the hoop in the tank if wished but it's much easier to tie a thread or filament around the hoop object, then attach it to a piece of balsa wood, ruler or similar item that you can then run across the top of the tank and leave dangling in place. That way, you don't have to get your hands wet and can concentrate on encouraging the fish to swim through the hoop instead.


Another alternative is to make a loop using a pipe cleaner and hang the non-looped end over the edge of the tank. However, this will need to be held by hand when you start moving the hoop inward, or you can tie it the ruler/wood, etc., if it's long enough.;
, Do this gently and with care. You're starting at the side because it's easier for you to interact with the fish at the edge to begin with. As the fish becomes more accomplished at going through the hoop, you can move the hoop more towards the middle until eventually it is only placed in the middle of the tank.

, Splash the water or call the fish to try to attract it.

,


Tap at the glass and move your finger in the direction of the hoop to try to persuade the fish to swim toward the hoop.
Offer rewards for a job well done. Drop a few flakes or a tiny fish treat after each successful swim through the hoop––while there's no guarantee the betta will associate the reward with swimming through the hoop object, it's worth a try to the fish may just click over time. Don't overfeed it though.

, Repeat the actions from the previous step for up to 20 minutes at a time.

, Do not leave it in the tank unattended in case the fish gets caught up in it or the string.

, The more familiarity your betta has with the hoop object, the greater the chance it will find it fun to swim through and repeat the experience each time that you add the hoop object. Keep moving the hoop after the fish successfully masters it in the initial placement, until eventually you can place the hoop in the center of the tank and the fish happily swims through.


Keep up the treats. If the treats are associated with the hoop, you must continue with them for good performance until the betta goes through the hoop without encouragement.

This can help ensure the quality and success rate of your betta spawn.Be aware that getting quality bettas to breed can be expensive. More expensive fish generally mean that a breeder has also used selective breeding techniques. Although this isn’t a guarantee of successful breeding, it can ensure the health and quality of your fish and possible their spawn.
Some elements to look for in a breeder include: accomplishments, longevity, experience, knowledge, professionalism, affiliation with betta organizations, availability, reputation, track record, cleanliness, reference.Ask the breeder to let you know about the parentage of the bettas. If he can’t answer the question, you may want to consider using another breeder than keeps tabs of his bettas’ parentage.
Find quality betta breeders through organizations such as the International Betta Congress.If you have friends or family that breed bettas or are familiar with them, you might ask them for suggestions, too.;
, Figure out which bettas to get depending on what qualities you’re hoping to highlight or breed out. You want to get the best quality stock you can afford and finding the right pair can help ensure health, beauty, and even your enjoyment.Be aware that selective breeding is meant to bring out certain characteristics in a betta fish. For example, you may want to bring out black lace patterns in your betta. By choosing another betta with more distinctive lace patterns and mating it with your betta, you can bring out this particularly quality. You can apply this principle to color and fin size, too.
Remember that if you’re hoping to achieve a certain goal through your selective breeding, either with fin size or color, it can take a few years and cycles for these traits to fully appear., Betta breeding can be rough no matter what, but it’s important to get fish that are approximately the same size. This helps prevent injury to one of the fish. Looking at the size of each betta can ensure healthy spawn and a healthy breeding process for each fish.Be aware that a fish that is too small may be too young to breed. Aim to breed bettas that are 3-4 months old, which can help ensure that the sizes are proportionate as well as help prevent bad quality spawn.
Detect sexual maturity in your betta by looking for males that build bubble nests and females that have a rounded belly and whitish breeding tube., Many people want to selectively breed their bettas for fin size and finnage. Looking at the fins for characteristics you want to bring out as well as for potential injury can help ensure that you get the qualities you hope to breed.


Check the caudal, or tail, fin for straightness and curvature. Good breeding stock bettas with have straighter caudal fins that are curved in opposite directions. Avoid bettas with caudal fins curved in the same direction.
Look for ray branching or splitting on all of the bettas fins. The more branches or splits you have, the more supportive, larger, and beautiful finnage you will get.Make sure the betta has no traces of fin rot, which looks like ripped or fuzzy fins with red tips or near the tears., Bettas come in and exhibit a wide range of colors on their bodies. Find the color bettas you like as mates or for your betta as a mate and try to choose colors that work well together.


Be aware that bettas come in colors such as red, orange, yellow, turquoise, steel blue or royal blue. They can also have black or iridescent features. For example, you might find that breeding the blues with black lace features give your fish beautiful colors.Ask the breeder if you are unsure of what can work best for your betta.

, You can breed your bettas in smaller tanks, but it’s best for the fish to mate in a tank that is at least a 5-10 gallon. This ensures the delicate female has enough space and can make the mating process more optimal for both bettas.Remember that your bettas need separate tanks until it is time for them to breed. This keeps the fish from harming one another.

, Water quality is vital to the health and happiness of any betta. This is especially true during mating, so make sure that your tank water is as fresh and high quality as possible.Test the fish tank water with a test kit you can buy at most pet stores. Use the test to find potential problems with water quality, such as high ammonia, acidity or low pH, or low oxygen.Fix any problems in the water. The pH level should be about 7. If it isn’t, get a chemical neutralizer at your local pet store to restore the levels back to 7. Oxygen saturation should exceed 70%.If it doesn’t you may need to clean out the tank and fill it with new water or replace the charcoal filter.
Make sure the water temperature it is between 50 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit with a thermometer. This can help promote breeding between your bettas and ensure quality spawn., Bettas produce a lot of waste, which can effect water quality. Filter the water gently, which can maintain the health of your mating bettas, promote the mating process and help the eggs and fry survive.Watch for too much movement of the water by the filter. The natural habitat of bettas is still water, and anything that moves particularly roughly water may disturb bettas and their offspring., Mating causes female bettas stress and can injure them.Hiding spots made out of plants can soothe the female and guard the bubble nest of eggs.


Arrange an array of floating plants in the tank to optimize your bettas’ breeding space. You can use live or artificial plants in the tank, all of which are available at pet stores or specialty fish retailers.

, If either betta is showing signs of illness, consider giving it commercial fish medication. This can treat your fish for diseases or parasites and aid breeding., Breeding can stress and fatigue your betta pair. Feed them a hearty diet before they start breeding to optimize the process and ensure the health of the eggs and fry.Give the pair a mixture of live brine shrimp and flake food. Feed them once per day to prevent excess food from spoiling the water., Once you have checked the health of and fed each betta, it’s time for them to “meet.” Keep the bettas in separate tanks for a few days to help the pair acquaint themselves, prevent injury, and ensure higher quality eggs.Place the male and female in separate tanks close to one another for a day or two. You may notice the bettas showing interest in one another during this time, which is a sign they’re ready to mate.

, Move the male to the breeding tank once the bettas have had a chance to get acquainted in separate tanks. Keep the female in her tank for a few hours so that the male can prepare himself to breed.Check that the male isn’t exhibiting any signs of distress before adding the female to the water. Bettas show stress by banging their bodies up against the sides of the tank or swimming near the surface.

, Once the male is safely in the breeding tank for a few hours, you can slowly introduce the female to the tank. Giving her an initial separate space within the tank helps her acclimate and can prevent the male from stressing her before she is ready.


Protect the female in the breeding tank with a hurricane glass or cut a Styrofoam cup in half. Gently lower this separate container into the tank and place it up against one of the tank walls. Avoid sealing the glass or cup flush against the wall, which can prevent her from swimming out to the male to breed. Give her enough space by which she can easily swim out.
Make sure the male can see the female's container, which may stimulate him to start building a bubble nest., Observe the bettas to discern if there is any interest between the pair such as fin fanning. This can not only help you figure out if the bettas need new mates, but also if the female is ready to release her eggs.Watch for flaring or fanning of the fins, which is a good sign of interest between the mating pair of bettas.
Be aware that it can take 4-5 for bettas to show interest in their mate.

, If your bettas show interest in one another, you may see the male create a bubble nest. This is a sign to release the female her separate enclosure within the breeding tank.Be aware that the male may release his bubble nest on the hurricane glass or Styrofoam cup and the female may lay her eggs before she is released from the hurricane glass or Styrofoam cup. This is normal and not a cause for worry.

, When your male betta creates his bubble nest, he may also try and attract the female with fin flaring. If she doesn’t move from her spot, put the female on top of the bubble nest to make sure she lays her eggs within the protective bubbles.Check to make sure the female is ready to release eggs. This is evident when she has vertical stripes on each side of her body.
Place the female on or near the bubble nest so she can lay eggs even if she released some eggs in her container.

, Once she’s laid her eggs, remove the female from the breeding tank. Put her back in her usual tank, which can prevent injury to her from the very devoted male betta.Be aware that a female may lie still for a few moments after laying her eggs. Male bettas may also chase females away from the bubble nest when they’re done laying eggs.
Put the female in her old tank or consider letting her rest for a few days in a hospital or holding tank.

, Bettas are easily injured in the mating process. Check for torn fins after they mate to prevent disease or death.Add a commercial water treatment such as MarOxy or Bettamax to prevent disease in recently bred bettas. Buy the water treatments at a pet stores or a specialty fish supplier.
Separate the fish if you notice significant stress or wounding.

, After about three days, check to see if the eggs have hatched. The fry, which have the appearance of little black dots, will also have little tails. Watching for the development of fry signals you to remove the male betta, which can maintain the safety and health of the fry.Put the male back in his tank or a hospital tank for a few days.
Feed the fry once they're swimming freely. Fry get “infusoria,” which is easily made by placing a lightly boiled potato in a jar of aquarium water for 2 days to culture the microscopic animals. Put some of the infusoria water in the tank with the fry 2 times a day.
Allow the fry to stay together for about 7 months. If you wait longer, they may start to fight and inure one another and flaring with one another.

, If you want to breed bettas that recently hatched, choose the best male and female from the spawn to continue breeding once the bettas are old enough.Consider selling the rest of the bettas, though you may want to keep the second best male and second best female as back up in case one pair doesn't work.
Keep track of the parentage of each new group as well as which bettas you plan to breed based on the traits you want to enhance.
Remember that by taking the best spawn from each generation of breeding, that you are one step closer to bringing out your chosen traits.

, Although you should inbreed as much as possible to get the traits you want, you will eventually need to start the process over again and introduce new genes. Purchase a new male or female betta that look similar to your line. Breed the individual with your fish and then continue to inbreed the new fry.


Get your new betta from a reputable breeder. Consider swapping your young betta for one of theirs as a form of payment. This can be beneficial to you and the other breeder.

, Inbreed bettas for six generations before introducing new genes. This can help bring out great coloring and finnage on your bettas’ generational lines.


Be aware that it can take years of breeding to get the exact color or finnage you want from your bettas. Remember to be patient and keep breeding.

This means that the classic fish bowl, nor the vases that pet stores commonly keep Bettas in are not large enough! The tank needs to be large enough to allow plenty of space for your Betta to move and explore, which is necessary to keep him healthy.Keep a lid on your Betta’s tank. Bettas will jump right out of their tank if you do not use a lid.
Make sure there’s a few inches of space between the surface of the tank’s water and the lid, as Bettas will sometimes surface for a bit of fresh air.;
, You need a filter to circulate, aerate, and filter the tank’s water. In particular, a filter will break down and remove toxic fish waste from the tank. You will likely need a filter with adjustable flow rate, as Bettas require a large tank with a low flow. This mimics the relatively still water in which the species evolved.Since there are many types of filters, it may seem hard to choose. Whichever filter you choose, make sure it is rated for your size of tank. This information will be on the filter’s packaging.
Keep the filter setting relatively low, to ensure that the filter is not creating any strong currents.

, Since Bettas are from a tropical climate, they require a relatively high water temperature. You’ll likely need to equip your tank with a heater, as normal room temperature and temperature fluctuations in human dwellings is too cold for Bettas. Ideally, get a submersible aquarium heater and keep it running to maintain the water temperature from 74–80 °F (23–27 °C).Equip your tank with a thermometer as well, to help ensure the water maintains an optimal temperature. Check the water temperature whenever you feed your fish.
Heat lamps, which are often built into tanks designed for tropical fish, are not adequate for Bettas. Submersible heaters allow for more consistent temperatures, which Bettas require.

, Place your tank on a stable, solid surface that can safely hold its weight. Make sure that direct sunlight does not hit the tank at any point of the day. Sunlight contributes to excessive algae growth and dangerously high temperatures.If you’ve equipped your tank with lights, keep them off for at least 12 hours a day. Not only will this help control algal growth, it is important to provide your fish with a chance to rest.

, In addition to ample space, Bettas also require plenty of plants and/or other decorations. This will provide places to find cover, rest, explore, and hide when frightened. It will also simply ensure that your Betta is adequately stimulated by its environment. A Betta that enjoys and feels comfortable in its environment will be more active and interesting to watch!Artificial plants may be preferable, as natural plants will cause your tank water to become dirty much more quickly.
Include at least one tall artificial plant that has leaves large enough to support your Betta near the surface of the water, so that they can rest near the surface where the water is especially rich in oxygen.
When selecting artificial plants and other decorations, make sure there are no sharp edges that might tear or catch your Betta’s fins.
Do not keep mirrors in or near a Betta’s tank, as a male Betta will continually attack their own reflection.

, Substrate is an important component of a healthy fish tank, as it allows for the development of healthy bacteria. Your tank’s filter works with the help of this bacteria, which collects in a tanks substrate and also develops on the filter’s internal materials. These bacteria convert ammonia that is produced by decomposing fish waste into nitrates.The best type of substrate for a Betta tank is stone gravel, polished or otherwise smoothed. Get gravel from a pet store or online.
The individual pieces of gravel should be too large for your Betta to fit in its mouth.

, You can get a water conditioner from a pet store or online. This will remove chemicals from tap water that are harmful to fish, including chlorine and chloramine. Ultimately, you’re shooting for a ph around 7.0, which you should test for weekly. Testing kits can also be purchased at pet supplies stores or online.You may also need to add supplements to the tank if your water’s “hardness” needs to be adjusted. Test kits will also help you test for “general hardness” and “carbonate hardness”. Shoot for 7-9 degrees and 5-8 degrees hardness, respectively.
In addition to pH, GH, and KH, you should also test for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate. If any of these later three amounts are off, you can get liquid acids or buffers to help adjust their levels.

, Plan to change about 25%-30% of the tank’s water every other week. Use a gravel vacuum to suck waste and uneaten food from the tank’s substrate. During your weekly cleaning, remove the tank’s decorations and rinse them off. Whenever the walls of the tank are becoming visibly dirty, wipe them off with a sponge designed for cleaning fish tanks.A gravel vacuum is actually a simple siphon you can get from your pet store or online.
Siphon about a third of the tanks water from the bottom of the tank. This will allow waste to be pulled from the gravel without removing the gravel.
Replace the same amount of water you removed with dechlorinated water that’s the same temperature as the water in the tank.
Do not change all of the water at once, so the tank maintains a healthy amount of the bacteria that helps your filter keep the tank conditioned.

, Bettas are meat eaters, so they must be food that is high in protein content. There are plenty of options, and you should actually vary the type of food your feed your fish, as long as you stick to high-protein options. Be especially careful not to feed your Betta too much, as leftover food can lead to a higher likelihood of your fish developing a disease related to dirty water.Feed your Betta an amount of food they can within two minutes. Monitor your Betta while eating. If there’s food left after two minutes, feed them less next time.
Start by feeding them just a pinch at a time, adding more if two minutes have not elapsed and they're still eating.
Stick to one feeding per day.

, There are certain symptoms you should watch out for, as they may indicate that your Betta is sick. Behaviorally, be on the lookout for unusual swimming patterns, a sudden loss of appetite, or your betta scraping their body against the gravel in its tank. In terms of appearance, watch out for abdominal swelling, fins that are clamped against the sides of your Betta’s body, or any inflammation or discoloration.If you observe any of these symptoms, change the tank water immediately and begin more closely testing the water quality. Make sure water temperatures are safe as well.

, Never keep two male Bettas in the same tank. You can, however, add a female Betta to your tank. Make sure a tank that houses two Bettas is at least 10 gallons (38 l; 8.3 imp gal). This will allow both of your fish to establish territories, and reduce stress and aggression. Further, make sure there are good places for the female fish to hide."

Clean the tank regularly.",How to Set Up a Betta Tank," You may see betta fish housed in tiny plastic bowls in stores, but bettas actually need more space to thrive. For a happy, healthy, and stress free betta, choose a glass or clear acrylic tank that holds at least 2.5 gallons of water, but bigger, typically 5 gallons, is recommended. Bettas can jump, so make sure the tank has a lid. This will give the betta plenty of room to swim, and the water won't become contaminated as quickly as it would in a smaller tank.


It is possible to keep bettas in smaller tanks or jars, but they require at least a weekly cleaning and water change. If you want to house your betta in a smaller tank, choose one that holds at least 2.5 gallons of water; any less, and the betta will be likely to get sick.
Bettas cannot live with other bettas. This is always true for males, and it's usually true for females, too. Your best bet is to house each betta separately, so you'll need a tank for each betta you want to own.;
, Bettas naturally live in streams with a gentle current. Their long, flowing fins make it difficult for them to fight stronger currents, so it's important to choose a filter that is labeled ""gentle"" or comes with adjustable settings. Choose a filter that is designed to fit with the tank size and type of you have chosen.If you have a stronger filter, it is possible to create current buffers using plants. However, it is advisable to get a gentle filter instead, so you fish won't have to expend energy straining against the current.
Betta fish can survive in unfiltered water, but you will have to clean the tank frequently to remove their waste and uneaten food. Leaving the tank to get murky is unhealthy for betta fish.

, Betta fish are tropical, and they do best in water that stays between 74 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Choose a water heater that comes with a thermostat so you can monitor the temperature of the tank water.If you live in a place where the climate is warm enough to keep the water temperature high, you don't need a water heater; however, it's important to make sure the water temperature never drops below 74 degrees Fahrenheit.
If you have chosen to use a tank smaller than five gallons, it can be dangerous to use a water heater, as the tank can overheat. This is another good reason to get a sizable tank for your betta fish.

, Gravel is an important part of the tank environment. Beneficial bacteria grow on the surface of the gravel, helping to break down waste. Choose small gravel, rather than gravel made with larger pieces of rock. Food and waste can get caught among the larger rocks and hurt the health of the tank.


If you are using live plants in your tank, you will need two inches of gravel so the plants can root. If you are using fake plants (silk plants only), one inch is sufficient.
Choose gravel in natural-looking blues, greens and browns to line your tank. Brighter colors like pink and orange will make the environment feel less natural for your bettas.

, Live plants help to clean the water and provide a natural environment for your betta. If you want to include live plants, choose plants that grow well in the conditions of the tank, taking the temperature, current and substrate type into account.


Remember that the gravel should be at least two inches deep to support live plants. Using real plants creates a more natural micro-ecosystem in the tank, with the plants filtering out waste for fertilizer and adding oxygen to the water as they ""breathe"". Willow Leaf Hygro, Ruffled Sword, and Brazilian Pennyroyal all do well in freshwater tanks.
If you want to use fake plants, make sure they're silk and do not have sharp edges. Bettas' long, fragile fins can be injured when they swim near the plants.
Choose other decorations to keep your betta happy. Structures that allow them to hide, such as caves or tunnels, are excellent choices for ensuring that your fish feels safe and secure in its home. Be sure that the decorations you choose do not have ANY sharp edges or rough surfaces that could snag your betta's fins. Use fine grit sandpaper or an emery board to smooth down troublesome spots.

, Choose a spot that is near a window, but not exposed to direct sunlight. Be sure to set the tank on a very sturdy surface so that it isn't likely to topple. Finally, if you have other pets, you may want to consider placing the betta in a room they don't have access to.


You may want to get an aquarium stand designed to hold the weight of the tank you have chosen.
Allow five inches between the aquarium and the wall to accommodate the filter and heater., Different types of filters require different installation methods. Check the manufacturer's instructions for the filter you purchased and make sure it is installed properly.


If you have an external power filter, set it up on the back of the tank. Your tank lid may have come with a cut-out to make installation easier. Wait until the tank is filled with water before turning it on.
If you have an undergravel filter, put the filter plate in first and make sure the tubes are correctly fitted. Don't turn it on until the tank has been filled with water.

, Rinse the gravel thoroughly under cool running water (no soap) to remove all traces of dust, which can clog the filter. Pile one to three inches of gravel into the tank. Slope it gently toward the back of the tank. Place a clean plate on top of the gravel and begin pouring water on top of the plate to fill the tank. The plate will prevent you from displacing the gravel as you pour the water. Continue until the tank is one-third full.As you add water, check the tank for leaks. If you see a leak, it's important to repair it before you finish filling and stocking the tank.
Remove the plate when you're finished adding water.

, For live plants, make sure the roots are properly buried beneath the surface of the gravel. Arrange the plants so that the taller plants are in the back of the tank and the shorter plants are near the front. This will give you a better view of your betta.


Make sure all decorations are properly anchored in the gravel, so they won't come loose.
After you finish filling your tank, it's best not to put your hands in the water again, so make sure you like the positioning of your plants and decorations.

, Fill the tank within an inch of the top with water, then plug in the filter and turn it on to make sure it works properly. Check to make sure the water is circulating, gently, smoothly and quietly. Adjust the settings if it seems to be moving too powerfully.

, Most heaters attach to the inside of the tank with suction cups. Position the heater near the mouth of the filter, to ensure that the water gets evenly heated. Plug in the heater and install the thermometer so you can begin monitoring the temperature.


Adjust the heater so that the temperature rises to between 78 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
If you have a tank light, turn it on to see whether it affects the temperature of the tank. If the light seems to drastically affect the temperature, you'll need to get a better light before you introduce fish to the tank.

, Neutralizer is a dechlorinator that removes chlorine from the water. It's necessary to add this if you filled your tank with tap water that contains chlorine. Add the amount of neutralizer instructed for the amount of water in your tank.


If you used distilled water, which does not contain chlorine, you may skip this step.
You may also want to add a dose of SafeStart, which is a bacterial catalyst that will help promote a healthy environment in the tank.

, Doing a fishless cycle gives the tank time to build up a beneficial bacteria population. If you don't do a fishless cycle, your fish can be ""shocked"" by the water and die, so don't skip this step. See How to Do a Fishless Cyle to learn exactly how to cycle your tank to meet your betta's needs. You will need to use a water testing kit to monitor the water pH, ammonia and nitrate to make sure the levels are safe for your fish.


The ideal pH is 7. Ammonia and nitrate should be at 0 before you add fish.
You may need to add ammonia remover to bring down the ammonia level.

, It's best not to actually bring a fish home until your tank is set up, cycled and ready to go. That way you'll be able to help the betta make the transition to its new home as soon as possible. Go to the pet store and choose a new betta to bring home. Remember, every betta needs its own tank; even females.


Look for a healthy betta with a brightly-colored body and undamaged fins.
If a betta seems to be floating aimlessly, it may be sick. Choose a one that swims strongly.

, Place the bagged betta in the tank for an hour. Keep the bag closed and set the bagged betta into the tank so that the water inside the bag comes to the same temperature as the tank water. This will prevent the betta from getting a temperature shock when it enters the tank. After about one hour, it's time to release the fish. Open the bag and let the fish swim freely into the tank. From now on, care for the betta as follows:


Feed the betta once a day. Only get food that has been approved for bettas.
Do not overfeed, or the betta tank will become contaminated with old food and waste.

, If you have a filtered betta tank, you will need to change out 20 percent of the tank water every week to maintain a healthy tank. If you have an unfiltered bowl, you will need to change out 50 percent of the water to keep the tank clean enough for your betta. To change the water,


Prepare the amount of new water you need by filling a clean container the day before and letting it come to room temperature overnight. Add water conditioner if you're using tap water. Distilled water also works well.
Siphon some of the old water into a clean bowl. Net your betta and place it in the old water.
Siphon out the amount of water you need to change, according to the size and type of your tank.
Pour in the fresh water. Add a little fresh water to the bowl with the betta to help it get used to the new water.
After a few hours, reintroduce your betta to the tank.

, Your cleaning method will depend on the type and size of your chosen tank. A filtered tank should be cleaned once every couple of weeks, while an unfiltered tank should be cleaned once a week. Vacuum the gravel to remove chunks of food and waste. Vacuum the sides of the tank to clean the glass or acrylic. Scrub any decorations that have collected waste and debris.


This can be done each time you add new water to the tank, or less often if you're using a filtered tank.
Use your good sense to determine whether a thorough tank cleaning is needed; if the tank looks filthy, it's time to clean, no matter when you did it last.
Monitor the pH, ammonia and nitrate levels as well, and make changes to the tank to alter the levels when necessary.

Add objects to the bottom of your Betta's tank.,
Try adding bobbing objects to the top of the tank.,
Feed your Betta live food occasionally.",How to Play With Your Betta Fish1," Betta are very curious fish and they are entertained by new things they can explore. They also like to have places to hide and places to relax in their tanks, so adding objects to their tanks is key to their happiness.


Either find items to put in the tank that are made to go in fish tanks or items that can be thoroughly cleaned, will not fall apart in water, and are non-toxic. If it's small enough and clean enough, you can put it in the Betta's tank!
There are a wide variety of products made for Betta tanks specifically. At the very least, consider adding a fake plant for your Betta to hide or relax in.While you do want to give you Betta places to hide and explore, you also need to give it enough open space to swim around freely. Don't overcrowd the tank with too much stuff!;
, Get a small floating toy or a fishing bobber. You don't want to cover the entire surface of the tank, as Betta come up to the surface to get air, but you can float a few fun toys for the Betta to play with.


Make sure the toy is clean before you place it in the water.
Put a small plastic ping-pong ball in the top of the tank.See what the betta does! Some Betta will push it around their tank. If the Betta doesn't play with the ball immediately, give your fish some time to get used to it.

, This is a great way to entertain your fish. Fish or Aquarium specific stores often offer live worms that most Betta will chase with zeal.


Always feed your Betta a balanced, varied diet. Too many treats or meals will not be good for your fish but they can be given once in a while with no problem. You just don't want to feed them too much and get them sick!

Run your finger back and forth across your Betta's tank.,
Train the Betta to eat out of your fingers.,
Train your Betta to swim, and maybe even jump, through a hoop.,
Get your Betta to ""flare"" its fins by showing its reflection in a mirror.Show the Betta its reflection for a few seconds.",How to Play With Your Betta Fish2," See if your fish will follow your finger as you move it across the tank. In many cases, the Betta will follow along if it knows its caretaker (you).


Try to get your Betta to follow different patterns you make with your fingers. Can you get it to do a flip?

, When you feed your Betta, make sure that it comes up and sees that it's you feeding it. Once your Betta is used to you being near when it feeds, try keeping your hand above the water while it eats. Gradually you can transition to holding the food slightly under water between your thumb and forefinger.


Try feeding your Betta a food they really like while training them. Betta may even jump if you hold blood worms or insects above the water level just a bit!

, Make a hoop out of a pipe cleaner or a piece of plastic. Figure out what your Betta likes to eat most, and use that as bait. Hang the hoop in the tank so that the Betta can swim through it. Move the bait to encourage the betta to swim through the hoop.


As your Betta becomes more and more comfortable swimming through the hoop, raise it up little by little, until the bottom of the hoop is just touching the water's surface. With enough practice, your Betta may jump out of the water and through the hoop to get a food reward.
Remember not to overfeed your Betta fish. A few treats for training are just fine but don't overfeed the fish or it could cause illness or death.

, When it sees its reflection in the mirror the Betta will think there is another fish in the tank. Male Betta are very territorial, so when they see this imaginary other fish, they flare out their fins.


There is some debate about whether or not this is a good practice for Betta fish.

This can provide needed space for the female and help optimize the mating process., Maintaining water quality is essential to keeping your fish happy and healthy. It may also help provide the best environment for your bettas to mate.You can buy a fish tank water testing kit at most pet stores.These tests can help you identify any problems with the water, such as high ammonia.Test the temperature to make sure it is between 50 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit.Test the water for acidity. Most fish thrive at a neutral pH level of approximately 7.If the water is too acidic, you can buy a chemical neutralizer at most pet stores.Test for oxygenation to help ensure that the saturation exceeds 70%., Fish create a lot of waste and an important component of maintaining water quality for a protective environment is filtering it. This can not only help keep your bettas healthy, but may also aid the mating process and help the eggs and fry survive.Make sure the filter is gentle. Too much movement of the water can disturb bettas and their fry because their natural habitat has still water.Clean or replace the charcoal filter once a month., Female bettas need places to hide to relieve stress and avoid injury.Plants can also help protect the bubble nest of eggs. Arrange a selection of floating plants in your tank to help ensure an optimal and protected place for your bettas to breed.You can use either live or artificial plants in the tank.Purchase plants at pet stores or retailers that specifically deal with fish.

, You want to select the healthiest bettas to mate. Choosing the right pair can help ensure their health and continuation of quality breeding stock.The male and female should be roughly the same size to avoid one of them being injured.Healthy bettas are well-fed and don’t have any obvious diseases such as fin rot or anchor worms., It’s important to make sure your bettas are well fed before they start breeding. This will help optimize the breeding process and may help ensure the vitality of the eggs and fry.Feed bettas a mixture of live brine shrimp and flake food.Don’t overfeed your bettas. They only need feeding once per day and any excess food will fall to the bottom of the tank and can spoil the water., If your fish is showing signs of illness and you’re not sure what the cause is, use a commercial fish medication to treat any illness. This may help heal your fish from any diseases or parasites and could aid breeding.You can get commercial fish medication at most pet stores and even some larger retail stores.
Be aware that commercial fish medications are not regulated by government agencies, which means the treatments may be useless or could harm your fish. The best treatment is always being sure of the disease for which you’re treating., Once you are sure each betta is healthy and well fed, you can introduce the pair. It can take a few days for the bettas to get used to one another in separate tanks, but this may help prevent injuries and poor quality eggs.Start introducing the pair by placing their tanks close to one another for a couple of days., After you introduce your bettas in separate tanks, place the male in the breeding tank. Don’t allow him to see the female for a while to help prepare him to breed.Give the male a few hours to get used to the water in the breeding tank.Watch for signs of distress in the male. Symptoms of stress in bettas include swimming near the surface or banging up against the sides of the tank.

, Contain the female in a separate container and add her to the breeding tank. This can help her get used to the tank and may keep the male from getting at her immediately.You can use a hurricane glass or cut a Styrofoam cup in half as a container for the female.Place the female's container so that the male can see her, which will hopefully stimulate him to build a bubble nest for the eggs., Watch the bettas for a few days to see if you notice whether they’ve taken an interest in one another. This can help you know if you should find another mate or should watch for the female to release eggs.Flaring, or fanning the fins, is a good sign of interest of interest between bettas., It may take 4-5 days, but if there is interest between your bettas, you may notice that the male releases a bubble nest. This can help you to release the female from the hurricane glass or Styrofoam cup in time to mate.The male may make a bubble nest on the hurricane glass or Styrofoam cup.A female may release eggs before she is released. This is normal and you shouldn’t worry., If the male builds a bubble nest, he may also try and attract the female. Placing the female on top of the bubble nest will help her place the eggs in the protective bubbles.The bettas may try and attract each other with flaring.A female is ready to release eggs when she has vertical stripes visible on her sides.Even if the female has released some eggs in her container, place it on or near the bubble nest so she can continue to lay eggs., Once the male and female show interest within their protective environments, they are usually ready to mate. Learning the basics of this process can help you successfully breed bettas and help their spawn survive.After the male blows his bubble nest, he will mate with the female by wrapping himself around her several times. Thereafter, the female will lay her eggs.
It’s normal for the two fish to engage in some nipping and chasing, and it’s usually not to the death.

, Once the eggs are laid, take the female out of the tank. The male is a very devoted father and may cause her injury if she stays.A female may lie still for a few moments after laying her eggs.A male bettas may chase the female away from the bubble nest after she’s finished laying the eggs.You can replace the female in her old tank or let her rest in a holding or hospital tank for a few days., It’s not unusual for bettas to have torn fins after they mate. Injuries make bettas more susceptible to disease, so you may want to treat the water to help ensure that your bettas stay healthy.A commercial water treatment such as MarOxy or Bettamax can help to ward off disease in recently mated bettas.You can purchase water treatments at most pet stores and specialty fish suppliers.
Both the male and female may suffer stress from the mating. Make sure to watch for signs of this and take appropriate action, such as separating the fish in separate tanks from other bettas.

, Watch for the eggs to hatch after about 36 hours. The fry, which look like little black dots, will also have little tails hanging down. Recognizing the development of the baby fish can help you remove the male fish and ensure the safety and health of the fry.You can put the male back in his original tank.Feed the fry once they're free swimming. Do not feed them when they're still hanging from the bubbles or on the bottom of the tank.To make fry food, put a lightly boiled potato in a jar of aquarium water for 2 days to culture microscopic creatures collectively called ""infusoria.""Put some of the water bearing infusoria in the tank water 2 times a day.
You can keep the fry together for approximately 7 months, at which point they may start fighting and flaring with one another."

Look for a rounder, thicker body shape.,

Look for a thinner, more streamlined body shape.,
Look for a concave vent.,
Look for a midline ridge.,
Watch for chasing behavior.,
Understand that gender differences will only appear once the goldfish reach maturity.,
Know that there is no foolproof method for sexing goldfish, other than observing the spawning process.,
Understand that these identification methods only hold true for healthy, well-fed goldfish.",How to Tell if Your Goldfish Is a Male or Female," Female goldfish tend to have a rounder, thicker body shape than males of the same age and species.


They also tend to be deeper-bodied, which is useful for identifying sex from a side view.
As breeding season approaches, the females will begin to develop roe (eggs), which may cause a bulge on one side, making the female look asymmetrical or lop-sided.;
, The vent (anal opening) of a female goldfish is rounder than the male's and tends to protrude from the body slightly as breeding season approaches.


When viewed from the side, the vent may appear as a raised surface on the female's abdomen.
In addition to a protruding vent, the female's anal fin may appear slightly thicker than the male's., One of the main tell-tale signs that your goldfish is male, is the development of tubercles (small white spots) on their gill-shields.


Usually the breeding tubercles will only last during the fish's breeding period, however in older males who have lived through several breeding seasons, the tubercles may be present all year round.
The tubercles may also appear on the pectoral fins, on the face and on the scales on the body of the fish..
Be aware that although the presence of tubercles is a good indication that your goldfish is male, their absence does not necessarily mean that your fish is female, as not all males will develop tubercles., Males tend to have longer, thinner, more streamlined body shapes than females of the same age and species.

, A male goldfish's vent is usually narrow and elongated, making it somewhat ovular in shape. It will also be concave (an innie), rather than protruding.

, If possible, look at the underbelly of the fish to see whether it has a midline ridge: a raised line running from the back of the pelvic fins to the vent. In females, this line will either be very faint or non-existent.

, One of the most reliable ways to identify male goldfish is to observe their behavior during spawning season.


A male goldfish will chase a female around the tank or pond, staying close behind and slightly beneath her, sometimes nudging her rear.
The male will also attempt to push the female against the side of the tank or into any plants, in order to force her to spawn.
However, in the absence of females, male goldfish will also chase each other around, so it's a good idea to use physical indications as well as behavioral ones to identify sex., The differences between male and female goldfish will only become obvious once the fish reach maturity, which usually takes about a year.


However, the rate of maturation will depend on species and sex. Some breeds of male goldfish will reach maturity by the time they are 9 months old, while some females may take up to three years to reach maturity.
Short of DNA analysis, identifying the sex of young goldfish is practically impossible. If you wish to increase your chances of having both male and female fish, your best bet is to purchase at least six healthy fish of the same variety. Statistically, there is a 98% chance that at least one fish will be a different sex from the others., Accurately identifying goldfish as either male or female is very difficult, and even the experts get it wrong from time to time. This is due to the fact that there are many exceptions to the rules:


Some male goldfish will not develop tubercles, while in rare cases a female goldfish will. Some female goldfish will not have protruding vent, while male goldfish sometimes will.
In addition, some breeds of goldfish do not comply with general rules - for example, some breeds (such as ranchu or ryukin) naturally have very round, thick body shapes, which makes gender identification through body shape almost impossible.






As a result, it is best to identify the sex of your goldfish by observing multiple signs, rather than trusting a single sign alone.

, Unhealthy goldfish may not follow regular spawning behavior or develop the usual physical characteristics that indicate gender. As a result, it is important to ensure the health of your goldfish (this includes things such as providing good quality water and fish food) before you attempt to identify the sex.


For example, an unhealthy male goldfish may not develop the tubercles usually seen during spawning season, while an unhealthy female may not have a convex vent.
Body shape can also be misleading. A thin goldfish may be mistakenly identified as male (as males are usually smaller), but you may be looking at an underfed female. On the other hand, you may read a distended abdomen as a sign that the fish is female, but the swelling may be a sign of dropsy (an internal bacterial infection)."

Keep a first aid kit.,
Prevent illness.,
Know how to recognize the first signs of illness.",How to Save a Dying Betta Fish1," Pet stores often will not carry Betta fish medication, meaning that you will need to order it online. If you do this after your Betta fish gets sick it will likely be too late.


Complete first aid kits are available online. However, you can try to save money by ordering the necessary supplies separately. Basic medications include: Bettazing or Bettamax, Kanamycin, Tetracycline, Amplicillin, Jungle Fungus Eliminator, Maracin 1, and Maracyn 2.;
, Most Betta fish ailments are caused by improper feeding and cleaning. These will be examined in greater detail later. However, a few things to always keep in mind include:


Clean the tank regularly. Too keep it clean, do not overcrowd with too many fish, add aquarium salt to water, and disinfect the tank.
To limit the spread of disease from one fish to another, immediately remove dead fish, quarantine new fish for two weeks before introducing them to a tank, and wash your hands after handling fish.Do not overfeed fish or allow food to rot in tank., The most obvious way to tell that a Betta fish is sick is to observe whether or not it wants to eat. If it is not eating or appears unexcited at the sight of food, it is likely sick. Other signs of illness include a less vibrant color or strange discolorations.Others signs that your betta fish is sick include: rubbing against items in the tank as if to scratch itself; swollen, protruded eyes; raised scales that protrude out toward you; and a fin that is clumped together rather than spread out."

Begin with water and food.,
Treat a fungal infection.,
Treat tail or fin rot.,
Treat swim bladder disorder.,
Treat ich.,
Treat Velvet.,
Treat pop-eye.,
Check for dropsy.,
Consult an aquatic veterinary specialist.",How to Save a Dying Betta Fish2," Most fish illnesses can be addressed by thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the tank. With all of these conditions, try this approach first, and then move on to medications if you don’t see improvement.


Keep track of the symptoms in case you need to consult an aquatic veterinarian to treat your fish.
Immediately remove a sick fish from a tank.

, A fish that has a fungal infection will be paler than usual, will not be active, and will have clumped together fins. Most noticeable will be the white, cotton-like patches on its body.Eliminate a fungal infection by cleaning the tank and treating fresh water with fungus eliminator. Repeat every three days until visible signs of fungus have disappeared. Treat the water with BettaZing or Bettamax to dissolve any remnants of the fungus.
Fungal infections are typically the result of a tank that has not been properly treated with salt and Aquarisol.
Fungal infections are highly infectious, so this disorder should be treated rapidly. Quarantine infected fish., In this case, your Betta fish’s fins and/or tail will turn black or red along the edges. The fin will appear to be dissolving and getting shorter. You might see holes or tears in the fin. Clean the tank once every three days. Add either Ampicillin or Tetracycline into the water to treat it. Repeat until your fish’s fin ceases to show signs that is still losing tissue. Put some fungus eliminator in the water to facilitate recovery.
The tail will repair itself over time, but might not obtain its original luster.If not treated, this condition can progress to the point where it begins to eat away at your fish’s body. Ultimately, it will be fatal.

, If the belly of the fish is enlarged, the fish might have some blockage that needs to be corrected. You might notice an absence of excrement in the tank. The fish might have trouble swimming upright, swimming instead on its side or even upside down.


This is a sign of overfeeding. The condition can easily be treated by reducing how much you feed your Betta fish.

, Your fish will have white dots all over its body and will lack appetite. It will also try to scratch itself against items in the tank. It is highly contagious and is the most common cause for fish fatalities.To treat ich, you should raise the temperature of the tank to somewhere between 78 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit over 48 hours. Add formalin or malachite green to the water., Fish with Velvet will hold their fins against their body, lose color, refuse to eat, and scratch against the gravel of the tank. It is treatable, but can be hard to spot. To verify that your fish has Velvet, shine a flashlight on it and check for a light gold or rusty film over its skin.Treat Velvet by cleaning the tank and treating the new water with BettaZing.
Velvet should not occur if you have been treating your tank properly with salt and water conditioner. If your fish contract Velvet you should reconsider how you care for the tank.

, If one of your fish’s eyes is budging out, then it has pop-eye. Unfortunately, pop-eye is not caused by a single condition. Sometimes it is treatable, but other times it is not.If several fish exhibit signs of pop-eye, the water condition is likely at fault. Test the water and replace 30% of the water daily for 4 to 5 days.
If one of the fish has pop-eye, it might be a bacterial infection. Remove the fish to a separate tank and treat with Maracyn or Maracyn II until it shows signs of improvement.
Occasionally pop-eye is the result of a serious, untreatable medical condition. If your fish does not respond to treatment it is possible that nothing can be done for it., In cases of dropsy, your fish’s stomach will begin to swell. When it swells, it will cause the scales to project out like a pinecone. It is not a specific illness, but a sign that your fish can no longer regulate fluids. It will be fatal.If caught early, dropsy can be cured by aquarium salt baths and medicines. However, since it is hard to see what kind of medicine to use (the wrong one can make it worse), this is hard. Vets can help. If the betta is severely affected, euthanizing it is an option.
Dropsy is not contagious, but it could be an indication that your water parameters are off. Check them and consider replacing your water., An aquatic veterinarian is one that specializes in treating fish. They are not as common as vets who treat cats, dogs and other household pets. Search this database to see if there is one near you.

Get a larger tank.,
Test the tank’s water.,
Change and condition the water.,
Cycle your tank.,
Regulate the tank water’s temperature.,
Use a filter in the tank.,
Put aquarium salt in the tank.",How to Save a Dying Betta Fish3," A tank size of 2.5 gallons (9.5 liters) at minimum is recommended for a single betta fish. If you have more than one fish, you should get a bigger tank to accommodate all of the fish.If you have a larger tank, you may not need to change the water as frequently. Toxins will build up more quickly and in higher concentration in a smaller tank.

, Having a good pH balance will help restrict the levels of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate, which will in turn keep your betta healthy. An ideal pH is 7.Treat the water with a dechlorinator. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to put this into the water.
Test your water for ammonia using a test kit. You will either use a dip-stick test or gather a water sample to test the water. Your ammonia level should read 0, since you just used a dechlorinator. Measure the ammonia level once per day until you start seeing ammonia levels. This will tell you how long you can go before changing the tank’s water., Twice a week, you should change the water in the tank to make sure that you don’t have dangerous levels of ammonia, nitrate and nitrite building up. You can use distilled, bottled or tap water, but each kind of water needs to be treated before it goes in the tank in order to restore the proper balance of nutrients in the water.Change 25%-50% of the water in the tank twice a week. This means you add 25% new water and keep 75% of the old water (or 50% new and 50% old).
Use aquatic water conditioners, available at your pet store for $5-$10, to adjust pH levels in the water. Use them according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Add 1 tablespoon of aquarium salt and 1 drop per gallon of a fungus preventative like Aquarisol. Do not use table salt in place of aquarium salt. Table salt may have additives like iodine and calcium silicate, which can be harmful to fish.

, Cycling your tank means that you build up good bacteria in the tank so that your fish can flourish. This bacteria will help keep ammonia levels low by breaking down fish waste into nitrite and then into nitrate. Start with a fresh tank with no fish in it to cycle the tank.Add an ammonia source to start the process of generating the good bacteria in nitrate. You can either add fish food or an ammonia solution to the tank. Use a test kit to test the water for ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels. Your ammonia level will initially read 0.
Test the water every day and the ammonia level will start to show trace amounts. The ammonia level will then drop as the nitrite level starts to show up. Then the nitrite level will decrease and the nitrate level will go up.
Add a few flakes of fish food every day to keep the ammonia levels generating, which generate nitrite and nitrate levels in turn.
Be patient. Cycling a tank properly can take 4-6 weeks to introduce the proper levels into the tank. The improved water quality will keep your fish healthy and sustain longer lives.

, The tank’s temperature should be between 75 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit. Use a 25 watt heater to keep the temperature constant. This heater is available at your pet store or online for $10-15.Keep a thermometer in the tank and check it periodically to make sure the temperature is constant.
Keep the tank in a warm area of the room. The tank should maintain an even temperature. Keeping it by a window can risk exposure to colder temperatures that can be damaging to the betta.

, Place a filter in the tank to help clear the water of impurities. The filter should not cause the water to stir too much, as bettas don’t like turbulent water. Filters are available at the pet store for $30-$150, depending on the size of your tank.Try an air stone that connects to a small pump if you don’t want to get a filter. Air stones are available at your pet store for $5-$10.
Buy a filter that is the correct size for your tank.

, Aquarium salt is derived from evaporated sea water and can be used in fish tanks to reduce nitrite in the water and promote healthy gill functions. It can also help increase electrolytes, which improve a fish’s overall health.Add 1 tablespoon of aquarium salt for every 5 gallons of water.
Add aquarium salt to new fish tanks, when you are changing the water, and when you are trying to figure out a fish’s health problems.
Do not use table salt in place of aquarium salt. Table salt may have additives like iodine and calcium silicate, which can be harmful to fish.

Empty the tank.,
Throw away any live plants.,
Remove the gravel.,
Make a bleach and water solution.,
Rinse the tank multiple times.,
Put any other tank items (filter, plastic plants, etc.)",How to Save a Dying Betta Fish4," If your fish needs to be isolated, you will also need to disinfect your tank to prevent the transfer of any health problems to other fish. You also should disinfect your tank before putting your fish back into it.Pour out water and remove all objects from the tank.

, These cannot be disinfected, so it is best to start with new plants if you use live plants or just use fake plants from the stores.

, If you have natural gravel at the bottom of your tank, remove all of this and bake it on a cookie sheet at 450 °F (232 °C) for one hour. Cool the gravel completely. Do not bake gravel if it is coated with any material, as this will melt. In this case, it is probably best to throw it away and start with fresh gravel., Use 1 part bleach to 9 parts fresh tap water and put it in a clean spray bottle. Use regular household bleach with no added detergents. Be careful to never add bleach when fish are in the tank, as this will kill fish.


Spray your bleach solution on the inside of the tank. Let it sit for 10-15 minutes.

, You need to make sure that all of the bleach residue is rinsed out of the tank so it will not contaminate the water after you put the fish back in. Rinse several times, and then rinse it once more for good measure. Wipe the tank dry with a paper towel.

, in the bleach solution in a bucket or bowl. Let them sit for 10 minutes, and then rinse them multiple times before putting them back in the tank.

Feed bettas appropriate food.,
Do not overfeed your betta.,
Clean leftover food out of the tank.,
Make your fish fast once a week.",How to Save a Dying Betta Fish5," Purchase pellets that are made from fishmeal or shrimp meal.Occasionally supplement with a piece of blanched pea once per week or fruit flies with wings attached., A betta’s stomach is about the size of its eyeball, so feed it about that amount twice per day. That translates to approximately 2 or 3 pellets per feeding.


Let pellets soak in water 10 minutes before feeding. This will prevent them from swelling up inside your fish’s stomach.If your fish has a rounded belly, you may be feeding it too much. If its belly looks a little caved in, then you might not be feeding it enough., Uneaten food becomes toxic in the water, contributing to the growth of bacteria and ammonia levels. Bacteria in the tank will in turn start attacking your fish.

, If your fish seems to have trouble digesting food or seems constipated, you can give it a rest by not feeding it once a week. This will not harm the fish and will allow the fish to work through some of the food already in its system."
"
Isolate your fish.,
Disinfect after handling your fish.,
Administer medication to your fish.",How to Save a Dying Betta Fish6," If your fish has a contagious condition, it will need to be removed from the tank so that any illness does not infect other fish. Prepare a holding tank for your fish by putting fresh, conditioned water into the tank. Remove your fish from the original tank and put it in the new tank.


If your fish is experiencing stress because of a new fish or environmental change in its tank, you might find that it feels better after being isolated.

, Many disorders that fish have can be highly contagious. Anything that touched the fish or the water, including your hands, the fishnet, a spoon, etc., will need to be disinfected before it should come in contact with another fish. Use antibacterial soap to wash your hands.Disinfect any other item that has come in contact with the fish or the water in the tank using a bleach solution of 1 part bleach and 9 parts water. Soak items for 10 minutes in the bleach solution and rinse very thoroughly. Rinse again for good measure. Never add bleach to the fish tank when fish are in it, as this can kill fish.

, Once you have positively identified your fish’s ailment, you can administer a common fish medication to your fish.Give the medication intended for the ailment, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.


Be sure to give your fish the entire course of medication as recommended by the medicine’s manufacturer.
Use good judgment when giving medications to your fish. Don’t try out several medications guessing at the right one. If you are unsure, you might consider consulting an aquatic veterinarian.

Compare the fins.,
Look for an egg sac.,
Check if the betta flares its gills.",How to Name Your Betta Fish1," Male betta fish typically have longer fins than females. Fully grown male bettas will have long flowy fins, but female bettas have shorter, less frilly fins.Young male bettas may still have short fins, so only use fin length to determine the sex of full grown bettas.;
, Female betta fish have an egg sac on their bellies. The egg sac looks like a tiny white dot, no bigger than a grain of salt. If your fish has an egg sac, it is most likely a female.

, When a male betta fish sees another male betta fish, he flares up his fins and gills to try and intimidate the other fish. Females are less aggressive and usually won’t flare.Try putting a mirror in front of your betta to get it to flare. Quickly remove the mirror if your fish flares so it doesn’t try to charge at the other “fish”.

View the colors of your fish.,
Observe the way your fish swims.,
Notice where your betta likes to hangout.",How to Name Your Betta Fish2," Betta fish come in many different colors, and the color can look different when it shimmers in the light. Take some time to notice all of the different hues of your betta’s scales.Names like Rainbow, Coral, or Shimmer could be good names.
Try using different languages to describe the colors. A name like Rûng, the Thai word for rainbow, would be great since betta fish are are also called siamese fighting fish.
Try putting the fish bowl near a window to see what your fish looks like in sunlight.

, Each individual fish is unique, so their behavior will be slightly different. Some fish might swim quickly around the bowl, or dart back and forth, but others may swim very calmly, or just float in one place for a while.


The swimming pattern of your fish can help you give it a name to match its personality. Names like Speedy, Slowpoke, Zipper, or Turtle could work.

, Sometimes, looking at where your fish likes to stay or sleep can help you come up with a name.


Does your fish hide in the leaves of a plant? You could name it Heidi.
Is your fish always resting at the bottom of the bowl? A name like Lazy Bones or Droopy would be appropriate.

"
"
Brainstorm a list of names.,
Say the names out loud.,
Get the opinions of others.",How to Name Your Betta Fish3," Write down every name that comes into your mind when thinking about your fish. Keep going until you have a nice size list of names to choose from.Don’t worry about writing down names you think are silly. When you brainstorm you want to write down everything that comes to mind.
Try using the betta’s color with a noun to create a name. For example, a name like “Red Fighter”, “Blue Swimmer”, “Green Monster”, or “Yellow Angel” might work.

, Go through your list of names, and say each one out loud to your fish. Try using each name in a sentence talking about your fish. See how it makes you feel when you call your fish by each name.


Notice if your fish makes a reaction to one of the names by swimming towards you or doing something different.

, If you are stuck trying to brainstorm a name, try getting help from others. Invite people over to meet your new fish and ask them what they would name it, or show your list to your friends and family to see which name they think is best.You can also post a picture or video of your fish on social media and ask people what the name should be.
It might help to research some commonly used names for fish like Bubbles, Finney, Sushi, or Stripes.

Aquarium size Just because a betta can survive in a bowl so small it can't move doesn't mean it should be put in one.,
Tank Placement.,
Filtration.,


,
The following information applies if you do not have a cycled tank.,Be sure to add a de-chlorinator (also known as a water conditioner) to the water, this will remove harmful chlorine that is in tap water that would kill your fish

,
Be sure that the water you are changing is the same temperature as the old water the betta was in to avoid temperature shock which can be deadly to your betta.,
Heating.,
Lighting.,
Substrate.,
Plants.,
Cover.,
Keeping Your Aquarium Clean.,
Put it all together.,
Interacting with your friend.",How to Make a Desktop Betta Bowl,"


The tank size should be at least 3 gallons (11.4 L).;
, If you want a Betta tank as a display on a desk or table, place it away from drafts and direct sunlight. Also avoid areas above appliances or on top of places that are moved a lot (for example a filing cabinet).

, Bettas, like all fish, need filtration. Small air-operated corner filters work great. Remember to cycle the filter before getting your fish.

,, Most betta keepers do not have a cycled fish tank and often keep betta fish in small bowls or tanks, this information is directed towards this type of fish keeper and is important to note:


Betta fish need frequent partial water changes. Betta fish secrete ammonia at all times. This ammonia is invisible but deadly to betta fish. Not changing the water often enough is the number one cause of betta disease and death. NEVER change all of the water at once, it will remove all the beneficial bacteria, instead, do partial water changes. You can get a test kit for ammonia to monitor it (ammonia should never read about .25 ppm in a betta tank) OR you can follow the following guidelines:
−3 gallon (−11.4 L) will need 25% water changes twice a week
−5 gallon (−18.9 L) tank with filter will need 25%-50% once a week
−10 gallon (−37.9 L) tank with filter will need 25% once a week
Many care sheets given out by pet stores are wrong about the frequency of water changes. Because of this many betta fish languish and die in poor tank conditions because they are sold as low maintenance fish. This simply isn't true. *You can always do an ammonia test to be sure.

,, Use an in tank thermometer to check the water temperatures.

, Because Betta are tropical fish, they require a heater. The heater should be 5 watts per gallon. The temperature should be 75-80F.

, Bettas don't require or prefer a lot of bright light; a regular room light is fine. Any light place above the bowl should be a few inches above so the Betta still has air, and should not be left on for more than 10 hours a day.

, A popular substrate is gravel and sand. Avoid anything too sharp that can tear your Betta's thin fins; if it can tear a pantyhose, it can tear your Betta's fins.

, Live plants make a great addition to a Betta aquarium. The best for live plants is Java Fern, don't let the plant take over all the space in the tank. Silk plants are also good.

, This is very important because Betta are great jumpers, A hood that has some plastic canvas allows the fish to breath and prevents him from jumping.

, For 5–10 gallon (18.9–37.9 L) aquariums 25% weekly water changes are important to keep the water clean and prevent diseases. More frequent changes of more water are needed for containers smaller than 5 gallons (18.9 L). Vacuum the gravel, but don't change out the filter media. Replace water with water of the same water parameters.

, Setup your aquarium by placing your substrate, plants, heater, and filter. Add conditioned (with products such as Prime and Tank Buddies water conditioners) water and your Betta.

, As time goes on you will learn your Betta's personality, likes and dislikes, favorite place to sleep, etc. Interacting with your pet could save his life, by observing him every day you will immediately recognize disease and treat pronto. Betta tend to be hardy but like all fish can get diseases."
"
Try a pet store.,
Look into breeders.,
Consider buying a betta online.",How to Pick a Betta Fish1," Bettas are generally easy to find in pet stores, as well as department stores that sell pets. In general, this is the quickest option to get a betta, as you can usually select and purchase a betta in the same day.If you decide to go the pet store route, it's best to go with a reputable pet store that specializes in selling these animals only. Department stores, or large chain pet stores, may keep bettas in small containers and in poor conditions, making the fish more prone to health problems.
The best pet stores will keep their betta in clean tanks. They will also have a variety of different types of fish available. Workers at reputable pet stores will be able to answer any questions you have about fish and fish care.;
, Many people prefer to go through a breeder to purchase a betta. Breeders generally know how to breed the healthiest fish. Breeders can also be more ethical than pet stores, as they're dedicated to keeping fish in safe, healthy conditions and finding responsible pet owners. It may take slightly longer to obtain a betta from a breeder, however.See if you can find a betta breeder in your area. You can look online or keep your eyes open for ads in the local newspaper or at places like pet supply stores and vet clinics.
Unfortunately, you may be unable to go through a breeder if you can't find one in your area. Not everyone has a betta breeder near to them.

, If you want a high quality purebred betta, you can buy one online from a reputable breeder. Many breeders are willing to sell and ship their bettas online as long as you are willing to talk with them to verify you will be a responsible owner.However, you are more prone to scams when working online. Only buy from breeders who are willing to talk to you and answer any questions you have in a prompt, professional manner.
Make sure to select an online breeder who has been breeding betta for a long time. The longer someone has been breeding, the more likely they are to breed quality fish.

The bigger the fish, the older.,
Look at the colors.,
Examine the fins.,
Check the gills.,
Look over the body.,
Examine the eyes.",How to Pick a Betta Fish2," Since bettas can live anywhere from five to seven years, if you want to maximize your betta's time living with you, you should try to find a somewhat small one. Beware, as baby betta fish have different needs and will die if you treat them as an adult. , Color is an indication of health for bettas. When examining a betta, look for a fish with bright, vibrant coloring.Most bettas are brightly colored, but may have some pale colors filling in gaps between stripes and spots. Certain breeds of betta, such as piebald and Cambodian bettas, are lighter in appearance, having a peach color.
Horizontal stripes can be an indicator of ill health. Avoid getting a betta if it has horizontal stripes.

, Fins should be free of discoloration, disease, or visible wounds. Clamped fins may be a sign a betta is ill or the water condition is poor. Black, raggedy fins can be a sign of fin rot., You want to choose a betta with healthy gills. Both gills should open and close without trouble. If a fish is gasping for air, and one or both set of gills is not opening and closing, this is a sign of ill health. Red marks around the gills can also be a sign of poor health., You should quickly scan a betta's body before purchasing it to make sure it's in good health. Make sure the betta does not have any obvious signs of illness. A healthy betta will be free of the following:Missing fins
Lumps or bumps
Red streaks on the gills
A sprinkled salt appearance 
White, fuzzy patches (do not confuse this with normal coloration patches some have)
A distended belly
Raised scales

, You want to make sure your betta has healthy eyes as well. Ideally, a betta should have clear white eyes. Milky eyes, bulgy eyes, or reddish circles around the eyes are all signs of poor health."
"
Make sure the fish's jar is clean.,
Take note of any strange odors.,
Look for bubbles on the surface of the tank.",How to Pick a Betta Fish3," Bettas are usually kept in a small jar away from other fish. This jar should be filled with fresh, clear water. The tank should also be free of debris from leftover food. This could be an indication a betta is not eating, which can be a sign of ill health., If you notice any strong unpleasant odors, this is a bad sign. A betta's tank should be relatively odor-free. If you notice strong smells, this may be a sign of poor health., Bettas frequently blow bubbles onto the surface of the tank. This may indicate the betta is content and comfortable, a sign of good health. However, no bubbles is not necessarily a sign of ill health. The presence of bubbles can, say, be a tiebreaker if you're stuck between two bettas, but it should not be the first factor you consider."

Identify what type of goldfish you have.,
Look at the color.,
Notice the shape of the caudal fin.,
Observe its size.",How to Tell if Your Goldfish Is an Adult1," Different types of goldfish have different characteristics. Understanding what breed you have can help you determine the proper adult coloring and growth for your fish.


If your goldfish is metallic yellow or orange with white markings, it may be a common or comet goldfish. These are marked by their sharp, forked tail.
If your goldfish is metallic yellow or orange but has a double, flowing tail, it may be a veiltail or a fantail.
If your goldfish is black with bulging “telescope” eyes, it is probably a black moor.
If your fish has calico markings, it is likely a shubunkin. These colors might include orange, white, gray, blue, and yellow with black speckles.;
, The color of your goldfish can determine its age. It is very common for a goldfish to change color through its life, although it is most common in the first year of life.For most varieties of goldfish, a bronze or brown coloring may indicate that it is under a year old. If it has a gold metallic coloration, it is probably an adult between one or two and ten years of age.Black Moor juveniles may be silver or dark gray before darkening to black as adults.Shubunkins will be multiple colors, but blue is often the most prominent color in adults.Some goldfish begin to turn white as they grow old.

, The caudal fin is the fin at the back of the fish. For most varieties of goldfish, this can indicate the age of the fish. A young goldfish will have a rounded caudal fin. The adult's caudal fin is sharply forked, and the points look well defined.Goldfish with flowing tails or double tails will not have a pronounced caudal fin. These include the veiltail and fantail varieties. Instead of changing shape, its tail will grow in length as it grows older. Veiltail’s caudal fin can grow up to two inches long as an adult., If kept in proper tank or pond conditions, a common goldfish will be around 5 inches (12.7 cm) after a year and 9 inches (22.9 cm) after two years.You can eye your goldfish to see how large it has become.


If you keep your goldfish in a small bowl, you may find that its growth is stunted. In this case, size may not be a good indicator of maturity.Some goldfish can grow over 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length.

"
"
Wait until it is the proper size.,
Check for physical breeding characteristics.,
Watch for mating behavior.",How to Tell if Your Goldfish Is an Adult2," It is impossible to tell the gender or sexual maturity of your fish before it has grown to three inches or eight centimeters in length. This is when the sexual characteristics of your fish begin to develop.This will typically occur after one year of age, although fish in aquariums may take longer to mature., If you are looking to breed your goldfish, you should watch for the development of breeding characteristics. These will begin to appear around one year of age.


Males will develop small white spots on the operculum (gill cover) and the pectoral fin. These white spots are called breeding tubercles.
A female’s abdomen will become fuller and rounder when it is ready to breed.While it is impossible to accurately sex your fish before it has developed these physical characteristics, in general, males tend to be smaller and slimmer than females., When it is time to mate, male fish will chase the female fish around the tank. It will swim close to the female’s abdomen, and you may notice it bumping into the female’s stomach area.If you notice hundreds of clear, spherical eggs, your female fish has laid eggs. This is a definite sign of sexual maturity.


Some breeds, such as the Black Moor or Shubunkin goldfish, mate only in summer while the common goldfish can mate at any time of year provided it has proper tank conditions.Goldfish that live in ponds will typically mate in spring."
"
Consider where you purchased your fish.,
Provide plenty of space for the fish to grow.,
Keep the tank water clean and warm.",How to Tell if Your Goldfish Is an Adult3," If you bought your fish from a pet store, it is likely to be small and young. Pet stores may not have given the fish adequate nutrition or space as a young fry, meaning that its growth will be stunted for life. You will also be uncertain of the fish’s pedigree; a fish typically only grows as large as its parents. If you want to ensure that your fish reaches its full size or sexual maturity, you should try to buy your goldfish from a breeder., Your goldfish’s growth may be stunted if it does not have a proper tank. This means that your goldfish may not reach sexual maturity, nor will it reach its full adult size. It is not necessarily the size that does the damage, but the build up of waste matter in a confined bowl of water. Low oxygen levels in small bowls can also affect your fish's growth.A single common Goldfish should be kept in at least 48 gallons (181.7 L) of water. Add 14 gallons (53.0 L) per each additional fish. A single fancy Goldfish can be kept in 36 gallons (136.3 L) with 12 gallons (45.4 L) per each additional fish., The water temperature should be between 60 degrees F (15 C) up to the mid 70s (23 C). This is particularly important if you want your fish to reach sexual maturity.Poor water conditions are the primary reason why some goldfish have stunted growth and die young.You should replace about 20% of the tank’s water every two weeks to keep the water clean.A filter in your aquarium will make sure that the water is clean and properly oxygenated.

"
"
Consider tank volume.,
Understand fish “personalities.” Like people, fish can, and do, have different personalities.This means that some fish will be a lot more territorial than other fish and that the fish you choose for your female betta community may not make compatible tank-mates.,
Learn how to care for your betta fish’s habitat.,
Learn how to feed your betta.,
Recognize the signs of a healthy betta.,
Include at least 3, and more preferably 5-7 female bettas in the tank.Never keep less than 3 females together in a community tank.,
Choose dark gravel or a sand substrate to bring out the color on your female bettas.If you want color, choose colored gravel instead; however, neutral-colored gravel mimics the bettas’ natural environment and may help reduce stress.Larger size gravel traps uneaten food.,
Find a suitable water filter.,
Purchase a water heater for your tank.,
Find a suitable aquarium water conditioner.,
Add water and allow the tank to cycle for 1 week before introducing fish.Allowing the tank to cycle means allowing it to establish a bacterial bed in the filter.You can also add a biological conditioner to your tank before you add fish.,
Purchase fish, and introduce all the girls to the tank at one time, one by one.,
Ensure your tank is well-planted.Include plants (live or silk will work), as well as features such as driftwood or caves.This will allow weaker females to feel more secure because it breaks up direct sight lines between them and stronger, more dominant females.Providing enough hiding places is required for a healthy sorority tank of bettas.Each betta should be able to claim their own territory, giving them a place to “patrol” as well as a place to hide.If you are going to choose fake plants, pick silk plants instead of plastic plants.,
Observe your tank.,
Monitor for aggressive personalities.,
Approach communal housing on a case-by-case basis.There is a chance that your community tank may not work out the first time around: you may have one or two fish that do not get along with the rest.",How to Make a Female Betta Community," There is no strict minimum volume for a community tank; however, most community tanks that include multiple fish will need to be at least 10 gallons.Anything under 10 gallons will be problematic due to high bioload (the amount of living organisms in your aquarium that make waste).Make sure you have the space and financial resources to purchase and maintain a tank of this size.


In addition to tank volume, make sure you consider a tank with a hood or lid- betta fish are known jumpers!;
,


You will need to prepare a “plan B” in case one of your fish is too aggressive for a community tank.As a contingency plan, consider housing the overly-aggressive female separately and solitarily. (PLEASE NOTE: It is very difficult to know which betta is causing the trouble and if she is the only trouble-maker)

, Make sure you monitor temperature, provide treated water, monitor the pH (it should be between 6.5 and 8), add some aquarium salt to the water to prevent your betta from getting diseases and parasites, and change approximately 25% of your tank’s water once a week with treated water (in addition, perform a 100% water change once every 2 months).Keep a clean habitat for your bettas. Your tank needs to be cleaned once a week or once every two weeks if it has a filter.Scrub the inside walls of your tank, but never use soap. Make sure the fishes’ waste and uneaten food that have accumulated in the gravel or sand of your fish tank are cleared out.

, Bettas should be fed once or twice a day. Skip one day a week so your bettas’ digestive systems can take a rest.These fish are carnivores, so make sure you include dried bloodworms or dried shrimp.Keep in mind that your betta’s stomach is the size of her eyeball.Be cautious of overfeeding! Your fish will overfeed if you provide too much food.
Remember that bettas won’t like flake food, even if it is marketed for bettas. This is because they are true carnivores!, A healthy betta will be active and alert, will eat regularly, and will react aggressively to any outside stimuli. Common health issues include fin rot (characterized by frayed or disintegrating fins) and Ick (characterized by white spots on fin or body).

, If you attempt to keep only 2 females, one will typically assume a more dominant position and will bully the other.Remember that the more fish you intend to house together, the bigger of a tank you will need to purchase. A 20-gallon tank is recommended for more than 5 female bettas., This food can rot and negatively affect aquarium health.To avoid this, choose gravel that is small in size for your betta tank.

, You will generally want to look for a water filter that will turn over the water 8x-10x GPH (Gallons Per Hour).Always check the GPH when buying a filter: for example, if you have a 10 gallon tank, you should look to get at least a 100 GPH filter.Consider a filter with a flow that is adjustable. Betta fish prefer a relatively weaker flow of water from the filter., The water temperature should be maintained in the range of 72 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.This is the range preferred by aquarium fish, but the ideal temperature is 78 degrees Fahrenheit.A general rule for choosing a heater is to allot 50 watts per ten gallons.Also look to purchase a thermometer for your tank. An electronic thermometer is convenient and easy to read.

, If you add untreated tap water to your fish tank, you will be exposing your fish to potentially harmful chemicals. Try a water conditioner that removes chlorine, chloramines, and heavy metals, and simultaneously detoxifies ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates., A product such as Cycle Biological Aquarium Supplement is recommended., Buy all your fish at the same time, but introduce them one by one, starting with the one that seems the most passive. This will allow each fish to establish her own territory before the addition of another tank mate.Make sure all your fish are generally around the same size.If you can buy “sisters” (or fish from the same spawning), they will have a better chance of getting along.Consider sticking to odd numbers when stocking your tank. Look to keep 3 or 5 betta fish in a 10-gallon tank or 7 or 9 betta fish in a 20-gallon tank., Silk plants will not tear the bettas' delicate fins., The females may nip at each other’s fins at first, but once they form a pecking order, this should become less chaotic. However, occasional squabbles between the fish in your community tank are completely normal and should be expected., Female betta fish will perform a “pecking order,” or dominance hierarchy.This hierarchy will be established quickly. Keep an eye out for any fish that is particularly noticeable as a bully, and also for fish that seem to be constantly antagonized.If you notice one fish that does not seem to be getting along with the rest, remove it from the tank. Being bullied will cause the fish stress and can result in illness.

, If this is the case, consider removing the problematic fish from the tank as soon as you recognize an ongoing issue.

One way to interact with your betta is to put his tank where he can see what you are doing.Although this is not direct interaction, it allows your betta to see you as part of his environment, which can keep him mentally alert and occupied.


Because he’ll be watching you, do not be surprised if your betta swims to the top of tank when you walk over to feed him.
Place the tank in a room where you spend a lot of time, such as the family room.;
, Bettas are very intelligent fish. Although you may not have thought it possible to teach a fish a trick, you can certainly do with your betta. One trick you can teach him is to follow your finger. This one is pretty simple—place your finger on your betta’s tank and wait for him to respond by swimming towards your finger. Move your finger in all directions on the outside of his tank and watch him follow your finger around.Reward your betta with a small piece of food each time he follows your finger.

, Place a small piece of food just above the water’s surface. You can place the food on a popsicle stick or even your finger. Because betta naturally feed at the water’s surface, this will be an easy trick for your betta to learn., Since bettas enjoy observing their environment, pique your betta’s interest by drawing on his tank. Use a non-permanent dry erase marker and draw different designs.Stand by and watch your betta swim towards the design and investigate it.


Experiment with different color markers and different shapes.

, Hold a small handheld mirror close to your betta’s tank. Since your betta is so intelligent, he will likely recognize his own reflection. When he does this, he will flare his fins,which can be a very beautiful display.


You can also teach him to flare with a pen. As soon as your betta flares at the sight of his reflection in the mirror, hold a pen up to the mirror. After a few repetitions, hold only the pen up to get your betta to flare. Make sure to use the same color pen each time.Your betta may become riled up after seeing his reflection. Although there is no recommended amount of time to hold up a mirror in front of your betta,watch his body language to see if he is getting agitated.

, In the wild, bettas swim in shallow waters.However, do not mistake this for your betta needing only a small bowl to swim in. Your betta’s tank should be at least 5 gallons,but bigger is always better—10 gallons or more.If you can find it, use a tank that is longer than it is high.This will mimic your betta’s natural shallow water habitat.
Small bowls and vases are not recommended for betta fish., Bettas swim in relatively still waters in the wild, so you should select a gentle filter that would not create a strong water current in your betta’s tank.Adjustable-flow filters are also an option, since you could adjust the strength of the filter to decrease the current.Do not select a tank that already has a filter attached (e.g., eclipse systems). These filters are not adjustable and tend to be too strong for bettas.Although a filter will help keep the water clean, you will still need to replace the water regularly to reduce nitrate levels and maintain overall good water quality.
Ask the staff at your local pet store about the strength of the filters available in the store. They should be able to help you choose which one will work best for your betta’s tank.

, Wild bettas live in shaded waters and are accustomed to regular cycles of light and dark from the sun. An aquarium light will be useful in mimicking this same light cycle. Turn the light on during the day and off at night.In addition to mimicking a natural light cycle, the light will also be necessary for the live plants in your betta’s tank.
There are several types of bulbs (e.g., full-spectrum, LED, incandescent) for lighting an aquarium. A full-spectrum bulb is most similar to natural daylight,and is thus a good type of bulb for your betta’s tank.
If you plan to add live plants to the tank, the bulb’s wattage should be approximately 2 to 5 watts per gallon of water.Bulbs are available at your local pet store. The staff at the store can explain how to safely install the bulb above your betta’s tank.
Do not use direct sunlight as a light source. It could stimulate algae growth in your betta’s tank., Your betta probably will not enjoy living in a tank that just has water in it. One way to decorate is to place live plants in his tank. Since bettas naturally swim in shaded areas, the live plants will provide your betta with shade from the light bulb.Dense areas of live plants provide ideal shade areas.When you are first setting up the tank, add the plants when the tank is half-full. This will make it easier to place the plants where you want them.Following the initial set up, consider switching out the plants during a water change, when you will be removing some of the tank’s water.
Fake plants are not recommended for your betta’s tank. They can have sharp edges that could damage your betta’s fragile fins.Aquarium caves are good decoration for your betta’s tank, and give him a place to hide.Hiding places provide shade and reduce your betta’s stress. Aim to have about three-fourths of his tank’s open area covered with different types of hiding spaces.Decorate your betta’s tank with driftwood. Make sure that it does not have any rough or sharp edges.Terra cotta pots are not good decoration for your betta’s tank. They have sharp edges that could damage your betta’s fins., Bettas are tropical fish, so warm water (78 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit) is best for your betta. Use a water heater and thermometer to respectively maintain and monitor the tank’s water temperature.Water heaters are not good for small tanks (less than three gallons), since the water could warm up too quickly and make the betta sick.Water that is too cold can suppress your betta’s immune system,leaving him more susceptible to infection and illness.
The staff at your local pet store can explain how to install the heater and thermometer in your betta’s tank.
Bettas prefer slightly acidic water. Maintain the tank’s pH at 6.5 to 7., Before adding your betta to the tank, you will need to run what is called a fishless cycle. This cycle allows for the growth of good bacteria in your tank’s filter that will keep ammonia levels near zero in the tank. The bacteria will convert ammonia to nitrate through a process known as the nitrogen cycle.A fishless cycle usually takes four to six weeks.You will need to use your own ammonia source, such as household ammonia, to start the cycle.
Use a test kit to maintain ammonia levels at 2 to 3 parts per million during the cycle. This will allow enough bacteria to grow to handle the waste produced from your betta.
Adding your betta to the tank before running the fishless cycle could expose him to high levels of ammonia (produced in his waste), since there would be no bacteria to break it down. Ammonia is toxic and could make your betta very sick (e.g., respiratory distress, erratic swimming, internal and external bleeding.
Nitrate is also harmful for your fish. The good bacteria cannot break down nitrate, but you would remove the nitrate when you change the water.

, You will have a hard time earning your betta’s trust if you add a tank mate that is not a good match. Bettas were originally bred for aggression. However, when they started being bred for color, the aggression was not fully bred out of them.Bettas, particularly male bettas, can be very aggressive towards other fish. On the other hand, bettas could be very submissive, leaving them vulnerable to attack by a tank mate.
Bettas are territorial fish, particularly during breeding season in the wild.
Female bettas are less aggressive than male bettas and can be housed peacefully with other fish.
In the wild, bettas do not travel in schools., Several types of fish may be suitable tank mates for your betta. One type is the white cloud mountain minnow. This minnow has a peaceful temperament and is unlikely to be aggressive towards a betta. It also has a similar diet to bettas.A clown pleco is a peaceful algae eater, and would help keep the cage clean. As an armored catfish, your betta would probably avoid provoking him. A clown pleco is fairly large (four inches long) and requires a large tank (20 gallons).
Pygmy corydoras are tiny bottom feeders and are not brightly colored, so they are unlikely attract the attention of your betta.
Ember tetras are small fish that are unlikely to nip at your betta.
Harlequin rasboras make good tank mates with bettas because they live with bettas in the wild.
Remember that bettas don't need a tank mate. Your betta would do just fine swimming by himself.

, A fish whose appearance is as bright and ornate as your betta will likely be perceived as a threat to him.For examples, swordtails would not be good because they have bright coloration. Fish such as guppies, angelfish, and high-fin tetras have long flowing tails.Gourami are similarly shaped to bettas, and could thus be seen as a threat.

, Bettas have a special anatomical feature called a labyrinth bladder, which allows them to breathe air.With the ability to breathe air, bettas usually eat at the water’s surface. In fact, their mouths are turned upwards to accommodate surface feeding., Bettas are carnivorous and need high levels of protein in their diet.It is very important to buy betta-specific commercial fish food—the standard tropical fish food is not going to have enough protein for your betta.Betta pellets are ideal for your betta. Make sure to read the ingredient label: the first few ingredients should be meat, and the pellets should be approximately 40% protein.
Consider purchasing freeze dried or frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp and daphnia, all of which are great protein sources. Alternatively, you can find pellets that already contain these protein sources.

, Feed your betta twice a day, about 12 hours apart. Since your betta’s stomach is so small (about the size his eyes), he will need only two to three pellets per feeding.Try to feed your betta at the same times each day.
Do not overfeed your betta. Overfeeding can cause bloating and other serious health problems in your betta.
Overfeeding can also lead to excess food accumulation on the tank’s bottom, which dirties and pollutes the water.
If you are feeding your betta separate bloodworms, brine shrimp, or daphnia, do so only once a week. These are considered treats and should not be fed very often."

Install a heater in the tank.,
Add a thermometer to the tank.,
Place the tank in a good location.",How to Keep a Betta's Water Warm1," You must provide warm water to maintain the health of your betta fish. To do this, you will need to get a heater for your aquarium. The type of heater you need will vary, depending on how large your aquarium is. The two main types of heaters should be available at your local pet supply store.Tanks larger than 2.5 gallons will need a submersible aquarium heater.
For tanks between 2.5 and 5 gallons, you will need a 25 watt power rating. For 10 gallon tanks, purchase a 50 watt heater.
Tanks that are smaller than 2.5 gallons can use submersible 7.5 watt heater pads. These pads don't regulate temperature, so you will need to monitor the temperature of the tank often.
Lamps are not the best choice for heating as betta fish do not like bright lighting.;
, The easiest way to keep an eye on the temperature in your betta's aquarium is to install a thermometer. You will need a thermometer that is designed to be submerged into the tank water. Once your thermometer is installed you can easily check to make sure your betta is in an ideal environment.Temperatures need to be maintained at 76 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 to 26 degrees Celsius.
Place the thermometer in a place that you can easily read it.
Thermometers that stick on the side of the aquarium are often not accurate enough to use.

, Consider where the best place in your house might be for your aquarium. Look for areas that are more stable in terms of temperature, naturally helping to maintain the temperature in your tank.Avoid placing the tank next to any drafty windows or cool areas in your house.
Don't put the aquarium next to a heat source.

Maintain the quality of your tank water.,
Clean the aquarium.,
Monitor your betta's health.",How to Keep a Betta's Water Warm2," Beyond monitoring the temperature in your betta's aquarium, you will need to maintain other aspects of the water as well. Keep up with the following characteristics of the water in your betta's tank to help keep it healthy:pH level can be monitored with pH strips. These can be bought at most pet stores that sell aquariums and fish. Keep tank water neutral, with a pH of 7.
Tank water must be clean and cannot contain any chlorine. Your pet store may have dechlorination tablets available.
If possible, let your tank water sit for 24 hours before adding it to the aquarium. This allows for gases that could potentially harm your fish to be fully released.

, Regular cleaning of your betta's aquarium is a mandatory part of properly caring for your fish. How often you clean the aquarium will depend on how large your tank is.1 gallon tanks need to be cleaned every 3 days, 2.5 gallon tanks every 5 days, and 5 gallon tanks every 7 days.
Take note of the tanks temperature. You will need to match the new water to this temperature.
Scoop your fish out of the bowl and place it, along with some tank water, in a safe container.
Dump all the old water out of the tank.
Wash the tank and all decorations with warm water. Wipe the inside of the tank down with a cloth or paper towel.
Replace the decorations and refill the tank with clean, dechlorinated water.
Raise the temperature of the tank up to the temperature that the old water was.
Acclimate your fish to the bowl. Place the container with your fish in the aquarium and over the course of five minutes, add the new tank water to the container water
After your fish has acclimated, you can release it into the tank.

, In addition to keeping track of the temperature in your fishes' aquarium, you will need to watch for signs of illness. These signs of illness can inform you if anything in your betta's tank needs attention. Look for some of the following signs of common illnesses in betta fish:Fin rot will appear as damaged, frayed, or sickly looking fins and is caused by unclean water in the tank. Clean the tank and replace with clean water to help with fin rot.
Swim bladder disorder is indicated by any apparent difficulties your betta has swimming, including sinking, swimming sideways, or bobbing on the surface. This is usually caused by constipation but may also be caused by infection, parasite, or injury.
Fungal infections will appear as a fuzzy, white growth on your betta. Antibiotics, a temperature of 74 degrees Fahrenheit or 23 degrees Celsius, and adding aquarium salt can help stop this.
A disorder known as pop-eye is indicated by swollen eyes. Treat by cleaning the tank, increasing temperature to 84 degrees Fahrenheit or 28 degrees Celsius, and adding 1/8 teaspoon Epsom salt for every five gallons of water in the tank.

It can be difficult to tell what your fish's life was like before you got it. You might not know how old it is, or if it could be carrying illnesses. Betta fish in the store can be stressed, sick, and kept in poor conditions.These things can contribute to the early demise of your pet.


Healthy fish are more active than less healthy fish.
Look for signs of physical damage.
Look for discolorations that could indicate illness. Note that some betta varieties are naturally spotty.;
, This is because common betta foods have compounds which make red bettas more red, but which measurably boost the blue betta's ability to fight disease instead. These red color enhancers are called carotenoids (think orange, like carrots), and they enhance oranges, reds, and yellows in your betta fish. However, the blue bettas receive not a greater red coloration, but a stronger immune system.Females were even shown to prefer these blue males to others once they consumed these color enhancers.

, Many people do not know the age of their fish. It is possible to buy a fish late in its life, thus reducing the amount of time you will have it. By getting a younger fish, you increase the chance you will get to have your fish for a long time. However, not always the case, a smaller fish is more likely to be young; As bettas get older, their fins get longer and their bodies get bigger. Though betta naturally vary in size, by choosing a smaller fish, you're more likely to get a betta that is young. If you want to be sure that your fish is young, contact a betta breeder.Too young of a fish is not good. They can be shocked more easily by you placing it in a different environment.

, Check to see if it is dirty. Look to see if there is too much food, indicating that the fish is being over fed, or not eating. These can be telltale signs of poor care, possibly shortening your fish's life.

, Just because the fish you picked looked healthy, doesn't mean that it hasn't caught an illness from the water a store gives it. It might have caught something from other fish, if it is in a community tank. If many of the other fish nearby seem to be unhealthy, the fish you chose might be, too.

, Even though it is possible to keep bettas in a tank with other bettas, every fish has a little bit of a different personality. To be sure no fish gets harmed, keep your betta in a tank by itself, and don't buy other fish along with it unless you've done your research.

, Though many people claim that bettas are happy in very small puddles, these fish actually prefer water that is a foot or two deep, similar to the depth of rice paddies in which they are commonly found. Pick a tank that is at least a couple gallons in size, so that your betta has a comfortable amount of space to swim around in. Generally, a tank that is less than two gallons will not be big enough., Plants make a wonderful addition to your tank. Many people choose artificial plants, because they are lower maintenance. Live plants, though requiring some care, can help to improve the quality of your betta's water by filtering it and adding oxygen. In either case, when selecting live or artificial plants, it is important to avoid those with too hard or sharp of a surface. These can damage the fragile fins of your fish. These are some plants that will be safe for your fish.


Silk plants
Live Java ferns
Live Christmas tree moss

, This is one of the most essential elements of setting up a tank. Adding water straight from the tap can kill your fish. Chemicals such as chlorine and fluoxetine, as well as many others found in tap water, are very harmful to fish.They can significantly harm your fish and decrease their lifespan. It is crucial to buy a water conditioner to add to your tank's water, before you introduce your pet. This water may also need to sit a few days, so that there is enough dissolved oxygen in it for your fish to breathe.

, When water comes out of the tap, it is not typically the right temperature for your fish. As betta fish are native to Southeast Asia, they prefer warm water. Ideal temperature for their tank ranges from 72-80 degrees Fahrenheit. You may need to buy a heater and thermometer, in order to keep your fish healthy.Warm water will make your fish more active, as well as helping with their overall health.
If they get too cold, they can die.
When first setting up your tank, it will take some time for the heater to warm the water at first. You should let sit a day or two, before adding your fish.
In addition, when introducing your fish, it is important to make sure that the water they come from is the same temperature as the water they go into. Let the bag or container holding the fish sit in the new tank's water, long enough to become the same temperature, so the temperature change doesn't shock your fish, causing death.

, You can't just put a betta in a tank with any fish. They are aggressive. Two male bettas in a tank together will likely kill each other. Though female bettas can be kept together in a sorority, it is also possible that they may injure each other. Many people opt to keep bettas in solitary tanks, but if you choose to keep them with docile companions, pick appropriate ones.Neon tetra (in a school)
Bristlenose plecostomus
Glass catfish

, Without routine care, your fish will die prematurely. Remember, a fish can't tell you when it is hungry or when its water is dirty. In order to maximize your fish's lifespan, you will need to give it regular care. By created a schedule for yourself, you can help yourself to stick to it.

, Feed your fish regularly. It is important to select food that is appropriate for your fish. Many stores sell food specifically for bettas, but even then it is important to check the ingredients. Avoid food made mostly of fish meal.


Many bettas do not like fish flakes.
Pellets specially formulated for bettas can be found in most fish stores.
Freeze-dried or frozen fish food, such as blood worms or brine shrimp, are a great supplement to their diet of betta pellets.
Choose live food if you can. Research demonstrates that formulated food, such as the dry fish food you get in the store, begins to have measurable impacts on a betta's health once it exceeds 25% of their diet.Few pet bettas are privileged enough to get live food all the time. Though live food can be expensive and time consuming, it also greatly benefits a betta's health.
Buy a time-release feeder for your fish if you go on vacation, so it doesn't die of starvation while you're away.

, Every so often, you will have to change the water for your fish. This varies depending on the size of the tank, whether or not you choose to use a filter, and if you incorporate live plants. You can buy testing kits to check the water. This will ensure that your fish has a clean, healthy medium to live in, maximizing his life-span potential.

, A fish tank can grow algae on the sides that need to be cleaned off, in order to ensure the quality of the water and also your clear view of the fish. The rocks or sand at the bottom of your tank will also need to be cleaned or replaced every once and a while. Waste buildup in the base of the tank can make your fish sick, and kill him. Filters can help with this, but, even then, it may be necessary to siphon waste from the bottom.


Buy a siphon, so you can draw waste and water from the tank into a bucket.
Get a magnet cleaning kit or long-handle tank scrubber, so you don't have to get all wet when cleaning off algae.
Do not use soap to clean your tank. A good, physical cleaning (no chemicals or detergents) is often enough.

, Because of their impressive displays of aggression, many people enjoy using mirrors to coax their betta into flaring up their gills. While this can stress your fish out, if you do it frequently, it is not harmful to your fish every once and a while. Research suggests that while winners of fights between bettas consume more oxygen, there seem to be no significant consequences from these displays.Showing a betta a mirror can give it some exercise, as well as make it less aggressive toward other fish, due to the stimulation., Many times it is easy to tell how your fish is feeling by just looking at it. There are many signs that your fish is ill. Take a moment to closely inspect your fish every once and while, just to make sure they look healthy. This way you can avoid watching your fish suffer from some disease. A few things to look for:Loss of appetite
Scraping on rocks or plants
Lying on the bottom of the tank
Swimming upside down or sideways
White feces
Faded coloration
White spots

, Water samples can be analyzed with an at-home kit bought online, or at a pet store. You can also take a water sample into your local pet shop to be examined by a professional. Analyzing your water is one of the best ways to determine the nature of your fish's health problem. It can tell you if you have an imbalance in the water that is causing your fish health problems., If your water is too cold, your fish can get sick. 80 degrees is an optimal temperature for your fish, and less than optimal for many illnesses. This can help to slow the life-cycle of some diseases, like ich,as well as help the immune system of your fish.

, It might not come as much of a surprise, but if your fish is sick, then it is likely your tank is also sick. Take extra care to clean the water, the gravel, and the sides of the tank when your fish is sick. Do not use detergents, as these can kill your fish., Not only can bettas injure and get injured by other fish, just like other animals, they will catch sicknesses from each other. It is important to separate them in this situation. In this case, it may be necessary to have a small, isolation tank ready.

Check on your fish regularly and check scales.,
Play with your fish.",How to Keep a Betta Fish Alive for 4 Years," If you buy a betta at Petsmart of Walmart or anywhere make sure to check its quality. Young bettas are brightly colored and have long, flowing tails; as they get older, the colors dull. Choose a younger, brighter, healthy-looking fish in order to keep it alive for longer.


When purchasing a betta fish be sure to examine its tail. If they are bitten off of and ragged it means that the fish was most likely injured in a fight at some point and might be less healthy and hardy.;
, Bettas originated from Asia where they lived in the rice patty fields. Consequently, they prefer tanks that are more spacious rather than tall and deep. When choosing at tank, be sure to buy a filter or a heater with it. Your betta fish can survive for some time without these, but they will make your fish happier and help you take better care of your betta.

, Bettas can be picky eaters and you should buy three or more different kinds of food. This way, your fish can choose between the ones that it likes and dislikes. A good way to know what your betta likes and dislikes is give him/her a little piece. If they don't eat it or spit it out, it's possible that they don't like that kind of food.

, Bettas are called Siamese fighting fish for a reason, they are very territorial and will fight to the death. If you are considering keeping more than one betta in a tank, make sure it's at least 15 gallons (56.8 L) and heavily planted.


Do not under any circumstances keep a male betta with a male betta. No matter how big the tank is, they will kill each other.
You can keep females with females as long as there are more than five together. They will establish a pecking order and if you don't have enough, the lowest ones will be bullied to death. With more fish, the bullying is distributed enough to keep them all safe.
You can keep one male with five or more females, but it's best to separate them to keep them from harming each other.

, If you don't have a filter, change the water every week or two weeks at the most. With a filter, you can wait a little longer in between changes, but to keep bacteria from building up and affecting the health of your fish, it's better to change the water often.

, Water conditioner can be bought at your local pet supply store. It helps the water get rid of bacteria and other harmful diseases.

, Checking on your fish's scales is important because it could give you the hint that your fish is sick. If your fish has white spots it means it is sick and you should consult with your pet store or research online for a remedy.

, Train it to do tricks such as jump out of the water to take food, swim through a hoop, of follow your finger. Bettas can recognize faces and they become very attached to their owners.

Add some variety.,
Feed it worms.,

Avoid overuse of dry food.,
Soak dried pellets.,
Don’t always follow the direction.",How to Feed a Betta Fish," A betta’s stomach is roughly the size of its eyeball and should not be fed a meal larger than that at once. This translates to about 3 bloodworms or brine shrimp per feeding. If you feed pellets, this equals about 2 to 3 soaked pellets per feeding. A betta can be fed this amount once or twice a day., If your fish isn’t eating all of its food, reduce the amount you’re feeding them. If you usually feed 4 pellets per fish, try reducing to three for a while. If you notice the fish is eating very quickly, you can increase back to 4.

, Uneaten food can attract bacteria that is bad for the fish. This is especially problematic if the fish eats the food after it has gone bad.Use a small net that you would use to scoop out excrement or transfer the fish to another bowl.

, A betta should be fed every day or nearly every day. If you keep a betta in the office and you can’t feed it on the weekends, it will be just fine as long as you feed him the other five days per week.Remember to leave one day of fasting for your betta fish. It will suit its needs.It takes a betta about 2 weeks to starve to death so if your fish doesn’t eat for a few days due to illness or adjusting to a new home, don’t panic.

, In the wild, betta fish prey on a variety of smaller animals. Feeding your betta the same type over a long period of time can harm their immune system and cause them to eat less.


You can change up the type of food as often as you’d like. Try to feed the betta at least one type of food that is different from what you normally feed it at least once a week.

, Various species of small aquatic worms make up the core diet of betta fish in the wild. The most common worm for betta fish is the bloodworm which comes live, freeze dried, frozen, or in a gel.You can also use the tubifex worm which comes frozen. Live tubifex often carry parasites or bacteria so they should be avoided.
The best live worms to use are white worms, grindal worms, and black worms.
These worms are available at most major pet stores.

, You can use either live or frozen insects. The best options are daphnia, also known as a water flea, and fruit flies.These insects will be available at most pet stores.

, There are various frozen meats that betta fish can also eat. You can use brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, or frozen beef heart. These options will be available at most major pet stores., This includes dried pellets, flakes or freeze-dried foods. Some fish foods will be marketed as being for Bettas but could still cause digestion problems because of indigestible fillers and a lack of moisture.These pellet foods absorb water and expand in the fish’s stomach 2 or 3 times their original size. Some bettas will have bad reactions, potentially developing problems with constipation or bladder disorders.

, If dried foods are the only thing available, soak them in a glass of water for a few minutes before feeding them to your Betta. This will expand the pellet to its full size before the Betta digests it.Do not overfeed your Betta and cut its portion if you notice abdominal bloating. You may want to switch to live foods if your Betta is consistently bloated.

, Fish pellets or flake containers often say “Feed what your fish will eat in 5 minutes or until it stops eating.” This does not apply to betta fish. In the wild, their instinct is to eat as much as possible because they don’t know when their next meal is coming.


Overfeeding can also lead harm the water quality and cause obesity."

Most pet stores carry far more male than female bettas, because the former are more colorful and have larger fins. Whether you choose a male or female, look for a fish with a bright (not dull) color palate and healthy-looking, undamaged fins.
You might assume you should select an active, excited fish as opposed to a more mellow one, but behavior in the pet store is not necessarily a harbinger of the betta’s personality. It may be worn out after a day of people tapping on the glass, after all.
These and other selection tips, along with much more information on betta care, are provided in detail at How to Take Care of a Betta Fish.;
, You may have seen a betta in someone’s home or office swimming around in a vase or even a drinking glass. Because bettas often prefer to live alone, many people mistakenly assume that they don’t need or want much water to call home.


You may hear people say that bettas like small spaces because their natural habitat is small puddles left by buffalo tracks in their native Southeast Asia. While bettas are sometimes found in such cozy bodies of water, this is more a testament to their resiliency during the dry season than an indication of their preferred lifestyle.In reality, bettas like quite a bit of space to roam, so you should select a tank that holds at least three gallons, and even up to ten. This may seem like a lot of tank for one small fish, but you’re more likely to have a happy and healthy betta this way.The tank should also be heated to between 76° and 80° F, and have a simple filter that does not churn up the water too much (bettas prefer still water). Keep the tank clean and change the water on a regular schedule.
For more on tank preparation and maintenance, see How to Take Care of a Betta Fish.

, While some bettas don’t mind sharing a tank, many, especially males, become anxious, agitated, and aggressive when faced with other fish invading their space.


While they have earned the name “fighting fish,” betta males are more interested in establishing dominance than harming each other. But injuries and general unpleasantness do often occur when two or more males, or really just a male betta and any other fish, are put in a tank together. So it is best to assume that your male betta will live alone.
A pair of female bettas will also not likely get along, but a larger group, up to around ten, can do well together. (This is called a “sorority” of bettas.) So allow your female to either swim solo or in a herd., Betta fish generally do best with a fairly specific diet, consisting of three main foods: betta fish pellets, bloodworms, and baby brine shrimp (the latter two usually in freeze-dried form).


Two feedings of three-to-four pellets (broken up if your fish is small) or six-to-seven bloodworms / shrimp should suffice. Bettas will overeat if given the chance, to the detriment of their health. They can also suffer from constipation (indicated by bloating), which some say can be alleviated by feeding the betta a single thawed, cut-up frozen pea., Bettas are also known as Siamese fighting fish because they hail from Southeast Asia and males in particular are known to act aggressively towards each other.


Bettas are adaptable survivors. They populate the rice paddies of Southeast Asia and readily adjust to the cycles of floods and droughts.
Bettas are also one of the rare examples of a “labyrinth fish,” which means they can breathe oxygen from the air as well as from water. Thus, as long as they remain moist, they can survive out of water for short periods of time, and can live in small, brackish ponds (as are found during the dry season) for longer periods., Bettas usually like to live alone, yet they also grow bored easily and much prefer to be near “where the action is” while retaining their own defined “turf.”


Place your betta’s tank in a high-traffic, regularly-occupied part of the house, such as in the living room or near the kitchen. Bettas like movement and action, even when they are not being directly interacted with.Relocate the tank within the room occasionally, to provide the betta with a change of scenery. New things to see will attract his attention and keep him engaged and interested in your goings-on., It’s hard to develop a bond with a nameless creature of any type, so find a name that suits your new little pal’s personality. Like the lists of baby names that populate the internet, you can also find suggestions for betta names if you need some help.Bettas are sensitive to the vibrations in water caused by sounds such as human voices, which some take as meaning your fish can learn to recognize your voice and its name. See if you can trigger a regular response by saying your betta’s name each time you visit.
At very least, talking to your betta provides opportunities for interaction, which it craves, and helps establish the bond on your end. After all, who doesn’t want a good listener for a friend?

, Relocating the tank, as noted, is one way to change up the scenery, but even just looking at your fish regularly gives it something new to focus on and eventually recognize.


Male bettas are famous for “flaring” their fins — their response to encountering another betta — when seeing their reflection in a mirror. There is debate as to whether frequent “mirror flaring” is good (as stimulation) or bad (as stress) for your betta, so perhaps employ it in moderation.
In addition to the occasional mirror (if desired), you can also doodle on the tank with dry erase markers or apply sticky notes cut into different shapes, or just simply place new and interesting objects just outside the tank.Watch your betta investigate and react to these new phenomena.

, While tapping a fish tank is a natural human reaction, some experts say to avoid this because it can cause an unhealthy shock to your unprepared betta. Rather, trace your finger along the glass and watch for the fish to react.


Your betta will probably start coming over to your finger, and even following it as it slides along the tank wall. You might be able to get your fish to twist and loop in its pursuit.
Bettas like coming to the surface, so bobbing toys and other objects can be a good idea for playtime as well. Floating ping-pong balls can be very fun — just make sure they’re clean first.
Check out How to Play with Your Betta Fish for plenty more playtime ideas.

, As with most animals, including people for that matter, the promise of a food treat can be powerful motivation for your betta to train. With some patience and practice, your fishy friend can learn some fun tricks.


You can teach your betta to eat from your fingers by placing your digits increasingly closer to the food pellets you place in the water, until the fish takes the food right from them. Your betta may even be able to leap out of the water to take food from your fingers.The lure of food can also teach bettas to swim, or sometimes even leap, through hoops (which you can fashion out of pipe cleaners, for instance). You might also, with practice, be able to teach your fish to push that ping-pong ball it plays with into a net.

How to Play with Your Betta Fish is also a good resource for training ideas and methods.

, The best way to bond with a betta is to treat it like any other true friend. Visit when one or both of you is happy or sad, stressed out or flying high, healthy or sick. Growing a bond with any type of creature takes effort, patience, openness, and care.

Notice if your fish’s fins look clumpy or your fish is not as active as he usually is.,
Inspect your Betta fish’s eyes to see if one eye or both eyes are protruding from his head.,
Check if your fish has any protruding scales or looks bloated.,
Note if your fish is covered in white specks or spots that look like salt or sand.,
Look to see if your fish’s tail or fins are fraying or appear faded.,
Shine a flashlight on your Betta to see if his body looks gold or rusty in color.,
Check if your fish is floating on one side or is not moving at the bottom of the tank.,
Note if there are any whitish-green threads on your fish’s skin.,
Quarantine the infected Betta fish.,
Use medicated ich guard to treat ich.,
Eliminate fungus with Ampicillin or Tetracycline.,
Apply BettaZing to the tank to kill any external parasites.,
Avoid overfeeding your Betta to prevent swim bladder disorder.,
Create a Betta first aid kit.,
Do a 10-15% water change once a week or every other week, depending on your filtration kind and level.,
Add aquarium salt to remove any bacterial infections.",How to Cure Betta Fish Diseases," Your Betta may also have a paler hue than normal and white or cotton-like patches on his body. These are all signs of a fungal infection. Fungus can grow in tanks that are not treated with salt and Aquarisol once the tank water is added.The fungus can spread quickly from one infected fish to the other fish in the tank so it should be treated right away.;
, This is a symptom of a bacterial infection called popeye. Your fish may have developed popeye due to dirty tank water, or due to a more serious illness like tuberculosis. Sadly, tuberculosis is not curable in fish and is fatal for Betta fish. Tuberculosis can cause curved spines (not to be confused with the natural ""hump"" that older bettas develop). , These are symptoms of dropsy, which is a bacterial infection in your fish’s kidneys. It can cause renal failure and fluid accumulation, or bloating. It often occurs in fish that are weakened due to poor water conditions or from eating contaminated food.Once your fish suffers from kidney failure as a result of fluid buildup, your fish will likely die. You can prevent your fish from contracting dropsy by not feeding him live worms or contaminated food. Aquarium salt baths can draw out fluid, and medicines can help. Since it's hard to know what medicines are appropriate, and usually dropsy worsens quickly, painlessly euthanizing is acceptable.

, This is a sign of fish ick or ich. The spots may be slightly raised and your fish will likely scratch against objects in the tank due to irritated and itchy skin. Your fish may also have respiratory issues and appear to gasp at the surface of the tank water. Ick attacks fish that are stressed due to irregular water temperature and pH fluctuations in the water., These are all signs of a bacterial infection that causes your fish’s fins, tail and mouth to rot. Fin rot typically occurs in fish who are bullied by other fish in the tank or who are injured by a fin-nipping tank mate. A poor tank environment can also contribute to the development of fin rot. However, if your fish is a crowntail, it is natural for him/her to have a shredded looking fin.Luckily, most Betta fish can regrow their tail and fins if fin rot is treated in time. However, your Betta fish’s tail and fins may not be as vibrant as they once were when they grow back.
Some Betta fish can contract advanced body and fin rot when a case of regular fin rot goes untreated for a long period of time. Your fish may lose his fins and body tissue as the rot progresses. Once the rot eats your fish’s body tissues, it can be difficult to cure the advanced fin rot and your fish will essentially be eaten alive.

, This is a symptom of velvet, which is a parasite that is highly contagious. If your Betta has velvet, he may also clamp his fins close to his body, start to lose his color, have a lack of appetite, and may scratch against the sides of the tank or the gravel in the tank.As velvet is a highly contagious parasite, you should treat all the fish in your tank if one fish shows signs of velvet.

, These are signs of swim bladder disorder, a common illness among Betta fish. Swim bladder disorder is caused by overfeeding your Betta fish, leading to a swollen swim bladder that causes your fish to float on one side or the lie at the bottom of the tank because swimming becomes too difficult.Keep in mind swim bladder is easy to treat and does not hurt your fish, so you do not need to worry about your fish dying due to swim bladder.

, This is a symptom of anchor worms, which are small crustaceans that burrow into your fish’s skin and enter his muscles. They then release eggs in your fish before they die, leaving behind damage in your fish that can become infected.Your Betta can contract an external parasite like anchor worms due to exposure at the pet store, from his food, or from infected fish who are introduced to his tank.


Your fish may also scratch against objects to try to remove the anchor worms, and the points where the anchor worms are attached to your fish may be swollen.

, If your Betta lives with other fish in a tank, use a clean Betta fish net to remove him from the tank and place him a smaller tank with the necessary filtration system. This will then allow you to treat the water and the tank for any diseases, without harming your fish.


You should also check that the quarantine tank has the right water temperature for your Betta, between 78 degrees and 80 °F (26.7 °C)., You can find this treatment at your local pet store. You can also treat ich by raising the temperature of your tank if your tank is larger than five gallons. If your tank is smaller than five gallons, you should avoid raising the temperature as this can kill your Betta fish.Raise the tank temperature in large tank in increments to avoid shocking your Betta until it reaches 85 degrees. This will kill the ich parasite.
If you have a small tank, clean your tank completely, do a full water change and treat the water with Aquarisol and aquarium salt. You can also move your Betta fish to a temporary container and raise the temperature of the water to 85 degrees to kill any remaining ich parasites before you introduce your Betta fish back to the tank.
You can prevent the develop of ich by maintaining a consistent water temperature and cleaning the tank weekly.

, These medications can kill off the fungus and prevent your Betta from developing more fungus that can cause fin and tail rot. You should also clean the tank completely and do a complete water change. Treat the new water with ampicillin or tetracycline, as well as a fungus eliminator.You will need to do a tank cleaning and a full water change every three days, adding the medication in each water change, to kill the fungus for good. Once your Betta fish no longer appears to be losing tissue on his tail or fins, you can resume your normal tank cleaning schedule.
You can use ampicillin to also treat Popeye in your Betta. Do a tank cleaning and full water change every three days, adding ampicillin with each water change. Your fish’s Popeye symptoms should disappear within one week.

, If your fish shows any signs of an external parasite such as anchor worms or velvet, you should change out at least 70% of the tank water. You will then need to treat the remaining water with BettaZing to kill any remaining parasites and their eggs.You can purchase BettaZing at your local pet store.

, Bettas have small appetites, so you should only give your fish a small meal once a day to avoid overfeeding him. Your Betta should be able to consume all the food in his tank within two minutes of being fed. Excess food in your fish’s tank can lead to poor water quality and make your Betta more susceptible to disease.You should feed your Betta a varied, high protein diet. Look for Betta approved foods at your local pet store, as well as frozen or processed tropical fish foods.

, It’s possible your Betta will contract a disease or infection at some point in his life span, so be prepared by having medications on hand to treat your Betta quickly and efficiently. Medications can be stressful for your Betta, and should only be used when you have confirmed your Betta has a specific disease or infection and medication is necessary to treat the issue. You can find Betta first aid kits at your local pet store. Your first aid kit should contain the following medications:BettaZing or Bettamax: These medications are anti-parasitic, anti-fungal, and anti-protozoan. They are useful for a number of issues, such as fungus and velvet parasites. You can also use this medication as a preventative measure if you are trying to get a Betta used to a new environment or every time you introduce a new Betta to your tank.
Kanamycin: This antibiotic can be found at many fish stores and pet stores. It can used for serious bacterial infections.
Tetracycline: This antibiotic is used to treat less serious bacterial infections like fungus.
Ampicillin: This is a useful antibiotic for treating popeye and other infections. You can find this antibiotic in specialty fish stores and online.
Jungle Fungus Eliminator: This is an anti-fungal treatment that works on several fungus infections and is useful to keep on hand as a Betta fish owner.
Maracin 1 and Maracin 2: These medications come in hard tablet form and can be used to treat mild infections like fin and tail rot. However, the are not as effective as other medications to treat more serious infections.

, This will help to remove any waste buildup and any decaying organic matter from excess food and dead leaves or roots from plants. Doing a small partial water change weekly will also clean any toxins from the water and keep the water clean.Do not remove any of the aquarium plants or decorations from the tank or bowl. Removing or cleaning these items can kill the good bacteria that has been filtering through your tank and reduce the quality of your filtration system. As well, you do not need to remove your fish from the tank or bowl when you do a partial water change. This can stress out your fish and could expose him to harmful bacteria.You can use a siphon to suck up any gunk in the gravel and decorations. You should also use an algae scraper to remove algae on the surface of the tank or the tank ornaments before you remove any of the water.If your tank does not have a filter, start with clean water and test daily for ammonia. When the kit says there is ammonia, it's time for a water change. Getting a top cover for the bowl or a filter can reduce the water changes you will need to do and protect your fish from getting an infection or a disease.Check the water once a day to ensure it is not cloudy, foamy, or has an unusual odor. These could all be signs of a bacterial bloom and may require you to do a full water change.Doing this will prevent your Betta from developing any diseases or infections.

, Bacterial infections like fin and tail rot can be prevented by adding aquarium salt to your tank water. Unlike table salt, aquarium salt does not contain any additives like iodine or calcium silicate. (Don't use table salt!) Do not use Aquarium Salt or copper-based medicines if your tank also includes Mystery Snails, Apple Snails, Cory Cats or Corydoras, as they can not handle these medicines and may die. Nerite snails are salt-tolerant, however they may not be able to handle copper, so proceed carefully.Always follow the instructions on the package for dosage amounts. Usually, manufacturers recommend one tablespoon of aquarium salt per five gallons of aquarium water.

Return the betta fish to its bowl.",How to Clean a Betta Fish Bowl," The main way to keep a fish bowl clean is to change some of the water in it. However, this process can stress or even kill the fish by disrupting the bacterial and chemical contents of the water. Follow this guide to keep your bowl contents healthy without changing the water unnecessarily often:


Clean 0.5 gallon (2 liter) bowls daily, 1.5 gal. (6 L) bowls twice a week, and bowls 3 gal. (12 L) and up once a week.
If your bowl has a water filter, you can wait twice as long between cleanings.;
, During the cleaning and water change, you'll remove about 20%–25% of the water in your fish bowl. The replacement water should be prepared at least 30 minutes in advance, to allow time for treatments to work. You may use tap water, distilled water, or rainwater, but be sure to follow the advice below to make it safe for your betta. Leave this out at room temperature in a clean, soap-free container while you clean the tank.


Do not use rainwater in an area with acid rain.

, This is sold at pet stores as ""dechlorination tablets"" or ""water conditioner,"" and are used to break down chlorine and other chemicals harmful to fish. Add this to the tap water, following the instructions to treat the amount of new water you are adding. This usually takes at least 30 minutes to take effect.


Skip this step if using distilled water or rainwater.

, Aquarium salts for betta fish or goldfish can be added in small amounts as instructed on the packaging. This can help the fish thrive, but is not necessary to survival. This step is recommended if the fish has patchy, diseased skin, or if the water in the bowl is 100% distilled water.

, Betta fish are tropical fish, and prefer temperatures around 74–82–F (23-28ºC), or just a little warmer than ""room temperature."" If the new water is not near this temperature, or if it feels colder or warmer than the water in the fishbowl, leave it in a warm room until it reaches a safe temperature.

, Wash your hands to remove traces of dirt and soap before cleaning the tank. Do not use soap to wash your hands, as soap can harm or kill your fish.

, Leaving the betta in the tank is usually best for the fish. However, if the fish bowl is too small to easily reach in and clean without hitting the fish or blocking its access to the air, move the fish before cleaning. Transfer some water from the fish bowl to a clean, soap-free container, then use a fishnet to transfer the betta.


Leave at least 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) of space above the water level in the new container, so the betta cannot jump out.

, Even tiny traces of soap or other substances can harm your fish. Use a brand new sponge, or a cloth that has recently been through a washing and rinsing cycle and not used for any purpose since then. Rub the inside of the bowl in circular motions to remove slime and dirt.


A sponge attached to a handle may be the easiest tool to use.
You can use the same sponge to clean off rocks and other decorations too.

, Use a siphon, bucket, or cup, making sure the tool is clean and soap-free, to remove about a fifth of the water from the fish bowl. You may use this in the garden, or dump it down a drain.

, If the outside of the bowl is dusty or grimy, you may clean it with any ordinary sponge or cloth. You may use Windex, soap, or other cleaning products, as long as you are careful not to let any of it drip inside the bowl.

, Only use water carefully selected or prepared with the instructions in the preparation section. If the fish is in the bowl, pour the water in slowly to avoid disturbing the fish with strong currents.

, If you removed the betta fish for cleaning, use a fishnet to transfer it back into the bowl. If you are worried that the water temperature has changed, or if you accidentally changed more than 50% of the water, instead transfer the fish and the water it's swimming in to a small plastic bag. Float this bag on the surface of the bowl for 15–20 minutes, then let the fish swim into the bowl and remove the bag.

, You do not need to do a major cleaning unless the bowl has developed slime or grime you cannot scrub off, or if the water has become permanently cloudy. The more involved the cleaning is, and the more water you replace, the more stressed your fish will be. If the fish bowl is an adequate size for your betta fish, at least 3 gal. (6 L), you will only need to clean it this way once or twice a year.

, You'll be replacing about 50% of the water in the fish bowl. Use tap water treated with dechlorination tablets, freshly collected rainwater, or distilled water treated with aquarium salts. Check the water temperature to make sure it matches the water in the fish bowl.


See the preparation section for more information on preparing aquarium water.

, Move roughly 50% of the water in the fish bowl to another container. Even if the water looks filthy, do not transfer your betta to a container of new water. The shock could kill it.


Keeping the old water also insures that you will still have useful bacteria in your fish bowl, which will break down otherwise harmful chemicals produced by your fish's waste.

, Separate out any gravel, pebbles and decorations by pouring the water through a sieve standing on a bucket, or by scooping them out with a cup. Dump the remaining water into your garden or down a drain. If your bowl is too heavy to handle easily, use a siphon hose instead to transfer the water to a bucket in stages.

, Rinse all gravel, pebbles, and decorations once in a basin of hot water to remove as much grime as possible. Pour out the hot water and rinse a second time in cool or room temperature water. Rub them with your fingers or your dedicated aquarium sponge while rinsing the second time.

, If water and elbow grease alone won't remove the gunk on the fish bowl, wet a cloth with white vinegar and scrub the sides. Always thoroughly rinse the vinegar in room temperature water after the fish bowl is clean.


Never use any soap, cleaning products, or any substance besides water or vinegar to clean your fish bowl.

, Return the gravel, pebbles, and/or decoration to the fish bowl. Pour in the newly prepared water. Pour in most of the old water, but leave enough in the temporary container for your betta to swim. Wait for the clouds and gravel to subside to the bottom if necessary.

, Because of the major changes to the bowl, introducing your fish slowly is recommended. Float the betta fish and the water it's been swimming in inside a small plastic bag, on top of the bowl water. After 15 minutes, pour a little of the bowl water into the bag. After 30 minutes, let the betta swim out of the bag into the rest of the bowl, and remove the bag.

, Make sure you only microwave your pea for only 30-60 seconds., Once you got the pea out, you can use a pair of tweezer and remove the skin part of the pea. You won't feed the skin part of the pea to your Betta, so you can dispose of it., You will not need a lot because if you did get a lot, your Betta fish will become more bloated., You can use a net or something of that sort.

Separate if it does not work out.",How to Choose Fish That Are Compatible with Male Bettas," If you are considering a tank of many different species of fish, you will want to form what is known as a ""community tank"". This will require selecting fish (or other aquatic species) that are not typically aggressive against each other. Better aquarium stores on on-line guides can help you choose what works for you. Here are a few of the many:


Corydoras (or cory catfish)
Ghost shrimp
Plecos (Although non-aggressive and algae eaters, these fish will eventually grow very large)
Loaches (these have the same issues at plecos)
African dwarf frogs;
, Here are some things to be aware of when selecting a new companion:


Never choose fin-nippers like tiger barbs. They will destroy your betta's beautiful fins.
Make sure that the fish do not resemble male bettas, like male guppies with long, flowing tails. Though guppies are peaceful, a male betta may mistake him for another betta, and attack.
Make sure that the fish have the same, or very similar, water and heat requirements.
Avoid fish that give off a lot of ammonia, like goldfish. Too much ammonia will damage your betta's health.
Make sure they are large enough not to get eaten by your betta. Some baby fish may be mistaken for snacks.

, Take size and care requirements into consideration before choosing.

, Consider the following:


Check that the tank is large enough for more than one fish. The key is 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fish per gallon.
Examine your betta to make sure it is not sick before adding any more fish. It should be swimming normally, be free of spots, fuzzy areas, or any abnormalities. Many betta diseases are contagious to other fish.

, This will help to ensure that your betta will not be too territorial.


Do a complete water change, change the gravel, and rearrange the decorations if necessary.
Remove any sharp decorations, such as very sharp rocks or artificial plants. Betta tails are long, flowing, and somewhat delicate. They can snag on these things and cause tears.

, He will be more likely to attack if he has a trespasser in his territory.

, This helps the fish get used to the new water temperature because a new temperature may cause ultra-sensitive fish stress, and sometimes even death.

, Let in some of the new water. This lets the fish get used to the new water. Do not dump the fish in. Let them swim into the tank by themselves.

, Allow it to become settled before adding in your betta.

, Make sure your new fish is not aggressive towards your betta, tries to nip his fins, or cause him harm.

, Watch them for a very long time, and try not to leave them unattended for long.

, If your betta tries to hurt your new fish, it is best to catch the new fish and bring them to safety in a separate tank.


Many pet stores allow you to return fish before a time limit. Try to return the fish.
Or keep it separated from your betta with a divider, sold at most aquarium stores.
Alternatively, provide a separate tank. Betta fish evolved to survive in low-oxygen, small aquatic environments. Therefore, they do not require large or even filtered aquariums. Betta tanks are sold at most aquarium supply stores that require space or upkeep. Homemade betta tanks are easy to construct, as well.

Prepare the new water.Fill a large, clean container with fresh water.,
Allow the water to warm up.,
Remove some water from your betta’s current container.,
Refill your betta’s container.,
Repeat water changes frequently.",How to Change Your Betta Fish Water1," Leave your betta’s current container alone for now. Use a water conditioner (available at pet supply stores) to remove chlorine and other harmful substances from the fresh water.


Follow all directions provided with the water conditioner, and use the exact amount required for your tank or bowl size.;
, Putting your betta immediately into water that is a different temperature can harm it.Let the container of fresh, treated water sit at room temperature for an hour so that it will be safe and comfortable for your fish.


Alternatively, you can mix hot and cold water from your tap until it is the same temperature as the water in your betta’s current container.If you follow this method, use an aquarium thermometer to make sure that the water in both tanks is the same temperature, and add water conditioner to the new water as instructed.

, To do a partial water change, you will take some of the water from your betta’s container and replace it with some of the fresh, treated water. Using a clean scoop or something similar, remove 25 to 50 percent of the water in your betta’s current container.Leave your betta in the container as you remove the water.


To be precise, you can measure the water as you take it out. For instance, if you have a twenty-gallon tank, remove up to ten gallons measured using jugs or other measuring containers.
You can also use a siphon hose to transfer water from your betta’s container to a bucket or sink. Once the water starts flowing, move the hose so it ""vacuums"" the gravel at the bottom of the tank, picking up fish waste, old food, and other debris.

, Slowly pour fresh, treated water from the container you prepared into your betta’s current container until it reaches the previous water level.If the container is too heavy to lift and pour, use a clean scoop (or similar container) or siphon hose to add the water. It is fine to leave your betta in its container as you add the fresh water, but add the water slowly so that you do not disturb the fish.

, Most experts recommend changing your betta’s water at least once a week.If for some reason your betta’s container becomes especially dirty, however, you may need to change it more frequently.

, Using a fish net, remove your betta from its current container to the container filled with fresh water.Be very gentle when moving your fish, as its fins are very susceptible to injury.

, Gently clean the container itself, using only water and a clean, soft cloth or sponge; soaps and other products can harm your fish. Make sure to sift the tank’s gravel to remove waste, food debris, etc.

, Take some of the fresh water from the container your betta is currently in, and pour it into its container.Pour enough so that your betta will be able to move comfortably in its container.

, Using a fish net, move your betta from the holding tank back to its container, now partially filled with fresh water.As before, be very gentle when moving your fish.

, Take the rest of the fresh water from the holding tank and very slowly pour it into your betta’s container. If the container is too heavy to lift and pour, use a clean scoop (or similar container) or siphon hose to add the water. It is important to pour very slowly so that you do not disturb your fish., Most of the time, partial water changes are all that are needed for a betta's container.Complete a full water change, however, if the container becomes dirty all over.

Properly feed your fish.,
Provide the best quality water for your fish.",How to Take Care of Your Carnival Goldfish," You will need specific equipment and tank dimensions to properly house your goldfish. By providing the right environment for your goldfish, you will help your new friend to be comfortable and healthy in its new home.For the aquarium itself, you should try to find one that is around 20 gallons (76 L) in size. This may seem large for your new fish, but remember, it will grow over time. Bowls, contrary to popular belief, are potentially lethal to goldfish.
You will need both a water filter and an air pump. Sometimes these are combined into one device. You will also need to buy filters for the water filter itself.
Additional items will include a stand and cover for the tank. These help keep the fish safe and secure in its new home.
Make sure you find a compatible UV light for the tank. This is important because not all reptile UV units are safe to use near water. Some filters or covers come with a light built in. However, if your cover doesn't include a light you will need to add a separate one. Run the light for 12 hours a day.
Inside the tank you will want to place both sand, along the bottom, and then decorations to sit on the sand. Gravel and larger rocks can be dangerous as goldfish may accidentally swallow them and possibly perish. Also, the larger gaps between pieces of gravel trap poop which is quite unsanitary for your new pet.
Finally, you will want to purchase fish food. These are found in pet stores and usually come in the form of flakes.;
, Before you start assembling your aquarium, you will need to take a few steps to make sure it is a safe and healthy place for your new fish. Make sure you do the following before adding any water or your fish:Wash and rinse the tank, decorations, and gravel to make sure they are clean. Don't use any soap or detergents.
Put the aquarium in a safe and stable place in your home. Once you fill the tank with water, it will be very heavy. So make sure to select a location where you'd like to house the tank long-term. The surface you set the tank on should also be stable and strong enough to hold the tank when full of water.

, After you have cleaned the tank and the items that will go into it, you can start putting them into the tank. Have fun decorating the tank and setting it up to be a great and safe place for your fish to live.Place the gravel first, covering the bottom of the tank.
Add your decorations next. Have fun making the tank look interesting to you.

, After you have cleaned and arranged the tank to your liking, it's time to add the water. Pour the water in slowly to avoid disrupting your arrangement or stirring up the gravel at the bottom of the tank.The water should be room temperature, around 65° to 75°F.
Add a dechlorinator to the water to remove harmful chlorine from the water.

, Once the tank is full with clean, room temperature water, you can add your filter and air pump. Some filters may also function as an air pump, in which case you will not need both.Your filter will help keep the water clean and free of waste produced by your fish.
Air pumps, and some filters, will add oxygen to the fish's water, which it needs to breathe.

, Turn on the filters, air pumps and lights to make sure everything in the tank is running properly. Leave the filters and air pumps on to prepare the water before adding your fish. Keep an eye on the temperature to make sure it remains between 65° to 75°F.

, If you drop your fish into the new tank water without letting it acclimate, the fish may become shocked and die. There are differences in the quality of the water that your fish will be sensitive to. Give the fish time to acclimate properly before adding it to the tank.Add 2 cups of tank water to the bag that your fish is in.
Add another 2 cups of tank water to the fish's bag every five minutes.
Stop when you have added 8 cups of tank water to your fish's bag.
If you want to (and can), you can use drip acclimation for about 30 minutes to an hour.
Carefully net your fish and add it to the tank. Dumping the fish and bag water into the tank can also dump any waste the fish may have released.

, Caring for any pet will require you to feed it a balanced and nutritious diet. By receiving such a diet, your fish will stay happy and healthy. Try including some of the following elements in your fish's diet.Carbohydrates can be provided by some aquatic plants. Most sources in prepared fish food come from wheat, oats, soy beans and rice.
Oils and fats are necessary in your fish's diet. Try to provide food with a range of 3-10% fat content, as too much fat can cause health problems.
Protein is used to repair and maintain tissues and cells in the body. Most fish flake formulas include protein from other fish, shrimp, algae or soy beans.
Your fish will also need small amounts of vitamins and minerals.

, Even though you may have food to feed your fish, you still need to feed it the right amounts and at the right times of day. Use the following guidelines to ensure that your fish is getting the most out of its food.Feed your fish twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening.
Feed your fish only what it can fully consume over the span of three minutes.

, The water your fish lives in will have to be properly maintained to help keep the fish as healthy as it can be. Dirty or unhealthy water can cause your fish to become sick or even die. Keep track of and maintain the following aspects of your fish's water.Keep the water oxygenated. Despite living in water, your fish still breathes oxygen.
You will need an air pump and an air stone for your tank in order to oxygenate your water. Adding plants can help as well.
Some water filters will have an air pump built in. If yours does, you won't need to buy a separate air pump or air stone.
Monitor the temperature of the water. Fish are unable to control their own body temperature and rely on the temperature of the water to survive.
Place the tank in an area that keeps the water temperature at between 65° to 75°F.
The final level that needs to be maintained is the pH level. The pH level lets you know how acidic or basic the water is. Usually this level is the least of your worries, so check that every other parameter is acceptable first.
Your fish will do best with a pH between 6.5 to 8.

Consider the size of your fish tank.,
Decorate your fish tank.,
Use a filtration system.,
Add conditioned water.,
Allow the water to acquire healthy bacteria before adding fish.,
Change the tank’s water once a week.,
Cycle the fish tank’s water once a month.,
Select your fish tank’s occupant.,
Show the fish its new home.,
Feed your goldfish like it’s your only friend.",How to Set up a Fish Tank (for Goldfish)," Goldfish require particularly roomy living arrangements in order to stay healthy. While they are pretty small fish, they need larger tanks than you might expect.


You can do better than a bowl. Despite the beauty of a goldfish suspended in a sphere of glass, most fishbowls simply don’t provide enough room for their occupants.
A single fancy goldfish can be kept in a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank, but bigger goldfish like comets need a tank of around 50 gallons (189.3 L).
If you are able to keep one goldfish from overthrowing your empire, and wish to allow them a friend with which to endure their captivity, you’re going to need to increase the capacity of your fish tank (by roughly 10 gallon (37.9 L)) for each additional fish.
A 20 gallon (75.7 L) is ideal for your first goldfish, and can ultimately hold 2-3 fancy goldfish.;
, Most goldfish favor a palace or castle ambiance. Shoot for somewhere in between. Gravel is a must, and plants are recommended. That said, your selection of décor, gravel, and plants must follow certain guidelines:Choose a goldfish appropriate gravel. Don’t actually use pieces of gold, as these will likely be dangerously small. Goldfish are scavengers. They will pick up pieces of gravel and mess around with them just for fun. Use gravel that is made up of pieces that are too large for the fish to swallow.
Definitely hook your goldfish up with ample rocks, caves, or plants. Goldfish like to adventure, and can easily be fooled into thinking they’re not in a fish tank.
Don’t use wood. It looks spectacular, but will color your water and, depending on the type of wood, will dissolve.
Be aware that some rocks and sea shells will affect the pH of the water. If you’re adding stuff you find on the beach willy-nilly, you’re going to need to be checking your pH frequently.
Only put certain plants in your goldfish tank. Goldfish, interestingly, are pretty aggressive with plants. Some plants are better able to defend themselves:

Try Vallisneria types, different Hygrophilas, Red Bacopa or even Ludwigia Arcuata.



, A filter is an absolutely necessary component of your fish tank. Filters operate according to flow rate, with certain filters designed for certain sized tanks, so make sure you get the right filter for a tank your size. There are two types to choose from.External filters rest on the exterior of your tank, while internal filters are submerged within the tank. Either type of filter can work for a goldfish tank.
External filters are generally considered to be superior, as they have a greater capacity to store filtration materials and can accordingly clean water more thoroughly. .
If you have a 20 gallon (75.7 L) tank, shoot for a filter rated for 40 gallons (151.4 L).

, You can use tap water to fill your tank, but you need to add conditioner to make it safe for your goldfish. At minimum, you need a conditioner that neutralizes chlorine and chloramine.Aside from removing any harmful chemicals in tap water with conditioner, you’ll also need to make sure the water has the right pH level for gold fish, which is a slightly alkaline 7-7.5 pH. Use a pH test kit to periodically test your water, and adjust the pH if necessary.
Take tank placement seriously. Do not place the tank near a window or any heating or cooling source. Do not allow sunlight to hit the tank directly. Also be sure the tank is set on something flat and extremely sturdy.You likely don’t need a heater. The fish tank’s water temperature should be between 60 °F (16 °C) and 72 °F (22 °C), so the ambient temperature of your living space should work., When you first set up your fish tank, you’re going to need to let the water sit for at least a few weeks before showing the place to any prospective goldfish occupants. This time is necessary to help build up beneficial bacteria, a process outlined in this section. Be patient during this process!

, Let’s face it: goldfish poop a lot. And they hate swimming around in their own poop. You would too. Their poop will build up dramatically in your fish tank’s water (even with plenty of water changes), which will both enrage and sicken your goldfish. To curb this buildup, change 25-50% of the tank’s water once a week.When changing some of the tank’s water, rinse the filter and any tank décor with water your remove from the tank. Never use tap water. Healthy bacteria that you want to preserve live on and in these items.
Only add clean water that you’ve treated with conditioner.

, You also need to regularly cycle the fish tank, which means changing 100% of the tank’s water. The goal in cycling your fish tank is to allow it to rebuild colonies of helpful bacteria, which collect mostly on the filter and in the gravel. These bacteria help your water cycle nitrogen, which is necessary to keep your fish alive.Once your tank is setup and ready to go, with the filter running, add ammonia. Continue adding ammonia until enough bacteria have developed to eat both the ammonia and nitrites in your tank.
There are various forms of ammonia, which is most readily available in bottled form. Follow the directions on the bottle.
Determine your levels of ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates by using test kits designed for this purpose.
Maintain the process until you get readings that indicate zero ammonia and zero nitrite. Once you also find a bit of nitrate in the water (which is produced by the bacteria), your tank has been successfully cycled.

, Look for a healthy, handsome fish. Don’t choose a fish from an aquarium in which there are also sickly or dead fish. You want a fish that looks like they’re aware of their surroundings, actively moves around, nibbles on stuff, and generally acts like a boss.Gaze into the fish’s eyes. Seriously. Goldfish eyes should be clear, not foggy.
Check out the fish’s fins and body. You want erect, non-ragged fins on your fish. Saggy or messed up fins often indicate ill health. Similarly, don’t choose a fish with white spots, fuzzy patches, or red streaks.
Once the match has been made, get your fish into a plastic bag filled with water from the tank from which it came. Place the plastic bag inside a paper bag so the journey to its new home will not traumatize it.

, But don’t hurry the process. Float the bag for fifteen minutes or so in your tank to let the fish slowly acclimate to any temperature difference. At about the five minute mark, allow some of the tanks water into the bag, but don’t let any of the bagged water into the tank.Do not pour the fish and the bagged water into your tank. Instead, gently scoop the fish out of the bag with a net and submerge the net in the tank slowly, letting the fish swim out of the net on its own.
Turn off the lights and leave the room. Give your new goldfish some peace and quiet to encounter their new living space.
Add a fish tank additive called stress coat to the water to minimize the chances of your fish becoming ill from the change in environment.

, There are a lot of different options. Get whichever you want; Preparation is more important. If the food is dry (most goldfish food is), soak it in water from the tank for a minute before feeding your fish. Un-soaked food can injure or sicken the fish when it expands in the stomach.


Fish food should sink, or be suspended in the water. Food that floats risks giving the fish swim bladder issues.
Feed your fish once a day, six days a week. On the seventh day, your gold fish needs to rest."

Figure out your budget.,
Go to the pet store!

,
Pick out the tank you had in mind.,
Don't forget to get a heater, substrate (sand/gravel), hiding places, plants, and gravel vacuum for your finned friend.,
After your tank has fully cycled, go get a betta fish at the pet store!,
Get some betta food while you're at it.,
Acclimate your new fish to his tank!,
Remember to change his water and feed him!",How to Choose a Home for a Betta Fish," Do you have enough money for a 3 gallon (11.4 L) tank or a 15-gallon? Keep a heater, filter, lid, decorations, and other necessities in mind.;
,, Many betta fish experts say a 3 gallon (11.4 L) bowl/tank is the minimum, with 5 gallons being even better.


The ""one inch of fish per gallon"" rule applies here. That means a 3 gallon is efficient for one adult betta.
Please do not put your fish in a vase with a plant and expect it to eat the roots. Bettas are insectivores and will die of starvation.

,


A filter is a must! Although some people say bettas don't need filters, they keep the water cleaner and house most of the beneficial bacteria that will keep toxin levels lower.






Go home and set up the tank. Now you're ready to cycle the tank! It takes two weeks to a month to get an aquarium ready for fish. Drop some fish food to create ammonia for the denitrifying bacteria to feed off of. Read up on the nitrogen cycle in home aquaria!

, Betta fish can be as little as a dollar up to thirty dollars at the pet store.

,


Try to provide a variety of high-quality pellets, frozen, freeze-dried, and live foods. You may have to experiment- Some bettas are very picky! High-quality pellets have minimal meal ingredients and more whole ones. Omega One and New Life Spectrum are both good brands. Most bettas enjoy frozen bloodworms as a treat, though limit it to up to two days a week.

, Don't just drop Mr. Fishy in his new home! Float the cup or bag in the water for twenty minutes and slowly add some of the tank water into it.

,


Tanks 10 gallon (37.9 L) and under should recieve a 25% water change every week. Aquariums 10 gallon (37.9 L) and larger can wait two weeks before requiring a partial water change.

Visit a reputable breeder.,
Find a wild breed.,
Sex your Betta fish.,
Purchase two pair of bettas.,
Keep them separated.,
Fatten up your Betta fish.,
Let your Betta fish get to know each other.,
Put them in the same tank.,
Remove the female immediately after mating.,
Remove the male.,
Feed the fry.,
Clean the water frequently.,
Maintain a stable water temperature.,
Separate fry after about two months.",How to Breed Wild Bettas," Pet stores are often unsanitary and sell Betta fish too old to breed. Visit a breeder and ask a lot of questions. Try to determine how well the breeder understands the genetics of its Betta fish. If she seems knowledgeable, ask for suggestions about picking good pairs.


While it is tempting to pick out fish that are bigger and brighter, these are often older, which will make it more difficult to breed them.;
, Wild Betta fish are less aggressive than their domesticated peers and so can more easily be kept in the same tank and bred. Because many of these species are endangered, many hobbyists also like to keep and breed them to ensure their survival. If you want a wild Betta fish find one from one of the following complexes:


Akarensis
Albimarginata
Bellica
Coccina
Foerschi
Picta
Pugnax
Splendens
Unimaculata
Waseri

, You will want to get a combination of males and females. Males have more and brighter colors than females. Females have shorter fins and egg spots on the bottom of their bellies. These spots might look like small grains of salt.Be sure that the male is at least as large as its female companion, preferably a bit larger., Unfortunately, not all bettas will get along or make it to mating age. You should have two pair in case one does not work out. Purchase them all at the same time, so that they will be off approximately the same age.


For optimal results when breeding, it is typically best to mate two fish with similar color patterns. Try to purchase four fish that are of a similar breed, possibly even of the same family., Bettas are an aggressive species. With some exceptions, Betta fish have difficulty being in a bowl together. In general, you should keep them in separate aquariums.When you are prepared to breed them, it is imperative that it be in a tank that is at least 20-gallons large, with no other fish.Wild Betta breeds are less aggressive and can often be kept together. Domesticated species were typically bred to be fighting fish and are thus highly aggressive. Wild breeds are more sedate, but you should still be careful when introducing wild bettas to each other.Females Betta fish are also less aggressive than their male counterparts. They will chase other bettas, but they are less likely to bite and seriously injure each other. You can keep as many as three female Betta fish in a single tank, though you should monitor their behavior to ensure that their aggression does not escalate.Male Betta fish can be kept in a large tank with fish of other species, especially if they have different color patterns.When you are ready to breed your bettas, however, they will need a separate tank for themselves. Only the male and the female can be in the tank with the fry, and even they can only be there for a brief period of time.

, Your bettas will become more likely to breed when you fatten them up. For about a two-week period, switch from pelleted food to a wide variety of live foods. Try brine shrimp, black worms, tubifex worms, and daphnias.Feed a variety of foods, two to four times a day.


You can recognize when a female is getting ready to breed because she will get larger. You might even be able to see the eggs growing underneath her skin.Vertical stripes might also appear on her body.Well conditioned males, on the other hand, will begin to produce bubble nests. These are small collections of bubbles which should accumulate on the top of the water, near the edge of the tank.
Live feed should be available at most pet stores.
You should aim to feed the fish as much as they can take. If any food remains in the tank after five minutes, you have fed them too much. Clean out any renaming food to prevent contamination of the aquarium., While conditioning your bettas, place a male and female couple where they can see each other without being able to interact. This can either be in two separate tanks adjacent to one another, or in the same tank, with a glass divider.You should move the fish close to each other at around the same time that you begin feeding them more heavily. Doing both of these two things simultaneously will effectively send your bettas the message that they should prepare to mate.

, Place the female betta into the male betta’s tank. The two will likely nip at one another; do not separate them unless it looks like they are causing serious harm. Eventually the male should take the female to the bubble nest where the two will embrace each other until mating is over.


The mating process will take about an hour or two. The male will take the female to his bubble nest and the female will release eggs into it. The two fish should interact with each other throughout the process. Once it is over, the male will scare the female away.
Rather than putting the female in the male's tank, you can transfer them both to a new tank. After the breeding process, you will need to remove the male from the aquarium with its fry (baby fish), thus making it possibly advantageous to return him to the tank he is accustomed to. However, the male needs to spend at least a week in the aquarium before the mating process to create a bubble nest in the tank.

, After mating is complete, the male will scare away the female. Remove the female from the tank immediately to prevent further injury. Try to take precautions to prevent infection.When you remove the female from the tank with the male, put her in an aquarium that has been treated with a disinfectant like Betamax. She has likely been injured during the mating process and you should do what you can to prevent infection., Approximately three days after the mating process is complete, the fry should eat up the remainder of their egg sacks and you should see them begin to swim around slightly. At this point, you should try to lure the male away from its fry and use a soft net to lift him out of the aquarium.You should lure the male away from the fry so that you do not accidentally net and remove any of the fry.
The male has, like the female, probably sustained injury during the mating process. Therefore, you should treat its aquarium with Betamax to prevent infection., You will want to progress to feeding your fry larger foods as they mature. After they finish consuming their yolk sack and begin moving you can feed them them vinegar eels, and then, after three day more days, brine shrimp. From then on, alternate between feeding them brine shrimp and microworms.Through this process, you will be giving your betta fry progressively larger feed. They will have difficult consuming large food at first, which is why you start them off with vinegar eels. As they grow, you can move on to brine shrimp and microworms.
Do not try to feed fry flakes. You should only use live feed.Live feed is available at most pet stores and can be ordered online.
Stick to small portions. Feeding the fry too much can pollute the tank with leftovers and can detrimentally effect their health. If any food is remaining after five minutes, feed the fry less food next time., Fry tend to rapidly pollute the water until it becomes unsustainable. You should purchase a testing kit and use it regularly to be sure that ammonia and nitrate levels reach no higher than 0. You might need to replace small amounts of water, about 5% of the tank, daily.


Filtration systems can be harmful to fry when they are young and vulnerable. Because of that, you will need to rely on changing the water by hand to keep the tank hospitable to vulnerable fry., Keep the temperature in the tank stable at around 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep the aquarium away from windows, heater, vents, or other household items that could cause the temperature to fluctuate., Because of their aggressive nature, betta fish cannot live together indefinitely. After about two months they should be transferred to separate tanks. Watch to see if they have begun to fight or if males have developed larger fins than the females. These are indications that they are mature and should be separated.If you are successful, you'll probably have more betta fish than you can manage after this process. Consider selling some to a pet store or look for buyers online. Some fish might also have deformities and can be culled to prevent further deformities."

Separate infected goldfish from healthy ones.",How to Save a Dying Goldfish," If you have a sick goldfish, it’s important to separate him from any other goldfish so that he doesn’t transmit any potential diseases. If you only have one goldfish, leave him in his tank.


If you move a sick goldfish to a “hospital” tank, transport him in plastic bag that is inside of a paper bag so that your goldfish doesn’t get stressed.
You may want to fill the water in the new tank with water from the old tank, though if the water is causing your fish to die, this may exacerbate the problem.If you place the fish in new water, simply put the plastic bag into the water for 15-20 minutes to help the temperature adjust and not shock your fish.;
, Most dying fish can be easily revived with changes to the water. Maintaining water quality is essential to keeping your fish happy and healthy—and alive.You can buy a fish tank water testing kit at most pet stores.These tests can help you identify any problems with the water, such as high ammonia.
Test the temperature to make sure it is between 50 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit.Test the water for acidity. Most fish thrive at a neutral pH level of approximately 7.If the water is too acidic, you can buy a chemical neutralizer at most pet stores.Test for oxygenation to help ensure that the saturation exceeds 70%., Goldfish produce a lot of waste and the tank water can quickly become dirty and filled with ammonia or bacteria and algae. Simply cleaning the tank and changing the water may help immediately save your fish.


Put your goldfish in a separate tank while cleaning and replacing the water.
You should clean the tank once a week to keep it from forming bacteria.
Remove 15% of the water, all of the gravel, and any algae you find.
Don’t use any chemicals in the water. Simply cleaning off gravel and any chemicals that have evaporated on the sides of the tank is sufficient.Small amounts of chemicals or soap can kill fish.
Fill the tank with fresh, clean, and cold tap water. Add a dechlorinator to the new water to remove excess chlorine.

, After you’ve cleaned the tank and changed the water, observe your goldfish for a few days to see if this measure revives him. This may help you pinpoint what was or is ailing your goldfish.


You may see immediate results, such as if the tank didn’t have enough oxygen, or it may take a couple of days for your goldfish to adjust to the new tank and water.
Wait a day or two before trying other treatments to help ensure that you don’t treat your goldfish for an illness it doesn’t have, possibly causing it harm.

, There are many different symptoms of illness in goldfish. Identifying the symptoms properly and early can help you save your goldfish from dying.The best time to check for signs of disease or death is before feeding.Breathing disorders: look for symptoms such as gasping for air, rapid breathing, skimming the surface of the tank water, or lying at the bottom of the tank, which may indicate disease or poor quality water.Internal parasites: goldfish are naturally very hungry and if you notice that your fish isn’t eating or is losing weight, it might indicate internal parasites.Swim bladder disease: see if your fish is swimming erratically, upside down, or rubbing up against surfaces it may indicate everything from bladder disease to improper feeding.Fungal disease: if your goldfish exhibits symptoms such as folded or torn fins, discolored spots, lumps or bumps, protruding eyes, pale gills, or is bloated, these can be signs of fungal disease.Fin rot: this is one of the most common fungal diseases in fish and presents with symptoms such as milky white areas on the fins or tail and a ragged appearance of the fins., Once you’ve identified symptoms of a dying goldfish, see if any other fish in the tank are suffering from similar signs. This may help you identify what the underlying cause of your goldfish’s illness is.

, You can treat diseases such as fungal infections and tail rot by removing the tank filter properly and treating the water. This may help save your fish from dying.Remove the active carbon filters in the tank and use commercial treatments such as Maracyn-Two for fin rot or methylene blue for fungal infections.If you aren’t sure whether your fish has a fungal infection or tail rot, don’t use this treatment. Using chemicals to address a problem that doesn’t exist can seriously harm your goldfish., If you notice that you fish have white spots on their bodies, they likely have a disease caused by ich parasites or they may also have anchor worms or lice. Using a heat and salt method can help treat the disease and save your goldfish.Slowly raise the temperature of your aquarium to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsuis) over a 48 hour period to stop the ich parasites from reproducing.Keep the tank at this temperature for 10 days.Add one tablespoon of aquarium salt for every 5 gallons of water.Change the tank water every couple of days.Reduce the water temperature gradually back to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsuis).You may use the heat and salt method if there are healthy fish in the tank. This may also help remove single parasites that have infected healthy fish., Some fish may have swim bladder disease that is not helped by changing the tank water. Feeding your fish veggies, such as frozen peas, and low protein food may help alleviate a swim bladder disease.Frozen peas are a good choice because they’re rich in fiber and they sink to the tank and your goldfish won’t have to search for it at the surface.Don’t overfeed your sick fish. Only give them new food when they’ve finished their last feeding. Not following this could cause an ammonia problem in the tank and make the fish even sicker., If you notice your goldfish has parasites such as anchor worms, you may be able to excise the parasites with tweezers. Be sure to do this gently so that you don’t harm or kill your goldfish.


Some parasites burrow deeply into fish. You may want to combine excision with killing off parasites with a commercial treatment.
Make sure to grip the parasite as closely to the wound on your fish as possible to help ensure you remove the entire parasite.
Place your goldfish in the water every minute or so he can catch his breath.
It may take a few weeks for parasites to disappear from your tank.
Only use this method if you’re sure your goldfish has worms or parasites and if you can handle them gently enough to not kill the fish.

, If you’re not sure what is ailing your fish, try using a commercial fish medication to treat any illness. This may save your fish from any diseases or parasites.You can get commercial fish medication at most pet stores and even some larger retail stores.
Be aware that commercial fish medications are not regulated by government agencies, which means the treatments may be useless or could harm your fish. The best treatment is always being sure of the disease for which you’re treating., You might find that home treatments don’t cure your fish. If this is the case, take the fish to the vet. He may be able to identify why your goldfish is showing the symptoms of dying and develop a treatment plan.


Make sure to transport your fish in a plastic bag that is covered by a paper bag so that she doesn’t get stressed.
Be aware that a vet might not be able to help your fish and that it might die even with vet care.

, Preventing disease in your goldfish is the best way to save it from dying. From cleaning the tank regularly to feeding your goldfish a varied diet, taking proper care of your goldfish can help minimize the risk of death., Keeping the water your goldfishes swim in clean is essential to keeping him alive. You need to not only make sure the water is the optimal temperature, but also that there is sufficient oxygen in the tank.Goldfish thrive in water temperatures between 50 and 78 degrees Fahrenheit.The cooler the water is, the higher its oxygen content.
Goldfish produce a lot of waste, which causes the level of ammonia to increase in the tank, which in turn increases the risk for disease or death.Test water every week to help ensure that the water quality is high., If you clean your tank regularly, it will not only maintain the water quality, but will also remove any bacteria or algae that could endanger your goldfish’s life.Weekly cleanings can go a long way to preventing disease in fish.Change out several gallons of water every week to remove excess chemicals.Clean gravel and the sides of the tank from any algae or slime that may have developed.Prune any plants that have overgrown.Clean or replace the charcoal filter once a month.Make sure to not use any chemical or soaps to clean the tank, as these can kill your fish.

, One of the best ways to prevent death in your goldfish is to feed him a balanced and varied diet. It’s equally important to not overfeed your goldfish, which can not only make the fish sick, but also affect the water quality.You can feed your fish commercial fish foods, which come in dry flake form. These provide a balanced diet.Give your goldfish variety with foods such as peas, brine shrimp, bloodworms, and tubifex worms.You can give your fish algae from the tank as a snack by allowing it to grow on one corner so the goldfish can nibble on it.Don’t overfeed your goldfish. They only need feeding once per day and any excess food will fall to the bottom of the tank and can spoil the water., If only one or some of your goldfish are sick or on the brink of death, separate infected goldfish from the healthy ones. This can help prevent healthy fish from developing diseases or dying.It’s a good idea to have a so-called “hospital tank” for sick fish.Only return fish to a tank once they’re healthy."

Examine your goldfish's behavior.,
Choose a visual or audible cue for your fish.,
Wait for your fish to move, use the cue and reward your fish.,
Practice until your goldfish gets good at their trick.",How to Make a Goldfish More Interesting1," Examine the simple things that your goldfish does and how they react to different types of stimuli. Take notice if they get excited when you get their food, where they like to swim, and what kind of behavior they naturally exhibit. This will not only make your fish more enjoyable, but it will also help you understand it when you start to train it.


Potential tricks include swimming in a circle, swimming under a rock, or swimming backward. Pay close attention to their natural behavior and what the fish is inclined to do.Your fish probably already has some trained behavior, like coming to the surface of the tank when you have fish food in your hands or following your finger on the tank.;
, The cue will tell it that it did an excellent job and should be followed by a reward in the form of fish food. Cues include a clicker, saying something, pointing, moving a feeding stick in the tank, or shining a flashlight on the tank.You will also need a cue to initiate the trick itself, which can be any of the above options, but must differ from the cue that indicates a reward is imminent.


For instance, you can drag your feeding stick in a circular motion in the water as the ""do it"" cue, then use a clicker and reward your fish for the ""did it"" cue.
Do not tap on the glass for your cue. The vibrations created can stress out your goldfish. , Before your can reward your fish for doing a trick, your fish needs to know that the ""did it"" cue equals a reward. At first, wait for your goldfish to make any movement, then use your cue and put some food in the tank. This will make it so your fish associates reward with your cue.


The cue must come immediately before the reward to reinforce the behavior. If you wait too long, your fish won't associate your cue with the reward.If your fish exhibits specific behaviors such as following your feeding stick or coming up to the surface of the tank when you walk by, these actions can act as natural ""do it"" cues.
After a couple of practice tries, don't use the cue or reward your fish until they do the trick that you want them to. This will teach them to associate the trick with a reward.

, Classical conditioning requires a lot of repetition. Your goldfish is reasonably smart, but it will take a lot of tries before they likely get it right, or associate your cue with a particular behavior. Don't lose your patience and realize that it's a gradual process.

Purchase another goldfish.,
Add rocks and other structures to your tank.,
Add plant life to your goldfish tank.",How to Make a Goldfish More Interesting2," Goldfish like to socialize with other fish and they are rarely aggressive to one another.Make sure to buy goldfish that compliment one another. For instance, do not put a shy or vision impaired species, like a telescope eye goldfish, with a more active species of goldfish like the shubunkin or comet. You can also prevent conflict amongst your fish by providing enough food so that they don't have to compete for it.Adding more fish may make your goldfish a more interesting pet.


Make sure that your tank is big enough to accommodate more than one goldfish.
Larger goldfish like the comet, shubunkin and wakin require up to 100 gallons of water and thrive better in small ponds.
For smaller goldfish, make sure that there is at least 20 gallons for the first goldfish and an additional 10 gallons for each additional fish., Adding things for your goldfish to swim through and around will make it more intelligent and give it more things to do during the day.Consider adding structures or rocks to your tank to increase the complexity of your goldfish's habitat.


Adding structures to the tank will also make looking at it much more engaging and exciting for you as a pet owner.
Substrate is the stuff on the bottom of your tank. You can buy different color pebbles or sand for this.Do not add ceramics, wood, plastics, sharp glass, and certain rocks or corals to your tank as they can leech harmful chemicals that could kill your goldfish. When purchasing decorations for your tank, make sure to go to a pet store and talk to the owner about any potential dangers., Adding plant life to your goldfish tank will give it more character and make it a much more attractive habitat. Purchase plant life from a local pet store. However, keep in mind that goldfish are notorious for eating plant life and will most likely use it for grazing.Popular varieties of plants for fish tanks include java moss, java fern, and dwarf baby tears.
Adding plants to your tank introduces foreign bacteria, and the water needs time to adjust before it's a safe habitat for your goldfish. This is called the cycling process and typically takes two to eight weeks.You can cycle your fish tank by adding natural bacteria in the form of plant life and other additives to the tank, then adding a small amount of ammonia each day. Test the water until it has zero ammonia and zero nitrites, which are chemicals that will harm your goldfish."
"
Give your goldfish a name.,
Create a backstory for your goldfish.,
Talk to your goldfish.,
Memorialize old goldfish.",How to Make a Goldfish More Interesting3," To personalize your goldfish, think of a name that suits it. Look at how it swims, what it does, and how it looks and think of a name that would fit its character. If you give it a unique name, you may even be able to say the name as a cue when you train it.


Some common goldfish names are Bubbles, Comet, and Spot., Even though you may not know the history of your goldfish, doesn't mean that he doesn't have one. Use your imagination and think of their backstory. Come up with a tale about how he was born, who their parents were, and how he ended up in your house. Think about the perilous journey and all the miles your goldfish must have swum.


You can write a short story or draw pictures showing your goldfish's journey.

, Interact with your goldfish by talking to it. It may not understand what you are trying to say, but treating it like a pet will make you appreciate it more. Goldfish are living beings and should be treated with respect just like any other animal.


If you have no one to talk to, you can get your troubles off your chest by talking to your goldfish.
Even though they may not understand you, your goldfish will appreciate your company.

, While goldfish can live to be over ten years old, many common household goldfish do not make it that far.Instead of flushing deceased goldfish down the toilet, create a memorial or give it a proper burial in your backyard. Get your family to come out and say a couple of words about the fish so that it will be remembered.


Bury passed-away goldfish with their favorite stone or decoration from the fish tank.

"
"
Feed them from your hand.,
Use food to encourage particular behaviors.,
Use a feeding stick.",How to Play With a Goldfish1," Goldfish will eat from their owners’ hands after getting used to their aquarium for a few weeks. This behavior enables you to teach them tricks, using food as a reward.Feed goldfish different kinds of foods.
Goldfish like freeze dried food, pellets, flakes, or fresh or frozen vegetables.Be careful not to overfeed your fish. This can result in a disorder known as swim bladder. The goldfish becomes bloated and floats at the top of the water. The solution is to withhold food for two days or feed it only cooked beans or peas.;
, You can train your goldfish to do specific things like go through hoops. In fact, just as you do with a puppy, you can train your goldfish to do these things by using a treat system. Show them what you want them to do, then give them a reward. A training kit may provide a hollow stick you can place food in to deliver the treat more quickly.Show them what you want them to do by leading them through a trick with food, either with the feeding stick or your fingers.
For example, if you have a hoop set up in the water, hold the food on the opposite side of the hoop from where the goldfish is located. Let them eat the food after they have swum through the hoop.
Repeat this training routine with any action you wish your goldfish to make.

, A feeding might make it easier to encourage a goldfish to do particular things. This is because such a stick allows the food to stay under water and doesn’t get in the goldfish’s way. To make your own feeding stick for training, try using food stuck to the end of a skewer.If you don’t have a feeding stick, place goldfish food on top of the water. If your goldfish will eat from your fingers, you can deliver the reward snack this way as well.

"
"
Find a training kit.,
Develop a daily training schedule.,
Add one trick at a time.,
Come up with your own games.",How to Play With a Goldfish2," It is possible to train a goldfish to do tricks. You have to work with them consistently like you do with dogs. One way to train a goldfish is to purchase a training kit. They usually come with toys, a manual, and a feeding stick to deliver rewards quickly.Watch the DVD and read the manual that comes with your training kit. This will help you learn how to train the goldfish.
Some kits come with a hoop, basketball court, tunnel, soccer goal, limbo bar, and so on., If you aren’t going to purchase a training video, you may be able to train a goldfish on your own. Start by building exercises into your daily routine with the goldfish. Select a few minutes that you are able to repeat everyday. Do training at the same time of day.Keep in mind that the goldfish needs to be at least two inches long. This is because fish of this length or longer respond better to training., Don’t expect your goldfish to be able to do all the tricks you have in mind right away. Start by training them in one trick at a time. After they become very good at one trick, add another one.Eventually you may be able to add more than one trick into one training session.

, If you don’t have a goldfish training kit, think of your own games. For example, place a rubber band in the bottom of the water so that it stands on its side like a hoop. Drag food through the hoop with your fingers to entice the goldfish to swim through it. Give it the food every time it swims through.


Also consider placing a small, thoroughly washed ball into the water and encouraging the goldfish to push it around.

"
"
Use large and smooth gravel stones.,
Plant artificial plants.,
Add wood.,
Be careful about novelties.,
Avoid holes and small caves.,
Give your goldfish lots of room.,
Add other goldfish.,
Learn what goldfish don’t like to do.,
Observe what goldfish like to do.",How to Play With a Goldfish3," Goldfish love to swim around the bottom of the tank. Because of this, you need to make sure your stones are large so that they cannot be swallowed. Also make sure the stones have no sharp edges so the goldfish don’t cut their mouths.Make sure that your rocks are treated so they don’t change the chemistry of your tank water.An easy way to do this is to purchase rocks at a pet store.
If you must gather rocks from your property, boil them before adding them to the tank. Also make sure they are large and smooth.

, Goldfish like to be near plants.However, they also like to eat them. When you are setting up your goldfish aquarium, use plastic plants from a pet store.Avoid cheap plant décor because the plastics can leach chemicals into your goldfish tank water., Wood will add interest and a natural appearance to a goldfish tank. Since wood needs to be treated so it doesn’t affect the water, do not use wood you find on your own. Purchase either treated wood or artificial wood purchased at a pet store.You can add branches and small, hollow logs to a goldfish tank.
Wood can give your fish something to swim around during the day.

, There are many novelty fish tank accessories available on the market. However, purchasing these cheap plastic toys can be hazardous for your tank water. Make sure you purchase plastic novelties from reputable aquarium retailers.Novelty examples include sunken pirate ships, colorful corals, a diver, etc.

, Having caves and holes through objects can be fun for a goldfish. However, you must make sure that the holes aren’t too small. If a round opening is too small, your goldfish can scrape its belly or sides, which is harmful to their skin.Instead, estimate how large your goldfish will get by talking to your pet store sales person. The length a goldfish gets depends on its variety.
Goldfish can be as small as six inches or as large as 16 inches long.Purchase caves and holes that have a larger diameter than your goldfish will be at full size.

, Goldfish grow fast and produce a lot of waste. Because of this, you should provide one gallon of tank space for every two inches of goldfish. It’s good to provide a ten-gallon tank for one goldfish, even though this may look sort of empty.Goldfish reach full size in two years. Consider this when purchasing your tank.
A large tank is good for doing tricks as well. It provides plenty of room for the fish to move around.
Goldfish can grow to anywhere between 6 and 16 inches, depending on the variety., Goldfish like to play with other fish.However, since goldfish are very sensitive to the water they live in, you cannot place them in the same environment with fish who need warmer or saltier water. For example, goldfish should not be placed in the same water with tropical fish.Tropical fish are bad partners for goldfish because they need warmer water and eat more protein than goldfish.
Keep in mind that with goldfish, you don’t need a fish to clean the tank by eating algae. Goldfish love to eat so they will eat algae themselves.

, There are many things that goldfish don’t do. Knowing can prevent you from hurting your goldfish or being disappointed when they don’t do what you think they should. For example, goldfish don’t like small fish bowls. They need space to perform well.Goldfish also don’t like being touched on their bodies, bright lights, or loud noises.
Do not tap on the tank to get your goldfish's attention. Goldfish hear through vibrations in the water, and tapping on the glass creates loud vibrations that will bother them., Goldfish enjoy exploring their environment. Giving them wide spaces, a varied diet, and other goldfish to swim with helps them enjoy their daily lives. Once they are used to you, you can use food to interact with them.Try holding food over one side of the tank, then moving it to the other before feeding them. This will encourage the goldfish to follow you.

Remove the eggs from the tank.,
Create good hatching conditions.,
Keep the tank at the right temperature.,
Make sure to have a filtration system.,
Aerate the tank.,
Place smooth gravel at the bottom of the tank.,
Feed the fry a healthy diet.,
Replace the water regularly.,
Keep the water at a steady temperature.,
Expect to lose some goldfish fry.,
Remove the parents from the tank.,
Get fluke medication.,
Add anti-fungal liquid to the water.",How to Raise Goldfish Fry," You want to remove the eggs as soon as they are laid. If you are intentionally breeding goldfish, you may have spongy material known as ""spawning mops."" Goldfish may also lay their eggs in fixtures in the tank, such as underwater castles. Wherever your goldfish have spawned on, remove this material from the tank.Gently flush the material in clean water. You want to make sure any debris from the tank is removed.
Once the material is removed and flushed, you can transfer it to a new environment.;
, Once the eggs hatch, you want to make sure the conditions in your tank and safe and hospitable. Transfer your eggs to a clean environment.When you place the fry eggs in the aquarium, do not fill the tank too deep. Ideally, a fry aquarium should only have water 6 to 7 inches deep.
The eggs should hatch 4 to 5 days after being laid.

, Goldfish fry require warmer temperatures than average fish to thrive. You'll need to keep the tank between 70–75 °F (21.1–23.9 °C). You may need to install a heater, which you can purchase at a local pet store, in the tank. Keep a thermometer in the tank so you can make sure the water is always around the proper temperature., Fish tanks get dirty very easily without proper filtration, which can be particularly dangerous for young fish. Stop by your local pet store and pick up a power filter, which is a filtration system that hangs on the back of a goldfish tank.Filtration systems are generally simple to install as long as you follow instructions carefully. They can usually be fitted onto the bank of most fish aquariums.
There is really no such thing as too much filtration when it comes to goldfish, as they're particularly messy. It may be a good idea to install two filters. In the event one filter gives out, a second filter can pick up the slack. Exposure to germs, even for a brief period, can be dangerous for young goldfish fry.

, An aeration system must be put in place to make sure your fish get enough oxygen. Air stones or bubble wands, which you can purchase at most pet stores, work well for aeration in a goldfish tank.As with a filtration system, it's a good idea to have two bubble wands in place as they can clog easily.
Air stones break down with time when submerged in water, so make sure to replace air stones frequently. Replace air stones when they begin to look cracked and broken down.

, You should choose large, smooth bits of gravel to fill the bottom of the pond. Gravel too small could be swallowed by a goldfish. It's a good idea to look through a bag of gravel to check for jagged bits of gravel as well. Discard any pointy stones, as goldfish could scrape their stomachs., When growing, fry should be fed several times a day. Make sure you choose a high quality fish flake that is small enough for fry consumption.Powder-based foods are generally safe for goldfish fry. This is mostly a mix of algae and processed foods and contains the right minerals and vitamins for goldfish fry.
You should also provide pellets for adult fish as a supplement to their diet. You may have to break dry pellets apart before feeding them to fish fry, however, as they may be too big for the fry to eat.

, About 25% of the tank's water should be replaced on a weekly basis. Fish fry are dirty, so their water becomes contaminated quickly. Make sure to add water of the same temperature to the tank.It can be difficult to see goldfish fry in a larger aquarium when they are very young. Therefore, be careful when you remove the water from the tank. Use a transparent container to scoop out the water. Check for any goldfish fry before disposing.If you see a goldfish fry in the water you scooped out, use a smaller container, like a small piece of Tupperware, to scoop out the goldfish fry and transfer it back into the tank.

, Rapid changes in water temperature can be dangerous for goldfish fry. Remember, the water should be between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. There should not be temperature fluctuations more than a few degrees a day. If the tank's temperature fails to stay the same, you may have to install a heating system., Even with proper care, not all goldfish fry will survive into adulthood. Unfortunately, on average only about 30% of the fry make it to adulthood. About 5% of fry are born with a deformity that kills them off quickly, and 60% will die of disease. Do not feel discouraged or at fault if only a few of your fry survive. This is a normal part of the process., Goldfish will eat their eggs, or eat the fry after they hatch. As soon as you notice eggs, remove the parents from the tank and transfer them somewhere else until the goldfish are grown. You can also remove the eggs from the tank and transfer., Fluke, a type of disease, can cause an unusual number of fry to die. It's a good idea to have fluke medication on hand. If you notice the fry are dying quickly, dispense the medication.You can buy fluke medication at a local pet store. There should be instructions on the box on how to administer the medication.
The sooner you intervene, the better. You can save a good portion of your fry with quick intervention in the event of a fluke outbreak.

, Not all goldfish fry eggs are fertile. Infertile eggs will grow fungus, which can affect the development of fertile eggs. You can purchase an anti-fungal liquid at your local pet store. You should administer the recommended amount to the tank within a few days of the eggs hatching. Usually, you add enough that the water turns a blueish color."

Ask how large the pleco will grow to be.,
Check to see if a pleco is compatible with your goldfish.,
Be ready for a commitment.,
Make sure your tank is big enough for a pleco.,
Add some driftwood to the tank.,
Provide cover for your pleco.,
Measure the pH and temperature levels of the tank.,
Check to see if your filter is set up correctly.,
Add the bag containing your pleco to the tank.,
Pour some tank water into the pleco's bag.,
Scoop the pleco out of the bag and place it in the tank.,
Keep an eye on your fish.,
Feed your pleco.",How to Introduce a Pleco to a Goldfish Tank," Although most pet stores will sell plecos that are only a few inches in length, you should know that they can grow quite large. Fully grown plecos can reach up to two feet in length. The exact size of the pleco will vary depending on the species. Ask someone at the pet store how large the pleco will get before making a purchase., There are a few varieties of pleco fish and each will have their own temperament. Some plecos may become rather aggressive when they grow to a larger size or encounter other fish. Because of this, you will want to make sure that the species you are buying will be safe to place in the same tank as your goldfish. Ask someone at your pet store if the pleco you are interested in would be a good mix with your goldfish.Rubber-lipped plecos are generally non-aggressive towards goldfish and prefer a similar tank environment.
Longfin bristlenose plecos will usually have no conflicts with your goldfish. However, these plecos tend to fight with other plecos.
Zebra plecos tend to be more carnivorous and may eat other fish in your tank.

, Plecos can live for a long time and grow quite large. Because they can live so long, you'll need to be committed to caring for the pleco over the course of its life. If you don't think you will maintain your goldfish tank for around ten years, you may want to reconsider purchasing a pleco., Plecos will start off quite small and can seem like the perfect addition to any goldfish tank. However, it's important to realize that your pleco can grow up to 2 feet in length. You'll need to have a tank large enough to accommodate the full grown pleco or have plans to provide a larger tank later on.The tank should be around 75 gallons to comfortably accommodate a fully grown pleco.
Plecos may become dangerous to other fish if the tank is overcrowded.
Don't try to house multiple plecos in one tank as they will likely fight and kill one another.

, Plecos will get most of their diet from the algae on the fish tank walls. However, plecos have a need to gnaw on driftwood to provide extra nutrition. Make sure your tank has some driftwood placed in it to provide a proper and healthy environment for your pleco., Plecos will love to have plenty of hiding places in the aquarium. These spaces can help make your pleco feel more relaxed, give them a place to rest and prevent aggressive behavior. Make sure your tank has a few areas where your pleco can take a break and get some rest.Adding in some pipes or tunnels can be a good idea.
You can find many different styles and types of cover for your pleco at most pet stores.
Make sure you securely position any plants in your aquarium. Pleco fish will easily uproot and destroy any plants that aren't securely rooted.

, Like most fish, plecos will have a specific range of temperature and pH levels that they can comfortably live in. You'll want to take careful measurements of both the tank's temperature and pH levels before adding in your pleco. Levels that are too high or too low may cause your pleco to become unhealthy or even die.Plecos will do well in tanks that range from 68-84 degrees Fahrenheit.
pH levels can range between 6.5 and 8.

, In their natural environment, plecos enjoy fast moving water and strong currents. While you won't be able to emulate the full strength of the pleco's preferred current, you will want to have a high powered filter. Providing a constant water current in the tank will help your pleco feel comfortable and at home., The first step in introducing your pleco to the tank will be to simply place the entire bag into the tank. Adding the bag that contains your pleco to the tank will gently match the temperature of the water in the bag to that of the tank's water. This will help your pleco avoid any shock that can come from large temperature differences in the water.Keep the bag closed when placing it on the water's surface.
Let the bag sit for at least ten minutes.
Make sure none of the water in the tank or the bag are able to mix.

, Once your pleco has been floating on the surface of the tank water for a while, you can start adding tank water to the pleco's bag. Adding water will help to gently introduce the pleco to the temperature and pH levels of the tank's water. Adding the tank water to the pleco's bag is an important step and will help avoid potential health risks to your pleco.Wait ten minutes between adding more water to the bag.
Keep the bag sealed to avoid the uncontrolled mixing of tank and bag water.
Do not let the bag's water spill into the tank.
Eventually, the entire bag will be filled with tank water.

, After the bag has been filled with tank water and the pleco has had time to acclimate, you can scoop it out with a net and put it in the tank. Open up the bag and put your net in to catch the pleco. Put the net and the pleco into the tank and allow it to swim out of the net.Don't dump the pleco out into the tank.
Do not mix the bag water into the tank water.

, Now that your pleco is at home in the tank, you'll want to keep an eye on all of your fish. Your pleco will likely adjust with no trouble. However, your pleco may attack or try to feed off of your goldfish. You will need to keep an eye on the behavior of all your fish to make sure they are getting along well.Goldfish have a film around them that plecos may try to eat.
Look for red marks on your goldfish. These marks can indicate your pleco is feeding from the goldfish.
If your pleco is causing difficulties in the tank, you can try adding more hiding spots to lower aggression and make it feel more comfortable., Although plecos will be happy to eat any algae or plants they find in your aquarium, they will still require you to give them food. Adding in these additional food items will help ensure that your pleco is getting the nutrients that it needs. Try offering some of these food items to help keep your pleco happy and healthy:Large plecos can eat tiny bits of shrimp or fish.
Vegetables such as salad, cucumbers or squash can be given to your pleco.
Spirulina tablets can be given to your pleco.

Test your goldfish’s water weekly.,
Keep ammonia levels at 0ppm.,
Maintain nitrite levels at 0ppm and nitrate levels below 40ppm.,
Ensure a pH-balanced tank.",How to Keep a Goldfish Alive1," Get a fish tank water-testing kit from the pet store, which should include testing equipment for reading ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH levels.Several natural processes that occur in your tank can be kept in check by setting up your tank properly, but certain parameters still need to be tested for every week.;
, Ammonia is a natural byproduct of the food your goldfish doesn’t eat, as well as the goldfish’s waste. Bacteria will eat the ammonia in your tank, but if the bacteria die or something else goes wrong, high ammonia levels can become extremely dangerous.If you’re getting positive ammonia readings, change the tank’s water immediately.
Determine whether overfeeding, an insufficient filtering system, or overcrowding and remedy the issue as soon as possible.

, Nitrites are usually converted by your water filter into nitrates, but can make your goldfish unhealthy if not kept in check. During cycling, nitrite levels may reach 0.75ppm, but should never exceed this amount. Keep nitrate levels between 5 and 20ppm.Change the tanks water if nitrites are present. Their presence indicates ammonia levels are likely also too high, or your filtration system needs to be adjusted.
Nitrate, which is safe at low levels, can also be harmful at higher levels and can lead to unwanted algae in the tank.
A partial water change should be sufficient to reduce nitrate levels.

, Water that is too acidic will allow ammonia levels to increase very quickly. Water that is too alkaline (or basic) actually makes natural levels of ammonia more harmful.Shoot for the ideal levels of pH for goldfish, which are between 7.2 and 7.6 pH.
If you need to adjust pH, do so minimally by adding pH decreaser or alkaline buffers that are designed for this purpose, and are available online or in pet stores.
Use water generated by reverse osmosis if you are unable to change the pH of the water you're using. You may be unable to adjust the pH of certain municipal water supplies because of specific mineral content in the water.

Feed your goldfish a well-monitored, nutritious diet.,
Take care not to overfeed your goldfish.,
Watch out for signs of illness or infection.,
Diagnose your goldfish’s illness by consulting specific symptom lists online.",How to Keep a Goldfish Alive2," Feed your goldfish 2 or 3 times a day. Feed them only a few pinches of food each session. Be sure you’re feeding your goldfish nutritional feed that is designed for the particular type of goldfish you have.In total, provide an amount of food over the course of the day that allows for 5 to 6 minutes of feeding.
If the food is dry, soak it in water from the tank for five to ten seconds before feeding your fish. Un-soaked food can injure or sicken the fish when it expands in the stomach.
Favor pellets, which should sink, but also include flaked fish food – which will often float on the surface, as goldfish like to eat from both the surface and the bottom of the tank.

, While feeding goldfish, follow the classic ""less is more"" approach, as overfeeding a goldfish leads to far more dangerous complications than underfeeding. Watch for long trails of poop trailing from behind your goldfish. If present, you're feeding it too much., Your goldfish should usually be fully aware of its surroundings and be moving around with interest and excitement. Most of a goldfish’s time is spent nibbling on stuff and actively swimming around. If your goldfish isn’t doing so, look closely for signs that it may be sick.Goldfish eyes should be entirely clear. If your goldfish has foggy eyes, it is likely sick.
Check out the fish’s fins and body. Fins should be stiff and solid, without uneven edges.
Look at the goldfish’s skin. White spots, fuzzy patches, or red streaks all indicate illness.
Test your water at the first signs of illness. Often, an illness is a sign that either water or feeding needs to be adjusted.

, Whether your goldfish has developed unsightly spots, is floating around erratically, or has fins that are not as sprightly as usual, there are proven methods of treatment for the most common goldfish illnesses.There a handful of common goldfish diseases, most of which can be treated by refreshing the water, though some require more detailed treatment.
Identify the particular sickness your goldfish is suffering from by crosschecking its symptoms with online descriptions and treat your fish accordingly.

Only put certain natural plants in your goldfish tank.",How to Keep a Goldfish Alive3," Though many goldfish are doomed to life inside a glass sphere, fishbowls are generally not spacious enough for a goldfish to be happy and healthy. A 20 gallon (75.7 L) is ideal for your first goldfish, as it can hold 2-3 fancy goldfish if you decide to increases your fish forces.


The type of goldfish you have will help determine the size of tank they’ll need. Fancy goldfish can be kept in a 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank, but bigger goldfish like comets need a tank of around 50 gallons (189.3 L).
For each additional goldfish you add to your aquatic family, increase the capacity of your fish tank by roughly 10 gallon (37.9 L) for each additional fish.

, Gravel is necessary to help maintain the water quality of your tank and to keep your goldfish happy. Goldfish are scavengers. They will pick up pieces of gravel and toss them back and forth, or just gum them for a while with their fish lips.Accordingly, choose gravel that is made up of individual pieces that are too large for the fish to swallow.

, Further, goldfish are curious, and benefit from incredibly short memories. Provide your goldfish up with ample rocks, caves, or artificial plants. A well-decorated tank can provide them with a lifetime of adventure. Your selection of décor, including natural or artificial rocks and plants must follow the following guidelines:Don’t use wood. Though that piece of driftwood from your beach walk does look spectacular, it will likely discolor your fish tank’s water and may even turn to mush.
Beware of materials that may affect the pH of the water. If you’re adding stuff you find outside, even just rocks and sea-shells, check your pH frequently.
Don’t place anything sharp in your fish tank. If your goldfish becomes frightened and move quickly, they may injure themselves.

, Goldfish are notoriously aggressive with plants. While gravel can defend itself, plants will easily get torn up by the voracious behavior of your goldfish friends. Some plants are more resilient, and tend to get along better with goldfish generally.Gravel and natural plants in particular provide more than an inviting ambiance – they also help keep the biological environment inside the tank stable, so include at least a few natural plants in your tank.
Try Vallisneria types, different Hygrophilas, Red Bacopa or even Ludwigia Arcuata.

Use a filtration system.,
Add safe, clean, and balanced water.,
Place the goldfish’s tank somewhere safe and sensible.,
Make sure the water temperature stays between 60 °F (16 °C) and 72 °F (22 °C).You probably don’t need a heater to maintain a temperature in this range, as it almost identical to the range commonly maintained in human dwellings.",How to Keep a Goldfish Alive4," A filter is a vital piece of equipment to help keep your goldfish alive. The filter you’ll need depends on the size of your tank, as filters operate according to a flow rate which will correspond with the amount of water your tank holds. Ensure you get a filter with the correct flow rate, and choose between an external or internal filter.If you can’t match your tank’s capacity to a the exact flow rated filter, go overboard. For instance, if you have a 20 gallon (75.7 L) tank, shoot for a filter rated for 40 gallons (151.4 L).
External filters sit on an outside wall of the tank or within the tank’s lid. Internal filters are submerged within the tank. Either type of filter can work for a goldfish tank.
Lean towards opting for an external filter, as they have a greater capacity to store filtration materials, can clean water more thoroughly, and will require less maintenance.

, Your goldfish requires properly conditioned water to neutralize commonly occurring chlorine and chloramine. Feel free to use tap water, for instance, but add conditioner from a pet supplies store to make it safe for your goldfish to live in.Make sure the water has the right pH level too. For goldfish, ideal pH levels are a slightly alkaline 7.2-7.6 pH.
Use a pH test kit to test your goldfish’s water regularly, and adjust the pH if necessary with additives available at the pet store.

, Do not place the tank near a window or any heating or cooling source. Do not allow sunlight to hit the tank directly. Also be sure the tank is set on something flat and extremely sturdy.Though you will likely need to set your fish tank near an outlet, don’t allow electrical cords dangle over your fish tank. An electrical shock could absolutely fry your goldfish, and be dangerous for you as well.
Similarly, be sure that no cord is pulling against the side of the tank or the base that the tank is resting upon. Place the tank in a location it will not be jostled.

, If you live in a particularly hot or cold climate, ensure that seasonal or daily changes in temperature do not put your goldfish at risk.

Grow healthy bacteria in your tank by adding ammonia.,
Cycle the fish tank’s water once a month.,
Speed up the cycling process with a few tricks.,
Change some of the tank’s water once a week.",How to Keep a Goldfish Alive5," Before moving your goldfish into its tank, let the water sit for at least a few weeks. This time is necessary for the tank to provide a healthy biological environment for your goldfish, so be patient!More specifically, allow the tank to build colonies of bacteria, which will develop on the filter and in the gravel. You’ll maintain this biological environment via a process called cycling.


Once your tank is setup and the filter is installed and turned on, add ammonia.
Continue adding ammonia – while trying to keep it’s amount at 0.06ppm – until enough bacteria have developed to eat both the ammonia and nitrites in your tank.
Determine your levels of ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates by using test kits designed for this purpose.
Continue the process until you get readings that indicate zero ammonia and zero nitrite.

, Regularly cycle the fish tank by changing 100% of the tank’s water while taking care to keep the bacteria that are present in the tank alive. This will help your water “cycle” nitrogen, which is necessary to keep your fish alive.After the emptying the tank of water, add fresh, conditioned water.
Repeat the process of adding ammonia and testing for ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates.
Once you have reading of zero ammonia and zero nitrite, as well as a bit of nitrate in the water - which is produced by the bacteria - your tank has been successfully cycled.

, Keep the water slightly warmer during cycling to increase the speed of bacteria growth. You can even borrow bacteria from a friend who already has a well-established, recently cycled fish tank. Seed your own tank by taking some of their gravel or cutting off a piece of their filter’s sponge and adding it to your tank.Alternatively, add a bottle of ready-to-go bacteria from the fish store. If you go this route, still expect to add some ammonia and test until the tank is balanced.

, You need to change the water even more often than you cycle it. To curb the buildup of waste, change 25-50% of the tank’s water once a week.Leave some of the water in the tank, however, to maintain a healthy amount of bacteria developed by less frequent cycling.


When changing some of the tank’s water, rinse the filter and any tank décor with water your remove from the tank.
Never use tap water to rinse anything that goes in your tank.
Only add clean water that you’ve treated with conditioner.

Check the fish you are preparing to buy, or if it is already in your tank, observe it.",How to Identify and Care for Lionhead Goldfish1," Lionhead Goldfish have the following as physical traits:


Lionhead Goldfish completely lack a stabilizing dorsal fin. If your fish has a dorsal fin, it is most certainly not a Lionhead.
Lionhead Goldfish are round and ""fat"" relative to other Goldfish.
Lionhead Goldfish grow a fleshy ""growth"" on the top of their head. It is normally orange, and they have been bred to show off the Chinese Lion-Dog. This is why they are called Lionheads in the first place. If the fish does not have this fleshy growth, it is not a Lionhead.
Lionheads come in a variety of colours, such as red, white, silver, and black.;
"
"
Avoid a hard tank.,
Keep the tank clean.,
Choose the right tankmates.",How to Identify and Care for Lionhead Goldfish2," Since Lionheads are so delicate, their tank should not be extremely hard. They can hurt themselves swimming into it.

, Pollution does not sit well with the Lionhead, and other ""fancy goldfish"" and can easily kill them off, as they were not bred to survive in such harsh environments.


All fish, especially fragile fish such as the Lionhead, should still receive, at the very least, biological filtration in order to reduce pollution, as stated before, Lionheads do not do well in polluted areas.

, Lionheads are relatively slow, and should not be put into a tank with faster or more aggressive fish, as, during feeding time, the Lionhead will have a very tough time keeping up, and the more aggressive fish really doesn't care. The Lionhead will have a hard time keeping up, and if the aggressive fish does happen to get aggressive, the Lionhead has no real defense against it. Keep it in a solitary tank, in a same-species tank, or around other more passive fish.


Lionheads are passive and do not normally encroach upon the space of other fish. Bottom feeders such as catfish are not necessary when goldfish are around, as goldfish bottom feed by nature. However, due to its pattern and lack of a dorsal fin, Lionheads, if not kept alone, should be kept around other ""chill"" or ""relaxed"" fish, as aggressive, hyper, and jumpy fish may accidentally injure the Lionhead.
Lionheads are not venomous, and pose no biological threat to any fish inside of your tank or to the tank's biosphere in any way. Socialize it if you wish, but do not place it around any aggressive fish, as conflicts may arise, or any living plants, if you wish for them to stay living.

"
"
Keep in mind that Lionheads are omnivores.",How to Identify and Care for Lionhead Goldfish3," What this means is that they will eat both meats, and plants. They are not picky eaters, and will eat flake foods, live meat, or frozen meat, however, if you are to feed them meat, it is best for the food to be deceased, as again, Lionheads are pretty slow. Lionheads should be fed around two to three times a day. Lionheads love:

Learn about your goldfish's digestive system.,
Learn about the purpose of your goldfish's swim bladder.",How to Feed Goldfish," Goldfish are omnivores, which means that they eat meats and plants.There are many types of food that you can feed your goldfish,and it can be overwhelming to go into the pet store and see all of the available options. Before purchasing any food, take some time to learn what the different options are.


Keep in mind that each type of food has its advantages and disadvantages.
Your goldfish’s diet should consist of many different types of food. Purchasing different types of food will help you keep his diet interesting and ensure that your goldfish receives all of the nutrients that he needs to stay healthy.;
, Dry food is one of the most common types of goldfish food. Dry food is usually sold in cans and comes in either flakes or pellets. Flakes will stay at the top of the tank and pellets will typically sink to the bottom. Your goldfish will feed at the top and bottom of his tank, so you can use either type of dry food.In general, dry food is fairly healthy for your goldfish, but does not have all of the nutrients that he needs. Because of this, dry food should not be the main component of your goldfish’s diet.
Since flakes stay at the surface, the excess flakes can be removed easily, making the tank easier to keep clean.

, Live food is an excellent source of protein for your goldfish, and is considered to be the most important part of his diet. Examples of live food are earthworms, bloodworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp.If not prepared properly, live food has the potential to transmit disease to your goldfish. To reduce the likelihood of disease transmission, purchase the live food from your local pet store, rather than searching in lakes, ponds, or the dirt.Usually, brine shrimp and earthworms are highly unlikely to transmit disease.Earthworms are more available during the summer months, during their breeding season.
Brine shrimp are very tiny shrimp. They are extremely high in protein, so they should be used as treats rather than a regular part of your goldfish's diet., Frozen and freeze-dried foods often provide the same level of nutrients as live food.Frozen or freeze-dried foods are also good if you’re a bit squeamish about handling live worms. The live food will most likely be available in frozen or freeze-dried form at your local pet store.


Another advantage of frozen foods is that they are easy to store.If you have frozen crab, lobster, or mussels at home, you can also feed these to your goldfish. Make sure that they are cleaned and thawed before you put them in your goldfish’s tank., Fruit and vegetables are important components of your goldfish’s diet. They are a great source of nutrients and are low in fat. There are many types of fruits and vegetables that you can feed your goldfish, including peas, lettuce, broccoli, and apples.Whichever fruit or vegetable you choose, it will need to be softened, cut or diced, and peeled before you feed it to your goldfish. It will also be important not to season the fruits or vegetables in any way., A good rule of thumb is to feed your goldfish no more than he can eat in about one to two minutes. Goldfish can literally eat themselves to death, so you need to be very careful that you do not need overfeed your goldfish. Feeding him up to three times a day should be sufficient.


Grab just enough food that you can easily pinch between your thumb and index finger. This is about the amount of food that you should feed your goldfish.

, With the many different types of goldfish food that are available, you will need to know the proper way to prepare each type of food. This will lessen the likelihood that your goldfish will experience digestive upset after eating.


Pre-soak flakes to prevent your goldfish from swallowing air bubbles when he eats the flakes; swallowing air bubbles can lead to swim bladder problems and constipation. To pre-soak the flakes, dip them in the tank water a few times before fully placing them in the water. Feed them one to two times a week.
Pre-soak pellets for 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are about twice their original size. Place a small amount of tank water in another container and place the pellets in this container. After they have softened up and increased in size, add them to the tank. Feed the pellets two to three times a week.
Pre-soak freeze-dried food in a small container of tank water to prevent digestive upset.Completely thaw frozen foods before adding them to your goldfish’s tank. Place the food in your refrigerator for the thawing process.
Peel, chop, and soften fruits and vegetables. Boiling is a good way to soften vegetables. Fruits and vegetables can be given as occasional treats.
Thoroughly rinse live food if you find it yourself in the environment. Rinsing earthworms with water will help to remove the dirt and potential disease-causing organisms that may be in the dirt.
To feed worms, cut them into small pieces before putting them in your goldfish's tank; you could even try placing the small pieces on a toothpick and feeding them to your fish that way. Feed the live food once a week.

, Pay close attention to your goldfish when you feed him to make sure that he does not overeat. If he has eaten too much, his intestinal tract may become full of food, which would trap gas in his swim bladder and cause him to float aimlessly.If you see him floating like this, immediately remove any remaining food.


Contact your veterinarian or local pet store for advice on how to treat a goldfish who has overeaten.

, If you will be away from your house for more than a few days, make a plan as to how you want to have your goldfish fed. One option is to have someone feed your goldfish for you. If you choose this option, it would be a good idea to make a detailed list of your goldfish's diet with instructions on how to feed him while you are away.Preparing the foods ahead of time and placing them in individual containers may make it easier for whomever will feed your goldfish.
Automatic fish feeders are also available. Visit your local pet store to learn more about these feeders.Keep in mind that goldfish can actually go a long time without eating. Although they will be hungry, goldfish can go up to three weeks without eating., Goldfish do not have teeth in their jaws.Their teeth are located in the back of their throat, which allows them to crush food and swallow food whole.If you listen closely enough, you may actually be able to hear a crunching noise from your goldfish’s teeth as he chews on his food.

, Goldfish do not have stomachs. Instead, your goldfish's intestines do the digestive work that a stomach would normally do. In addition, the lack of a stomach means that your goldfish cannot eat much food at a time; the food that he can eat will move quickly through his digestive system.The lack of a stomach makes your goldfish more susceptible to digestive problems if he is not fed properly., Your goldfish’s swim bladder is an internal gas-filled organ that allows him to stay buoyant in the water. If not fed the proper diet, your goldfish can develop problems with his swim bladder,which means that he would not be able to easily stay afloat in the water.

Let the koi see you.",How to Feed Koi," When deciding what to feed your koi, think of it in two parts—base diet and supplementary diet. The base diet should provide all the essential proteins, fats, and most of the vitamins and minerals your koi need to survive. Commercial pellet food is the most reliable, convenient, and healthy option for a base diet.


The protein content in food pellets should be at least 30 percent. Protein content in pellets varies greatly depending on manufacturer—usually between 25 and 36 percent—so read labels before deciding.The primary source of protein should be fish meal or soybean meal.
The fat content (from fish oil) in the pellets should be at least 5 percent.;
, Food pellets come in a variety of sizes and you might think the bigger the pellet, the more nutrients it contains. This, however, is not the case. Small pellets provide the same nutritional content as large ones and are easier for koi to ingest and digest, reducing the danger of intestinal impaction., Before feeding your koi, soak their food pellets in pond water for at least 30 seconds to one minute. This will make them safer and easier to digest.


This step is especially important when the feeding frequency is low or fish are especially hungry, otherwise, they may consume the pellets too quickly and end up eating dry pellets. Dry food can expand in the digestive track, increasing the risk for life-threatening internal blockages., Variety is important in a well-rounded diet. While the supplemental diet provides many of the same nutrients found in the base diet, it also provides a variety of other nutrients essential to your koi’s health. To increase variety, feed your koi natural pond plants and food scraps.


Natural pond plants include ordinary pond algae, as well as other plants like duckweed.
Vegetable scraps like peas, carrots, spinach, leaf lettuce, and so on, are also a good choice for supplementation., Frozen shrimp can be used as a protein supplement. However, they should be used sparingly.


Some people also provide scraps from fish they have prepared for their own meals as an occasional dietary supplement., Of course, koi are best-known for their beautiful colors. You can help preserve and enhance their color by feeding them color-enhancing foods every four weeks.


Look for foods that contain spirulina, shrimp, or krill.In the wild, koi eat crayfish, which are high in carotenoids, an important nutrient for enhancing the color red., Koi may enjoy eating live foods from time to time, like they do in the wild, as a special treat. This can also be a good way to supplement their base diet.


Feed koi crustaceans, insect larvae, worms, and aquatic plants.
Also include live plants to give koi some roughage and added vitamins and minerals., In order to determine the correct amount to feed your koi, you need to know the age, length, and weight of each fish in your pond, in addition to the water temperature. Find out how old your koi are when you purchase them and keep track of their age over the years. Keep a notebook or file with a description of each fish next to their stats., As with age, keep detailed notes on the length of each fish in your pond. To do this, measure from the tip of their nose to the tip of their tail. Measurements should be taken in inches.Domestic koi generally grow to 12 to 15 inches (30.5 to 38.1 cm) long.Most koi reach 50 percent of their final adult length in 24 months, 95 percent at 10 years, and 99 percent at 14 years.Update your notes at least twice a year to ensure your calculations are accurate.

, Determining your koi’s weight is the next step in figuring out how much to feed your fish. Use the formula (weight) = (length x length x length) / (144). In this formula, weight is in ounces and length is in inches.


The most accurate way is to actually weigh your fish, although this isn’t always practical.
Charts can also help you determine its weight. Most give an estimate using the fish’s length and build. For example, typically, a 12-inch long koi weighs around 12 ounces., The amount of food and frequency with which you feed your koi also depends on water temperature. A change in temperature impacts your koi’s eating habits. Higher temperatures quicken the koi’s metabolism, while lower temperatures slow it down.When water is between 60 to 85 °F (15.6 to 29.4 °C), feed your koi two to four times per day. When the temperature lowers to 50 to 60 °F (10 to 16 °C), feed them once a day or every other day.
Monitor the temperature year round. If the temperature rises above 90 or below 50 °F (10 °C), it is best to stop feeding your koi as their metabolism will slow and they will not be able to properly digest their food.

Koi will still have access to food in those cases where the water temperature is too high or too low. They will be able to eat the algae on the pond liner or rocks., In order to determine how much food to feed your fish, you will also need to know what percentage of their body weight each fish must eat in food each day. Percentage of body weight as food per day is dependent upon the age of the fish, as well as the water temperature. Ask your local koi expert for a chart that lays out the percentage needed for each in relation to the other.


For example, a one-year-old fish living in 72 degree Fahrenheit water needs to eat two percent of its body weight in food each day. A four-year-old koi needs one percent. Take this percentage times the weight of the fish to determine how many grams of food it needs each day., Once you have all your measurements and calculations, you’re ready to figure out the total amount you should feed your fish each day. To do so, use this formula: (length of fish) x (percentage of body weight as food per day) = amount to feed


For example, say you have a one-year-old fish that is five inches long and weighs 22 grams, living in 72 degree Fahrenheit water. According to your chart, it needs to eat two percent of its body weight per day. Your calculations would look like this: (5 in.) x (0.02 x 22 grams) = 0.44 grams per day

, You’ll most likely have more than one fish in your pond, so you need to figure out the total amount of food you’ll need to feed all your fish each day. To get this number, add together the total grams needed for each fish.


For example, say you have a one-year-old koi and a four-year-old koi in your pond. The one-year-old koi is five inches long and weighs 22 grams. The four-year-old koi is ten inches long and weighs 200 grams. The water temperature is 72 °F (22.2 °C). Based on age, weight, and water temperature, your one-year-old should receive two percent of their body weight as food per day and the four-year-old should receive one percent.

Using the calculations from the previous step, the one-year-old needs 0.44 grams of food per day. The four-year-old needs 2 grams per day . Add 0.44 and 2 together to get the total grams you need for both of your fish each day (2.44 grams)., Calculating the amount of food to feed your koi is the most accurate way to determine how much food to provide, but you should also pay attention each time you feed your koi. Feed your koi small amounts at least twice a day.


You want your koi to be able to eat all of the food you give them in a short amount of time (less than five minutes).Overfeeding koi can cause serious health problems like severe negative impacts on the liver and other internal functions.Pre-portion your fish food to keep from overfeeding., Ideally, it should be located near the edge of the water where you can keep an eye on how much they are eating and can check them for disease., In order to create a bond with your koi, they need to see you feeding them. Staying at the water’s edge while your koi eat lets them know you are the food provider and that you won’t hurt them.


This will help you increase the bond between you and your fish.
Once you have established a strong bond, you can work on hand-feeding your koi.

",How to Clean a Goldfish Tank,"


How much and how often depends on the weekly test results and isn't covered in this article. This article is to give new keepers a guide on how to perform a water change in the most effective, least stressful manner. Less stressful for both the fish and the keeper that is.;
, First of all you'll need water containers of enough capacity to hold all the water you are taking out of your tank and all the water you will be replacing it with. You'll need some dechlorinator that removes chlorine, chloramines and dangerous heavy metals from the tap water. Finally, you'll need a Gravel Vacuum.


All of this equipment should be available from your local fish store. For water containers though you may find that a DIY or camping store is cheaper. Make sure the container is 'food grade' though.

, To do this fill your 'clean' container with water from the cold tap and bring it up to the same temperature as the tank by either using boiled water or by adding a spare tank heater. Those with combi boilers can use hot water straight from the tap.

, If you plan to add medications, plant food, salts or other additives to the tank this should be added to the new water now.

, You're going to be walking around with heavy containers full of water. 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of water weighs 1kg so make sure they're not too heavy for you if necessary use multiple smaller containers. Also lay some towels down around the tank as its guaranteed there will be some drips and splashes. Leave the fresh water out the way for now but make sure all the empty containers that you will need are to hand.

, Put some slippers or shoes on to protect your feet and keep them dry.

, Wipe the inside panes of the tank to remove algae. A green kitchen scrubber (new and kept back for fish only) works, as do magnetic cleaners. Go easy, you don't want to scratch the glass.

, At the same time this collects all the solid waste that collects at the bottom. Siphon the water into the spare buckets or containers that you prepared earlier. For gravel just dig the end of the gravel vac in about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) and watch the dirt get sucked up then move the vac over a little and repeat. For sand it's a little trickier, wave the nozzle over the sand creating a small underwater dust devil. The dense sand will generally separate from the relatively light solid wastes.

,, You might have to decant the water into smaller containers so that it's easier to lift up to the tank and pour.

Sexing Young Bettas.",How to Breed Betta Fish," When attempting to breed any animal, it is important to know as much as you can about the species. Research betta care and breeding. There are many great websites and books. More than 600 eggs can come from a single spawn, meaning that you could end up caring for more than 500 betta fish! You need to know beforehand what you want to get out of the experience.


Are you interested in genetics, breeding for show, or supplying a local pet store?
Or are you simply in love with bettas and want to take your hobby to the next level?
Breeding for show or supply is a big undertaking that will require a large investment of time, space, and money. Due to the high start up and supply costs, it is very difficult to make a profit breeding bettas, so this should not be your goal for some time.;
, When you are ready to try breeding, you need to first prepare to bring your breeding pair home. Set up two tanks as shown in Set Up a Betta Tank. Be sure to cycle the water in both tanks before bringing home any fish.

, Bettas breed best when they are young, so you will have the most success if you find a reputable breeder either online or in your area to purchase a pair from. If you are able to find a breeder in your area, they can also be an invaluable source of information. Make sure the male and female are about the same size, and consider getting two pairs in case the first pairing doesn't work out.


Most pet store bettas are too old to breed and their genetic background is usually unknown, but they can be a cheaper way to get started breeding and are more readily available than breeder fish.
If you choose to breed pet store fish, be aware that you may be unable to find buyers or homes for your fry, as most pet stores will not buy them. Because you don't know what genetic traits you are mixing, you could end up with sickly or undesirable fry.

, It's best to have your bettas for a few months before you start breeding to allow them to adapt to their environment. Remember, however, that males breed best when they are no more than 14 months old. Plan to breed them when you have a long, uninterrupted stretch of free time.


Once you introduce the male and female, you will need to devote at least a few hours every single day for more than 2 months to caring for the pair and their young. Make sure you don't have any vacations, business trips, or high-stress events coming up.

, The breeding tank should be 5–10 gallons (18.9–37.9 L) and be equipped with a removable divider, a few hiding places, an adjustable filter (such as a sponge filter with a gang valve), and a heater set to around 80 °F (27 °C). Never add gravel or other substrate to the breeding tank because the eggs will get lost when they fall to the bottom. Only fill this tank with 5""-6"" of water, and set it up where there are few distractions, such as other fish, bright colors, and human activity.

, Live brine shrimp or blood worms are the best bet, but other worms, crickets, roaches, and other insects (cut up) will also work. It's a good idea to raise these yourself or purchase them from a pet store or breeder to avoid the bacteria, dirt, and chemicals that wild insects could be carrying. If live food is unavailable, you can also try frozen or freeze-dried brine shrimp and blood worms.

, Betta fry are very small, and only eat live food, so you will need a supply of very very small live food to feed them when they are ready. Start now to be sure you have a good supply in a few weeks when you need it. Microworms are probably the best food, but some breeders prefer infusoria or vinegar eels. Baby brine shrimp can also be fed, but only in moderation alongside another food source, as too much may cause swim bladder disorder.

, When the live food cultures are going strong and the breeding pair has been eating live food for a week or two, you are ready to introduce your bettas. Move the male and female so they can see one another clearly, but are separated. You can either put their tanks next to each other, or introduce them to opposite sides of the tank divider in the breeding tank. It is essential that they are able to see each other before being put together to minimize the risk of serious injury.


Some breeders release males into an undivided breeding tank and use a clear plastic cup or oil lamp chimney to introduce the female. When using this method, the female should only be introduced for a few hours each day, as she is being contained in a very small space. Let them watch one another for a few days.
Some breeders then separate the pair for a few days before introducing them for a few more days, then proceeding to the next step.

, Watch the bettas to see if they seem interested in one another. The male will swim around, displaying his fins, flaring and generally showing off. The female will display vertical bars on her body and will angle her head down submissively. Some aggressive displays are normal, but if they are flaring and trying to attack one another through the divider, do not put them together. Instead, it may be best to separate them and try again later, or try a different pair of betta. Some times the betta fish fight so it would be better if you take a little time to watch and wait.

, Once your male is ready to breed, he will build a large bubble nest which will take 2-3 days. When this happens, turn off the filter and release the female into the tank, but be sure to keep an eye on the pair. The male will probably bully her some, nipping at fins and chasing her around. This is ok as long as neither fish's life is in danger. This courtship may last several hours or even days. Be sure there are plenty of hiding places for the female to escape the bullying, and check on the pair regularly to prevent serious injuries.

, The male will finally get the female under his bubble nest and they will embrace. It may take a few embraces to produce eggs. Then the female will go into a 'zombie-like' state while the white eggs fall to the ground from her little white ovipositor. The male will swim down and scoop them up, putting them one by one into the nest. Some females will help with this once they recover, but others will eat the eggs, so watch carefully and remove her if she is eating them. They may embrace many more times, but eventually the female will stop releasing eggs.

, Once the female is done releasing eggs, the male will bully her again, and she will hide. Gently scoop her out and put her into her own tank. Treat her tank with Maroxy to help her fins heal. It is a good idea to treat the breeding tank with Maroxy, too, to prevent fungus from killing the eggs.

, This will be about three days after hatching. Some breeders will not feed the male at all during this time. This is supposed to reduce the risk of the male eating the eggs and fry. Other breeders will feed him a small amount of food every second day. If you choose to feed him, do not be alarmed if he does not eat right away, but continue to offer the food, and gently remove uneaten food with a turkey baster. Keep the filter off to prevent any current from disturbing the fry, but keep the tank light on day and night.

, When the fry initially hatch they will hang from the bubble nest, and the male will replace any that fall. After a few days, the fry will begin ""free-swimming,"" swimming horizontally and venturing away from the nest. Before this, the fry will be feeding on what's left of the egg yolk, and can not eat on their own.

, He can return to his normal routine and feeding schedule. If he is still looking ragged from the courtship, add some Maroxy to help him heal.

, As soon as you remove the male, feed the fry a small portion of live microworms. Feed twice a day, and watch closely to see how much is eaten. If live microworms are still present when it is time for the next feeding, you can skip it since the fry still have food. If you see many dead microworms, you are overfeeding, so cut back on the portions. Fry need to be fed very small, living food such as,



Infusoria: These will feed the fry for their first week of life;
Microworms: you will need to buy a starter culture, after that you never have to buy them again. Good for fry 3-40 days old;

Baby Brine Shrimp: These are easy to hatch and are the easiest to control how much to feed, but feeding too much will result in swim bladder disorder;

, Keep the fry warm at 80 °F (27 °C) and cover the tank to prevent drafts and evaporation. Continue to feed increasing amounts of food. When the fry outgrow the breeding tank, they will need to be moved to a larger tank. Not all fry will survive the first few weeks, but if you see large numbers dying each day, you probably have a problem. Check temperature, chemical levels, and consider the possibility of treating for infections.


When the fry are a week old, turn on the filter, but restrict the flow with a gang valve so it is barely noticeable.
When the fry are two weeks old, begin performing small (10%) water changes every few days to keep the tank clean and free of dead food, but use a gentle siphon or turkey baster to prevent injuring the fry, and add clean water very slowly. You can begin turning off the tank light at night.
Over the next few weeks, gradually increase the flow of the filter, watching fry carefully to be sure they are strong enough to swim against the current.

, By the time the fry are two weeks you should move them to at least a 20 gallon (75.7 L) tank. Make sure the temperature and water in the tank are the same as what the fry are used to. Fry are delicate — one slip up could result in them dying. If you used a half-filled five or 10 gallon (37.9 L) tank you can fill the tank up and move them when they are 4-5 weeks old.

, When the fry are about a month old you can gradually start switching the fry to frozen and then freeze-dried and flake or pellet food. Make sure the food is crushed small enough for their tiny mouths. Offer small amounts, and wean them off the live food slowly. Always remove uneaten food.

, When the male fry begin fighting (anywhere from 5-8 weeks of age), it is time to remove them from the tank. Place them in individual tanks close to one another, as they can become depressed if suddenly isolated.


Males that are not fighting can be left with the females until they become aggressive.
Some males will refuse to eat the first day or two; try feeding them live food to stimulate their appetite.
Continue to separate out all male and aggressive fish as they become apparent. In the following days and weeks you will want to begin isolating the males with opaque dividers, as they will stress each other out, flaring and trying to attack the males in adjacent tanks.

, If you are selling your fry, you will want to start contacting potential buyers. Most fry will begin to display their adult traits by 10-11 weeks, and you can begin to select the best fish for future breeding or take pictures to send to buyers. If you are trying to create a genetic line, you will only want to select the best few fish from each spawn to continue breeding, and sell or give away the others, or you will quickly find yourself with more bettas than you can possibly take care of.

, This takes time and experience to see; sometimes experienced breeders find themselves accidentally putting two males together.


Males have longer fins, however young males have short fins.
Males flare at each other. Females usually won't, but females can be just as aggressive as males.
Females have an egg spot, which is located on her belly; this is where eggs are released during spawning.
Males blow bubble nests; if you jar a Betta and it blows a nest, it's a male. However, some females also blow bubble nests, so be sure to double-check.

Take ongoing care of your betta.",How to Care for a Crowntail Betta Fish," Although bettas are typically ""used"" to living in very small spaces, they should be given the opportunity of a bigger home, being that they are kept in captivity.


Bowls may not be the best choice. If you can, choose a bigger sized home such as a 5–10 gallon (18.9–37.9 L) tank. These are bigger than the average bowl, but not as expensive as larger tanks;
, You'll need a filter to help maintain the tank's cleanness and the betta's health. Just go to your local pet shop and ask someone in the fish department about a suitable filter for your chosen tank.


You may be wondering if you'll need a heater for the tank; this is not necessary! For the most part, bettas can do well at temperatures around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, thought they are tropical. So unless your home is an ice box, don't worry about buying a heater.
The only other thing you will need to keep the tank healthy and lively is some aquarium dechlorinator. This can also be found at the pet shop. Be sure to choose a fit one for your tank and fish

, This is the fun part; you can choose gravel for your tank! When you're at the pet shop, take your time and have fun picking out some gravel for the tank. There are so many colors available! And in a range of sizes, from sand, to large river-sized rocks. Choose whatever fits your like and tank.

, Bettas, like any fish, will want a little privacy at times, and plants can provide that. Plastic plants are more popular, as they require less care than live plants (and aren't edible, either!). It's your choice.


Hide-aways can be in almost any shape or form these days, even the classic castle. And it's not just plants and hide-aways; there are lots and lots of just decorations. Perhaps you'd like to get a little something special to spruce up the tank for fishy?

, Fish food comes in lots of choices: pellets, flakes, dried (dead food), live food, etc. But which do you choose? Well, you're going to have to experiment a little on this one. Bettas can have their likes and dislikes. Yours may like flakes better than pellets, and vice versa. Or the same with dried or live food.


For now, just start off with some betta pellets and flakes. For a week, feed one of the two. If your betta doesn't seem to care for it that much (let alone eat it), try the other.

, After you've set up the aquarium, let the water sit for a day or so. This allows any chlorine in it to evaporate, although you'll still have to add some dechlorinator later.

, Bettas prefer water temperatures between 72–82 °F (22–28 °C). If the temperature is between those two, this will be great, and help your fish settle in.

, This is the best part. Now that you have the tank at home all set up, you can go and get your fish. Be careful, though. Not all fish are in health grade A. Some may be healthier than others, and you need to be careful that you don't end up with a sick fish.

, After you've allowed your betta to settle and get used to the water temperature (before you let your fish out of the bag it came in), you can now enjoy your new fish friend!

, Be sure to feed your fish once daily and clean the tank once a week. And be sure to watch for signs of illness.

Also do not play with the fish.Playing with it by putting your hands in will make it live a shorter life. Be sure to be nice for your betta!"

Select a proper pond.,
Purchase the Koi.,
Feed your Koi.,
Keep the water fresh.,
Be conscious of potential health problems.",How to Raise Koi," You can purchase a Koi pond made of several different materials from pet stores or Koi specialty retailers. A good rule of thumb is that the Koi pond measurements should be at least 3 feet (0.914 m) deep and contain 300 gallons (1136 liters) per fish. You may want to get a larger pond than you need right away, so that you can add additional fish later.;
, You can purchase Koi at online retailers, at specialty Koi farms, or in some cases at pet stores. Healthy Koi are not too lethargic or too energetic and swim vertically in the water. If possible, inspect your fish before purchasing them. A healthy fish is more important than a pretty pattern.

, Koi are omnivores. They eat a variety of fish foods and can eat cereal, vegetables, worms, and fruit. You can also purchase special Koi food. Some specialists recommend varying the food - even if it is just Koi food pellets, because some Koi will not eat newly introduced foods if they have become accustomed to a particular type of food.


In warmer weather, you can feed a Koi a small amount of food several times per day. Koi have a very small digestive tract, so you need to control the amount of food you give them.
In cooler weather, you only need to feed your Koi once per day.
Koi enter a hibernation process when the water temperature falls below about 46 F (7.7 C). It is not necessary to feed Koi when water temperatures are this low.

, While some Koi ponds are large enough to be naturally aerated, pumps and filters can ensure that the water in which your Koi live stays fresh. You may want to consider using Koi pond water additives. Two examples of additives are products designed to keep the water healthy and free of pests. (Remember to be careful what you add to your water solution, as it could potentially hurt or even kill your fish. I.e. Pesticides, Removers, etc.)

, To produce their spectacular colors, Koi are very inbred and have been for more than 200 years. Because of this inbreeding, domesticated Koi have weak immune systems. Common problems can be noted by watching the Koi at feeding time. Lethargy, a lack of feeding, or seclusion from other fish can indicate a problem. Koi are also vulnerable to parasites or to bacterial infection if they have received an injury. The primary key to a healthy Koi is clean water. If possible, quarantine a sick fish in a separate body of water. If the fish does not seem to be getting healthier, consult a veterinarian who treats fish.

Maintain your tank.",How to Care for a Betta Fish in a Vase," Where you place your vase will impact your Betta's health and longevity.Ideally you want a location away from noise and heat and has only a little natural light. Too much noise can cause stress and fin rot. Heat sources can cause dramatic fluctuations in water temperature. Excessive natural light can promote algae growth.;
, If you have decided that a vase with a live plant is the preferred setup for your fish, then the first step is to decide which vase will work best. In general, the bigger the vase, the better. The larger the vase, the more room your Betta has to swim around, which makes for a healthier, happier fish. Your vase should be no less than one gallon., Once you have the vase and location you want to decide what to put in your vase beyond your Betta. Most people include a plant, a tray, and gravel.


The most commonly used plant is a Peace Lily, a type of Spathiphyllum. Spathiphyllums are used because they are tropical plants that do not require a lot of sunlight or water to survive.
Bettas are jumpers. You need a tray that will sit above the surface of the water to keep your Betta from jumping out of the vase. Bettas will come to the surface and gulp air so keep the tray above the actual surface of the water.
Any type of gravel or rocks should be fine provided they are clean and free of any chemical traces. Glass beads or marbles do just fine.

, Put your gravel in first on the bottom of the vase. Use filtered drinking water to fill your vase.Avoid distilled water as the distillation process removes natural minerals needed for your Betta. Tap water will need to be dechlorinated. You will also need items and equipment for proper care. You will need fish food and may need a small water heater. Once you have everything together, let the tank sit for 24 hours before introducing your Betta to it.


Feed your Betta dailywith freeze dried blood worms, brine shrimp, or an appropriate Betta food. They are omnivores and require meat to survive.They cannot live off plant roots. Feed your fish once daily up to 5-6 days per week.Bettas are tropical fish and thrive in temperatures of 76-80 degrees Fahrenheit (24.4-26.6 degrees Celsius).Never let the tank drop below 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).If your room temperature is regularly in these ranges, you will be ok. If your room temperature is below these ranges, a small heater will be necessary.

, Once you have setup your vase its time to introduce your Betta to it. Remove anything restricting access to the water surface. If you Betta is not already in a clear plastic bag, transfer it to one using the same water they are in already. Set the bag on top of the water for 20 minutes. Then use water from the tank to double the water in the bag. Allow to sit another 20 minutes. This allows the water temperatures to equalize. Finally, flip the bag over and release the fish into the water.


If you are cautious about mixing store water with your own water, use a net to transfer your Betta after the last 20 minute rest.

, Your Betta needs to be fed properly, just like any other animal. Feed your Betta a small amount of food once a day. Specific Betta food can be purchased at your local pet store. Bettas are omnivores and require protein in their diet. They cannot live off the roots of the plant in your vase.The best types of food are: worms (live or frozen); brine shrimp (live or frozen); fruit flies; or pellets made specifically for Bettas.


Do not overfeed your Betta. To avoid overfeeding, feed your Betta on a regular schedule (i.e. the same time and amount everyday). Also, observe your Betta while you feed it. If it leaves some of the food uneaten, then you know you have feed it too much. You should only feed your Betta what it can eat in 3 minutes. Allow one to two days a week to be fasting days where you do not feed your fish at all., The water in the vase needs to be changed frequently. Because the vase is unfiltered, waste and other by-products from the fish and plant build up in the water. To change the water, you will need to temporarily relocate your fish to another, clean container. You can use water in the tank to fill the container. Empty the vase of all water and fill with filtered tap water or bottled drinking water. Allow the tank to reach room temperature before returning your Betta to it using a net.


Water changes vary by volume of water.Change your water every 3 days for a 1 gallon vase. If your vase is as much as 2.5 gallons, change your water every 5 days. If your tank is 5 gallons, you can change it once per week. Since the vase is unfiltered, these water changes eliminate ammonium, nitrates, and other harmful chemicals caused by the fish's own bodily waste.

, You should clean your vase during every water change. Once the vase is empty, wipe the entire inside of the vase down with a clean cloth or paper towel. Any scum or algae should be removed. Remember to rinse the accessories as well. Additionally, you should “clean” the plant by trimming off dead parts.


Avoid soap in the cleaning process. Soap or other cleaning materials could be harmful to the fish. Residue from the cleaning products can mix with the water and ingested by your Betta.

, One of the tell-tale signs your Betta is unhappy or in danger is changes to their color, behavior, or fins. When any change occurs, you should assess the situation quickly. You don't want your Betta to become ill when a small change could save their life. Visit a local pet store for specific advice on how to treat your Betta's condition.

, Even when you are doing weekly water changes you may find your water becomes unexpectedly cloudy or fluctuates temperatures. This may mean your vase has too much direct sunlight (algae is forming and the sunlight is heating the vase). Your heater or room temperature may not be in the proper range either. You need to ensure a temperature between 76-80 degrees Fahrenheit (24.4-26.6 degrees Celsius)., Betta's typically want a larger space than provided in a vase. Something in the range of 3-5 gallons is a good startbut larger is better.The goal is to give them plenty of room to swim and interact with the environment. While Bettas may be sold in tiny containers, this is more to facilitate shipping than anything else.

, There are many considerations when setting up a Betta tank. Presuming you understand how to setup a Betta vase, a Betta tank is only slightly more complicated. You will want to add a filtration system to the tank as well as more gravel and water than before. Plants and decorations are also a good addition. A lid to keep the Betta jumping out is important. A larger heater may also be required.Once you have setup the inside and added water, let the tank sit until the water is clear and heated to the proper temperature.


Avoid filtration systems that create a lot of current in the water. Bettas like to ""sit"" in one place and a current will stress them out.
Heaters should be appropriately sized to keep up with the quantity of water in your tank.The micro-heater used in your vase will likely not be sufficient for a 5 gallon tank. Be sure to get a heater designed for your tank's exact size.
Avoid plastic plants and abrasive decorations. Use silk or live plants from your local pet store's aquarium department. The same is true for decorations. These are designed to work well with your Betta tank's unique requirements.

, If you want to move your plant and Betta you will need to find a vase for your plant. Simply moving it from your Betta vase to a water-only vase should be sufficient. Wait until your tank is ready to move your Betta. Then transfer your Betta to a plastic bag by filling the bag half full of vase water and use a net to put your Betta inside.

, Once your Betta tank is all setup you can start transferring your Betta from their temporary plastic bag to their new home. Float the plastic bag on top of the water of the new tank. Wait 20 minutes and then fill the rest of the bag with tank water. After another 20 minutes you can flip the bag over to release the Betta.

, Live plants are generally more safe for Bettas as they tend to be soft and move freely in the water. Since you have more space additional fish may be added but you must be careful which fish., Tank maintenance can be more involved but less frequent than vase cleaning.With a tank, you can avoid frequent water changes and may only change a little at a time. You will need to change your filters regularly as well (check the filter box for regular changing intervals).If you have live plants you also must regularly remove any dead leaves."

Choose a tank for your betta.,
Prepare the tank.,
Fill up the tank with tap water.,
Purchase a water conditioner.",How to Acclimate Your Betta1," In their natural habitat, bettas live in murky, stagnant water. Although they can survive in very small, cramped tanks, it’s healthier for the fish to give it a larger environment. Look for a tank that is holds around five gallons of water, as this will give the fish plenty of space. Do not keep your betta in a tank smaller than one gallon.Since betta fish breathe air directly from the top of the water, your tank does not need a filtration system. In fact, it’s better if the tank doesn’t have one—the current created by the filtration is stressful to bettas.;
, Wash the fish tank thoroughly and then rinse the gravel carefully in hot tap water. Do not use soap or detergent on the gravel. Then layer the gravel carefully at the bottom of the tank. Rinse any decorations and put them into the tank.


The tank does not necessarily have to be a traditional fish tank; any gallon-sized container will do.It’s important that you include gravel in the fish tank. Opt for a neutral color, and for relatively small-grained gravel. The neutral color will calm your betta, and bacteria that build up on the gravel will digest your fish’s waste and keep the water relatively clean., Do not use mineral water in the tank, since it lacks important minerals that your betta fish will need.It’s important that, when filled with tap water, your fish tank will have plenty of surface area at the top. Betta fish do not breathe air dissolved in the water, but must come to the surface to breathe.


For this reason, a narrow-topped container like a wine bottle does not make a suitable tank for a betta., A conditioner will remove chlorine (which is unhealthy for fish) from your tap water, and also filter out other impurities and heavy metals.Follow the instructions on the conditioner bottle, and remember to add this as you fill the tank with water. You’ll also need to add conditioner every time you change the water in the fish tank (roughly once a week).If you bought your betta at a pet store, you should have received a water conditioner specifically made for bettas. If you were not given one, you’ll need to purchase a conditioner on your own.Conditioners should be available at any pet store, and can also be easily purchased online.
The amount of conditioner that you use will vary based on the size of your fish tank. Follow the directions on the bottle regarding the amount of conditioner to use, and the amount of time to let it mix in the water before it’s safe for your fish.If you live in a rural area where the tap water is not chlorinated, you may not need to use a conditioner.

Look for breathing problems.,
Watch for your betta to rub or scratch.,
Look for other physical symptoms.",How to Tell if a Betta Fish Is Sick1," When a betta gets sick, his coloring may look faded out. He may even lose his color altogether., In a healthy betta, its fins will be whole. An unhealthy betta may develop holes or rips in its fins.Another unhealthy sign is if your betta's fins appear clamped down to the body; that is, they aren't fanned out properly., If your betta is sick, his activity level will go down. He won't be his normal, active self. His movements will slow down some.Another sign of sickness is your fish hiding out at the bottom of the tank more often than normal., With some sicknesses, your fish may stop eating altogether. If your betta appears uninterested in food, he could be sick., Look for small, white spots, especially around the head and mouth. This symptom can be a sign of a certain type of parasite, called Ich., It may sound funny to check a fish for breathing problems. However, if your betta is constantly at the top of the tank trying to get more air, that is likely a sign of a problem., If your betta is trying to rub against the side of the tank, that could be a sign of a problem. Similarly, if your betta is trying to scratch on plants or objects in the tank, he might also be sick., Bulging eyes can be a sign of sickness. Watch for your betta's eyes protruding from its head.Raised scales can also be a symptom of sickness.Watch his gills. If he's unable to close his gills, they may be swollen, another sign of sickness."
"
Float the bag at the top of the fish tank.,
Mix the water from the tank with the water in the bag.,
Let the water sit for 15 minutes.,
Release the betta into the fish tank.",How to Acclimate Your Betta2," Before you do this, make sure the bag has enough air so the betta can breathe. Letting the bag float at the top of the betta’s new tank will allow the water in the bag (with the betta in it) to match the temperature of the water in the tank.This process is known as “floating” the betta.
Let the bag sit in the tank for 10–15 minutes.

, Once the bag has floated in the fish tank for about 15 minutes, you can start to expose your betta to the water in the fish tank. Use scissors to cut a hole in the bag. Using a baster or a small cup, pour about a cup of the tank water into the bag.You’ll need to stand there and hold the bag upright during this time. If you release the bag or let it tilt too far to one side or the other, the water will spill out into the tank.

, Your betta needs this time to slowly adjust to the temperature, pH level, and mineral hardness of the water in the tank.If you rush these steps and do not give your betta time to acclimate to the water, it will be harmful to the fish’s health.


Repeat the step one more time: mix another cup of tank water into the bag with the betta.
Continue to hold the bag in the tank during this time. Make sure to keep the cut in the bag facing upright.

, After acclimating the fish for roughly 30 minutes, take the bag, turn it sideways, and allow the betta to swim out. Your betta may take some time to get used its new surroundings, but it should be comfortable living in the water of its new tank at this point.If the water in the betta’s bag is dirty, minimize the amount that gets into the fish tank. Dirty water in your tank is never a good thing!
After the fish has been acclimated, you can also take an aquarium net and gently place your betta in the tank.
Do not feed your betta right away. The fish will probably not eat for the first day it’s in a new tank. Some bettas will refuse to eat for the first three days, sometimes even a week.

Float the cup containing your betta at the top of its new fish tank.,
Pour some of the tank water into the cup.,
Add a little bit more of the tank water.,
Transfer your betta from the cup to the fish tank.",How to Acclimate Your Betta3," At this stage, you want your betta to get used to the water and its temperature.A sudden exposure to the (probably colder) water of the fish tank would be harmful to your betta.


Let the cup float for about 15 minutes.

, Do this slowly, using a baster or a small cup. Do not pour the tank water directly onto the betta; pour the water off to the side of the fish. At this point, the cup should still be floating in the fish-tank water.The betta needs to get used to some of the tank water, as it will have a different mineral hardness and pH level, in addition to a different temperature.
Leave this to sit for 15 minutes.

, You want the tank water and water from the cup to be very well mixed—almost at a 1:1 ratio—before you place the betta fish in the tank. Again, wait for 15 more minutes.At this point, you can use your fingers to feel the temperature of the fish-tank water and the cup water. They should be roughly the same temperature.

, Using an aquarium net, gently take your betta out of its cup and move it into its new tank. Be gentle, as you do not want to poke or harm your new fish.


If the water in the betta’s cup is relatively clean of excrement and silt, you can pour the fish and its water directly into the tank.

Look for signs of swelling.,
Stop regular food for several days.,
Feed him live food.,
Don't feed him as much.",How to Tell if a Betta Fish Is Sick2," If your betta fish suddenly swells, he may be constipated. You need to treat this problem soon., The first way to help constipation is to stop his regular diet for a few days. That will give him time to digest and move food through his system., After a couple of days, start feeding him again. However, you should stick to live food for a little while.For live food, you can feed brine shrimp or blood worms. The general rule on how much food to provide is give enough food so that your betta can eat for two minutes. Do so twice a day., Constipation is generally a sign you are feeding your betta too much. Therefore, once he starts eating normally again, you need to feed him less than you were."

Look for shredded tails and fins.This disease can affect just the tail or just the fins.,
Change the water.,
Use a medication.,
Repeat the process.",How to Tell if a Betta Fish Is Sick3," However, it gives them a shredded appearance.Also, look for darker coloring near the end of the tail.Watch for white patches with fungal infection. This disease is most often noticed by the white patches that appear on your fish. He may also have clumpy fins or be less active than normal. While a fungal infection is different from fin rot, they are treated in much the same way., The first step is to change out the water. Of course, you need to remove your fish to another container while doing so. This disease often develops from dirty water, so you need to provide a clean environment for your fish.You should clean the tank before putting water back in.The best way to clean the tank is to use bleach at a 1 to 20 ratio with water. Let the mixture sit in the tank for about an hour. You can leave the fake plants and scoop in this mixture but not the rocks or gravel, as they can absorb the bleachMake sure you rinse it several times after cleaning it.
For the rocks, bake them at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour. Let them cool before adding them back in., You will give your betta tetracycline or ampicillin, which you add to the water. How much you add depends on the size of the tank, but you will find directions on the package.You will also need to use a fungus eliminator. That will keep the growth out of the water.If your betta just has a fungal infection, he won't need tetracycline or ampicillin, but he will need fungus eliminator., Change the water at least every 3 days. Every time you change the water, add the medication back in. Only stop when the betta fins seem to be growing back in, which can take up to a month.For fungal infections, look for the white patches and other symptoms to disappear. When they do, treat the tank with Bettazing or Bettamax to help eliminate the fungus."

Shine a flashlight on your fish.,
Use Bettazing.,
Treat the whole tank.",How to Tell if a Betta Fish Is Sick4," One way to see velvet is to use a light directly on your fish. The light will help you see the shimmer of gold or rust that this disease can produce on the scales. Your fish will exhibit other symptoms, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, and rubbing or scratching himself against walls or items in the aquarium. He may also have clamped fins.This parasite can be prevented by adding aquarium salt and water conditioner to your tank on a regular basis.You need to add 1 teaspoon of aquarium salt for 2 1/2 gallons of water. You also need a drop of water conditioner per gallon, though always read the instructions that come with your water conditioner., This medication is the most effective against velvet because it has two agents in it that work against the disease. Add 12 drops per gallon of water.You can also use a medication called ""Maracide"".Continue treating until the fish doesn't exhibit symptoms anymore.

, You should still isolate the affected fish, but you should treat the original tank as well. This disease is very contagious.To isolate affect fish, you need to move them to a separate tank with clean water. You need to provide treatment to both tanks.

He may also stop eating.Like velvet, this parasite is preventable if you treat the water right.Add 1 teaspoon of aquarium salt for a 2 1/2 gallons of water. For water conditioner, use a drop per gallon of water, though always read the directions first., If you have a large community tank, you can try raising the temperature to 85 degrees Fahrenheit, which will kill off the parasite. However, don't do it if your tank is smaller, as you may mistakenly raise the water too much and kill off your fish., With ich, you should change the water. Also, take time to clean out the water, as noted under the section about fin and tail rot and fungal infections.In a smaller tank, you can remove the fish first, clean it, and then heat the water to 85 degrees Fahrenheit before putting the fish back in., Be sure to put in aquarium salt and water conditioner before returning your fish to the tank. That will keep the tank from reintroducing the parasite to your fish., Use one drop of this medication per gallon of water. You can continue to add it everyday until the fish gets better. The medication kills off the parasites.If you don't have ""Aquareisol"", Bettazing can be used in a pinch."

However, sometimes this problem is a symptom of another disease rather than disease itself.For instance, it can be a symptom of tuberculosis.If it is tuberculosis, the fish will likely not make it., For popeye, you should provide a clean tank, as noted in earlier sections. In addition, change out the water., Ampicillin will treat the problem if it's not a symptom of something worse. You need to add this medication every time you change the water and clean the tank, which should happen every 3 days. Continue this regimen for a week after you stop seeing signs of the problem."

Look at the color. Is the betta's color bright and vivid, or is it very dull? Even if the betta's color is a little pale, it should shine nicely. Bettas come in a variety of colors, but blues and reds (dark colors in general) are most common, although sometimes they can be white with a pink or blue tint.
Does the betta respond to your movement at all? Does it swim around rapidly when seeing you, or does it merely sit at the bottom and sulk? Don't repeatedly tap the container, as doing so agitates the fish. Instead, try moving your finger back and forth in front of the Betta without aggravating it. Don't be afraid to buy a somewhat docile betta though; they generally have many encounters with other people during their day, and may simply be resting. The average betta bought in a pet store has been bred to withstand a lot of the hassles of a pet's lifestyle.
Are its fins in good condition, or are they torn or otherwise damaged? Keep in mind that some breeds have intricate fins, so they might look slightly torn. Are the betta's eyes in good shape? Do you see any odd lumps (parasites) on its body? If you see anything highly out of the ordinary, consider another betta. (it would also be helpful to talk to a store employee)
Sometimes, the fish will choose you, not the other way around. If there is one betta that you look at, set down, move on from it, but are drawn back to it repeatedly, consider buying it. Even if it is not completely healthy, buy the fish you feel connected to, rather than the healthiest one there. He will likely heal up once out of the tiny cup and gets a fresh start in warm, clean water.;
, Know that these fish can live up to 10 years under the proper care, so do your research before buying. The minimum size tank for a betta fish is 2.5 gallons with a heater and filter. Please do not keep a betta fish in a bowl; it is terrible for their health and is very small! Your betta fish will not be happy or live as long., There is a lot to know about betta fish, even beyond the basics just outlined. In general, large box stores aren't in the business of providing detailed information, unless you happen to strike a betta enthusiast salesperson. As well as having the basic understanding of betta outlined above, you might consider researching more details about betta fish online at sites like bettafish.com, bettatalk.com, ibcbettas.org, etc. These sites will remain useful for you after purchase too, as you'll be able to ask questions, check up health and nutrition notes and find like-minded betta fans to share stories with.








, Have a proper set up ready before bringing home your new pet. This prevents possible mishaps.









Don't place a male Betta fish with another male, but females do fine together only if they have a docile personality and if you have five or more female bettas in an optimum tank size of 15-20 gallons, though 10 gallons will suffice (as long as an efficient amount of hiding spaces have been provided). This is called a betta sorority and is very hard to set up sometimes. If you only want two bettas, don't put them together just to be safe. If you want another fish with your Betta, choose a fish that doesn't have long fins (do not get a guppy) and is roughly about the same size as the betta. Bigger fish will eat the betta, and the betta might eat any fish smaller than its mouth. A few good suggestions for tank mates are Red Cherry Shrimp and White Cloud Mountain Minnows.

, In the wild, bettas inhabit Thai rice paddies. Hence, they are suited to living in relatively shallow, but spacious environments. To meet the spacious need, consider giving your betta a decently sized tank to help prolong its life. Pick a tank of 5 gallons (19 liters) or more for your betta to thrive. It may seem like a lot, but it's what your fish deserves.








, Various equipment is required for the successful keeping of Betta fish:









Purchase a heater with a thermostat––Betta fish like water temperatures between 78-82ºF/24-27ºC. Bettas need a heater in all cases (they are tropical fish)––for example, if you live in a cold country or if you have an aquarium below room temperature, then a heater is required. Mini-heaters are available for betta tanks between 1-3 gallons (4-11 liters). During the winter, you may want to add a mini heater or place your aquarium close to a radiator (1 meter/3.2 feet away), to prevent your Betta from becoming too cold.
Filters are always necessary but make sure the current is not too strong for your betta. Bear in mind that the long-finned varieties do best with as little current as possible. Some experts recommend the use of sponge filters, to protect the fins.
Avoid jagged rocks or decorations. Such decorations can easily tear betta fins. It's recommended that you check once a day that there are no tears in the betta's fins. If there are tears, first check the water quality, as tears are typically caused by poor water maintenance.
Avoid adding any hard plastic plants. Again, these can be rough on the fins. Use the 'pantyhose test': If a plastic plant will snag a pair of pantyhose when rubbed against it, then it will damage your betta's fins. Be safe and buy silk plants instead.
Live plants are a great idea. They're prettier than fake ones, and betta fish love lounging on the leaves and hiding in them to sleep. Live plants also help to oxygenate the water and keep the water cleaner for longer periods of time by absorbing ammonia which can be fatal to your fish.

, Betta fish tend to prefer being alone and may kill other fish and even snails if added to the tank. Some betta fish are fine with tank-mates such as snails, ghost or cherry shrimp and catfish, and consider that as long as the fish sharing the tank is not bigger, more colorful or fin nipping, it should be okay. Before adding any sort of tank-mate, do thorough research by asking questions of the retailer, reading in books about betta fish or checking online sites dedicated to betta fish. The article Buy Fish for an Aggressive Freshwater Aquarium can assist with choosing a tank-mate for your betta. If in doubt, leave the tank-mate out.









Male betta fish cannot live with other male betta fish. They are named Siamese fighting fish for a reason! In an aquarium setting, they will fight to the death in order to protect their living space, regardless of the size of the tank. If your tank does not have a partition, do not risk losing one or both of your betta fish by allowing them to live together.
Keep female betta fish either singly or in groups of at least five, to lessen any aggression. The tank must be at least 10 gallons (38 liters) and have several hiding spots if keeping multiple females. All females must be added at the same time. Don't place only two female betta fish in your tank. They establish a ""pecking order"" and having only two female fish means that the less dominant one gets picked on exclusively.
Female betta fish will fight males and vice versa. Don't put them in together. Read up on breeding them if you think you want to try it, but remember that breeding bettas is a huge commitment, and not something to be taken lightly.
Putting a mirror up to the side of the tank can cause a betta to flare because he/she thinks that there is a rival in his/her territory. This can stress out the fish, so avoid mirrors.

, Use a water conditioner such as Prime before putting fresh tap water in the tank. The chlorine and chloramines in standard tap water can harm bettas, as well as kill off all that beneficial bacteria housed in the filter. Older sources may suggest aging the water (standing it for a time) but it's best to use a water conditioner, as aged water removes chlorine but not chloramine and heavy metals. Use a master freshwater test kit to ensure that your tank is completely cycled before adding your betta!









It is a not a good idea to use bottled water because this deprives your betta of necessary minerals and is not fish 'safe'. Treated tap water is both a cheaper and better alternative.

, If the tank is without a top cover, fill it about 80% high to ensure your fish won't leap out. Bettas are very active and can jump over 3 inches/7.5cm when motivated! However, bettas usually won't be trying to escape if they're happy in their home.








, First, slowly and carefully add some of your tank water to the container in which you received your betta. Allowing the new water and old water to mix will make the water easier for your fish to adjust to––if the habitat water is much colder or warmer than the previous water, mixing waters will help allay any shock for the fish. Next, tip the cup into your new aquarium, but try to add as little water as possible from the container to the new home, since sometimes water from the pet store can carry diseases and other things that you don't want in your new tank. Be gentle as you tip in the betta!









Avoid netting a betta if possible, as this can damage the delicate fins. If you need to pick up a betta, try to use a small cup to scoop him/her up with care.

, Bettas are carnivores. Your betta's diet should consist of pellets specifically made for feeding betta, as well as a variety of other carnivorous foods. Frozen brine shrimp or blood worms are good options.









Check the ingredients of betta specific pellets and flakes. The first three should be protein based. Experts say that protein in the pellets should be no less than 40%.

, Betta fish vary in eating habits from each other, so experiment to see how much food your Betta eats. Set up routine feeding times, for example, once in the morning and once at night. If you stick to this routine, you may even find that your betta will be waiting for you when it's time to eat!









Take care not to overfeed the fish. A betta's stomach is only about the size of their eye. Overfeeding can be a problem in some betta fish, as some fish will eat as long as you feed them (which can be fatal). A good feeding schedule is 3 pellets in the morning, and 3 at night. Soaking the pellets in water for a few minutes before feeding is recommended since the pellets will otherwise expand inside your betta's stomach, which can cause unhealthy bloating and digestive blockage. Overfeeding can cause bloating and bladder problems which can be fatal, although this is not as serious as a similar condition referred to as dropsy.

, Similarly, watch your betta to see if he/she spits up any food. This could be a sign that your betta is a picky eater, or it could also mean that the pellets are too big for the betta's mouth. Ironically, most big fish food companies don't realize that Betta fish have smaller mouths than, say, goldfish or others.









You can cut the pellets in half with a small razor blade or such to allow it to fit in the betta's mouth easier. If it still refuses to eat, try another brand of pellets or dried food.

, Put a straw in the tank and watch your betta to see if he/she gets used to it. If he/she does, and you have leftover betta food he/she won't eat, place one of the leftover pellets in the tank. Place the straw over it so that it is inside the straw. Hold the straw over the fish and wait for him/her to find it. After your betta finds it, he/she will follow it. You can then slowly lift the straw up to the top of the tank until the food pops out and your betta will eat it.








, Betta's thrive best in an already cycled tank with a filter, unless you are doing extremely frequent large water changes (but this can be stressful for the betta). Slow flow or sponge filters are recommended due to the betta's fragile fins. Vacuum the bottom of the filtered tank gently when doing routine small water changes. There are many symptoms of dirty water, such as, fin rot. Not to worry, the problem is easily treatable.









Be sure to add a dechlorinator (also known as a water conditioner) to the water; this will remove any harmful chlorine/chloramine that is in tap water that may kill your fish. It will also filter bacteria.
Be sure that the water you are changing is the same temperature as the old water the betta was in, to avoid temperature shock; such shock can be deadly to your betta. Use an in-tank thermometer to check the water temperatures.

, In order to test water parameters each week, you will need a master freshwater test kit. This will allow you to monitor your aquarium and take readings. Follow the instructions for testing provided by the manufacturer.









Place notes in your calendar or diary to remind yourself that it's time to test the water.

, Betta fish come to recognize their owners. They will actually learn faces and even simple games. Keep your betta company and say ""hi"" once in a while, so he learns who you are!









Betta fish are very curious and often develop a strong bond with their caretaker.

, Betta fish are enjoyable to watch and spend time with. You can play with your fish by moving your finger back and forth along the tank edge (never bang the tank or poke the water). Watch your betta follow you. And above all, don't forget to name your fish!









Never tap the glass of the tank. This action easily agitates the fish and can cause the fish to go into shock and die. To interact through movement, simply slowly rest your finger on the glass and slide it along to see if your betta will follow it. If he/she backs away and seems frightened, then stop immediately. You can eventually try again once you the betta is more accustomed and less afraid of you. Never put a mirror in front of the fish, as while they may change color and show off, it stresses them out.

Do Your Homework!,
Purchase the Necessities!,
Look up a detailed list of what you will need but here are the keys to caring for goldfish.,
Now add your hood and light, food, live or artificial plants, water conditioner, test kits, air pump and air stone for oxygenation of the water etc.,
Change Water!",How to Create and Maintain a Goldfish Aquarium," Before you can care for any kind of fish, you will need to do some research. This can be done through the Internet, books, or fish experts that are willing to hand over some advice to beginners. On the Internet, you can find loads of information on fancy goldfish and their needs, as well as advice from professionals or goldfish breeders who have published tips and tricks for confused amateurs. Books are truly the key to success in just about any hobby you wish to do well in. Most goldfish manuals and guides are written by experienced hobbyists and breeders who know well what they're talking about.;
, Go to your local pet store or search online for the best deals and keep an eye out for sales.

, *A Tank, obviously. The standard rule of thumb for fancy goldfish is 20 gallons (75.7 L) for the first fish, and 10 gallons (37.9 L) for each additional fish. When they're young, and with excellent filtration and frequent water changes, you can often get by with 10 gallons (37.9 L) per fish. But keep in mind, you may have to upgrade your tank in a year or a couple years as they grow older and larger. * A filter is a necessity.


For goldfish, who produce massive amounts of waste when compared to the average tropical fish, a filter with a Gallons Per Hour (G.P.H.) rate of 10x the tank's water volume or more is needed. For example, a 20 gallon (75.7 L) goldfish aquarium will need a filter with a 200 G.P.H. rate. A 30 gallon (113.6 L) tank will need 300 G.P.H. A 40 will need 400 G.P.H., simple as that. Of course, more than that is awesome, the more filtration the better.






The two filters recommended for your aquarium would be a standard power filter that hangs on the back of the tank (HOB) or a canister filter which usually sits below the aquarium. Canister filters are very expensive but are an excellent source of filtration if you can spare the money. But no need to worry, HOB filters are fantastic, readily available, fairly inexpensive, and easy to maintain! It has a fairly large media basket where you have three levels of filtration. A foam block to catch debris, either carbon to help keep the water clear or more foam or filter floss for more stopping of the debris, and finally the magnificent ceramic rings. These pellets are small but due to the many crevices each one has approximately 100 sq. ft of surface area for beneficial bacteria to grow! Basically water is sucked into the filter and the beneficial bacteria converts highly toxic ammonia to less toxic nitrite to nitrate which is only toxic in large amounts. While other aquarium filters have only carbon which has very little space for B.B.'s to grow, and which is disposed of about once a month - that means your tossing your cycle!






With an Aqua-clear, you only need to replace one section at a time, meaning you will always have your cycle. The foam needs only to be replaced every couple of month or so; the ceramic rings lasting almost forever!







, Please don't use gravel, it makes water changes harder and makes it easier to not notice and miss bits of debris. A bare-bottom tank is usually a cleaner tank.

, Despite what you may have heard, small and infrequent water changes are not the way to go unless you have delicate tropical species that produce far less waste. With goldfish, you will want to perform frequent and large water changes. I would recommend a 20-25% water change once a week. With inadequate filtration or when cycling, you may need to do a 80% water change, but never exceed that amount unless in an emergency. Toxic chemicals build up in a goldfish tank quickly and need to be removed often. Don't wait a whole month between water changes. This may work with tropicals, but not with goldfish. Unlike may people think, massive water changes won't rid your tank of all the beneficial bacteria. The B.B.'s are on your filter media, in the gravel bed (if you have one), on the plants, etc. and not in the water.

Examine the short length a Betta fish’s tail.,
Identify a long tail length.,
Determine if a Betta fish has a double tail.,
Identify a crown tail.",How to Identify Different Betta Fish1," Betta fishes have a variety of tail types. One simple way to identify a Betta fish is by the length of its tail. Short tails are common in wild type Bettas, as well as Bettas that are bred to fight.Short-finned Bettas, which are also called Plakats,are sometimes bred to have D-shaped tails.Since female Bettas typically have shorter tails than male Bettas, it can be challenging to determine the sex of short-finned Bettas.;
, Some Betta fishes will have long and flowing tails, which can be beautiful to look at. Long tails come in different shapes, such as veiled, halfmoon, and delta. Veiltail Betta are one of the most common types of Betta fish,and one of the most popular types of pet fish.The veiltail is long and flowing.It arches up and over the body, resembling a veil.The tail is usually asymmetric and broad at its base, and more pointed at its outer edge.The halfmoon tail looks like a half circle, or a capital ‘D.’ The perfect halfmoon shape has a spread of exactly 180° between the top and bottom tail rays. Sometimes, the half-moon shape can only be seen when the betta flares. Halfmoon tails are usually very fragile.There are also ‘over half-moon’ tails, which extend beyond a 180° tail spread angle.Delta tails are in the shape of a D, but do not achieve a 180° tail spread angle.Delta tails are sometimes called ‘Super Deltas,’ with a tail spread angle of 160° to 179°.The Delta tail usually has rounded edges, but the Super Delta tail tends to have a broad base and a wide end., As the name suggests, Double Tail Betta have two distinct tails. Ideally, the two tails are clearly split at the tail base.Double Tail Betta fish usually have a doubling and/or widening of their unpaired fins (dorsal and anal fins).With an even split at the tail base, the tail and unpaired fins should be mirror images of each other.The double tail is sometimes called a ‘full-moon’ tail., The crown tail has reduced webbing and individual tail rays that extend out.Crown tails come in a variety of colors and can be quite striking to observe.Crown Tail Betta are becoming increasingly popular in pet stores.The rays of a crown tail are typically long and straight, but may start to curl in response to unfavorable water conditions.Crown tails may be long or short. They are typically shorter on female Bettas than male Bettas."

Look at the solid coloration of a Betta fish.,
Identify different solid colors on the body and fins.,
Check for a marbled color pattern on a Betta fish.,
Look for a copper color pattern.,
Identify flecks of color on a Betta fish.",How to Identify Different Betta Fish2," Betta fish have been bred to come in a wide range of solid colors, including black, red, blue, and white. There can even be variations within a particular color family. For example, the coloration of a red Betta fish can range from bright to deep.Betta fish that are red as juveniles may lose their coloration as adults due to the Red Loss gene.For black Betta fish, the ideal coloration is pitch-black, or melano black. It is caused by a gene mutation that results in increased melanin. Melano females cannot breed eggs that will hatch, as the mutation kills the eggs. Black Betta fish are usually a smoky black.Some solid-colored Bettas will have a metallic look, due to pigment-containing cells called chromatophores., A Betta fish with one solid color on its body and another on its fins is considered bi-colored. Either the body is dark with light fins, or vice versa. There should be a sharp contrast and divide between the two colors. Two types of bi-colored Betta are butterfly and Cambodian.Butterfly Bettas have solid colors on their bodies, which partially extends to their unpaired fins. The outer edge of the fins will be a different color, creating a distinct band of color.Some butterfly Bettas have three colors, and therefore do not fit the strict definition of bi-colored. The three colors will still be distinct. An example of a tri-colored Betta fish is the Thai Flag Betta (red, white, and blue).Cambodian Bettas have flesh-colored bodies and deep red fins. Cambodian Bettas have lost popularity as new color patterns have been introduced., The marbled pattern will contain different colors with no distinct border between the colors. The colors usually look like splashes or blotches across the body and fins.Interestingly, the marbling can change from day to day.Most marbled Bettas have two colors.A tri-colored marbled Betta is known as a ‘koi.’ Koi usually have splotches of red and black on a light-colored body., The copper pattern actually contains a variety of colors (e.g., lavender, turquoise, purple), and is most obvious with the light from a flashlight. Ideally, there should be a roughly even distribution of colors between the body and fins. The body of a copper Betta will usually be blue with a metallic cover., Betta fish with speckles or flecks of color are called grizzle Betta. Grizzle Betta will have random flecks or spots of color on their bodies and fins. The random coloration is usually iridescent."

Observe the coloration and fin shape.,
Look for a beard.,
Identify a small white dot behind the ventral fin (underside front fin).",How to Identify Different Betta Fish3," In general, female Bettas are less colorful than male Bettas. In addition, the female Betta tails are not as long or showy as those on male Bettas. In fact, the female Betta tail is more likely to be round.Because young male Bettas do not have long fins, fin shape cannot be reliably used to determine sex in young Bettas., The beard is not an actual beard. – It is a membrane under the gill cover. In males, it can be seen when the gill covers are closed or open. Female Bettas also have a beard, but it is visible only when the gill covers are open.Male Bettas flare (open their gill covers and expand their beard) to make themselves look bigger to another male Betta., The small white dot is present only on females. It is the ovipositor or ova—the location where a female produces her eggs. This small white dot is more apparent in an adult female Betta.The ova may be difficult to identify in a young female Betta, making it more challenging to determine the sex."

Add more non-aggressive fish if you like.,
Keep the water temperature at 65–75 °F (18–24 °C).,
Feed your goldfish.,
Have a good, strong filter.",How to Care for Shubunkin Goldfish," Shubunkin Goldfish get very large, so a 50 gallon (189.3 L) tank is the smallest tank you can keep one in. Keep the live plants to a minimum; Shubunkins will uproot them.;
, Shubunkin Goldfish are peaceful schooling fish that mix well with other goldfish of the same size and shape. Make sure there is at least one other fish with your Shubunkin.

, Shubunkin Goldfish are cold water fish, so make sure what you put with them is okay with low water temperature.

, Shubunkin Goldfish eats flakes and/or pellets once or twice a day, and you should also vary their diet. They're omnivores, so you'll have a variety of options.

, Shubunkins are rather messy.

Watch for signs of not getting along.",How to Have a Happy Betta Fish," A healthy betta eats vigorously, swims around and is active, is colorful and vibrant, has fins and a tail that spread out like fans, and has scales and a body that look slick and clean., Sometimes, a betta acts sad because he is sick. If your betta is lethargic, check the tank's temperature and test the water. You may need to do a water change or turn up the heater. Signs of a sick betta are: Does not eat at all or eats reluctantly
Is inactive; stays in a corner of the tank, lays at the bottom, or is always at the surface
Purposely runs into objects, as if in an effort to scratch itself
Looks pale, grey, or generally dull in color
Tail and/or fins are clumped, closed, stiff looking, or falling apart
Body has open sores, white cottony patches, red spots or white spots, or lumps
Eyes are protruding or swollen looking
Gills don’t close all the way and stay half-open; they may look swollen or red
Scales are raised like a pine cone
Belly looks either hollow or extended and swollen, There are several common betta illnesses that can be treated if diagnosed correctly, but you should be sure about what your fish has before starting treatment. Some medicines work for several different types of fish illnesses, but you should be sure to get the correct one. Some common fish illnesses are: Fungal infection: look for white cottony patches on body and head, closed up fins, pale color, less activity
Tail and/or fin rot: look for fin and tail getting shorter, falling apart, having a darker color, less activity and reluctant eating
Ick: look for small white spots (like the body was sprinkled with salt), less activity and eating, and attempted scratching against rocks or plants
Velvet: look for less activity, loss of appetite and color. Velvet (a parasite) can be hard to spot so use a flashlight and look for a fine gold or rusty mist on the fish’s body
Dropsy: look for a big, extended belly and scales that are raised and look like pine cones. Unfortunately this is one disease for which there is no known treatment; it is thought to be a bacteria that causes kidney failure, and may be linked to feeding live worms to a betta., If you keep other fish or water animals (snails or frogs) with your betta as companions, you’ll need to remove your betta from the communal tank to treat it. You don’t want to treat healthy fish or water animals if they aren’t sick, though a complete water change for the whole tank is a good idea if you have one sick fish. Your sick betta may need to be isolated for up to 3-4 weeks while it gets better. Go to your nearest pet store and look for medicines that treat the various illnesses listed above; they will all most likely contain types of antibiotics (tetracycline, ampicillin) or anti-fungals (maracin)., Do this if your fish seems sick and you cannot determine what is wrong, especially BEFORE beginning treatment. It is not a good idea to treat your betta with the wrong medicines, because this could make him sicker., Bettas need a tank that holds a minimum of 5 gallons (18.9 L). Bettas also need a heater, as they are tropical fish that prefer temperatures from 76–84 °F (24.4–28.9 °C), and a filter. Be sure to have cycled the filter, too.Be sure to always check that your heater is working properly, because a heater that makes the water too hot for your fish (over 82 degrees Fahrenheit) is also bad for the fish and can harm him.
A filter is necessary. For smaller tanks, get a special low-current one. A regular filter in a small tank may create too much current for the fish. Do not aerate your fish’s tank, as this might create too much movement in the water for your betta's likings. Betta fish like mostly still or very low current water.

, Betta are happiest when they have clean water, so be sure to do a 10% water change every week for 5–10 gallons (18.9–37.9 L), twice a week for tanks 2.5 gallons (9.5 L).


A 10% water change means that you remove 10% of the water and replace that amount with clean water. Many people use distilled or spring water, but dechlorinated tap water is better, as drinking water lacks some minerals that are good for fish.
Contrary to some beliefs, betta do NOT survive in tiny puddles or filthy environments. Their natural environments are large rice paddies and slow moving streams. In most cases, the bigger the betta tank, the better.

, Direct sunlight and air conditioning will make large temperature fluctuations, which are harmful to the betta. Bettas are happiest in water that steadily remains 78-82 degrees Fahrenheit.

, Betta love having places to hide. Tunnels, caves, and plants (live or artificial) are all great decorations for a betta tank. If you choose artificial plants, silk plants are a great option, as they are less likely to damage a betta's fins. Live plants (called “betta bulbs” at pet stores) are popular and bettas like them, just make sure that they don’t become too big for the tank. They can be trimmed down if they do. Betta need to have room to swim around, so be sure to not overcrowd the tank with decor. It is recommended to have one area clear for swimming, and another for when your betta wants to hide., A well fed betta is a happy betta. There are many brands that carry fish food specifically made for betta fish on the market, and you should avoid giving bettas food that is made for other types of fish, even tropical fish.


The types of food made for betta are usually pellets or flakes made up of whole fish meal, shrimp meal, whole dried krill, and some other vitamins and soybean and/or whole wheat flour. Betta are carnivores, so they need a varied and high protein diet. If you can spare the extra expense, you can feed bettas mosquito larva, live brine shrimp, live worms, or frozen and/or freeze dried live food. Be extra cautious when feeding betta live food, however, for the reasons explained in step 3. Also, be sure that live food is fresh (not rotted) and clean (rinse it with clean water first) or you risk giving your betta an illness such as Dropsy., Feed only what he can eat within two minutes. This is very important. If you feed twice a day, you should feed less (only 2-3 pellets) each time. Bettas have small appetites, so you don’t want to overfeed them. Uneaten food left in the tank will contribute to poor water quality and may lead to disease in your betta., If your betta has an extended belly (it sticks out a lot near the lower fin), you may be feeding him too much. This can cause bladder problems in some types of betta. Especially beware of overfeeding if you ever feed your betta live food (mosquito larva, live brine shrimp or worms). They are more prone to overeat when offered live food. It’s even okay to skip feeding for a day once a week, to let the digestive system of your betta rest., Many betta like to hear their person's voice. You may notice that your betta swims more actively when you talk to the tank. You can also move your finger around on the glass of the tank, or wiggle it at the surface of the water. He will try to jump toward it. Just be careful not to let him jump out of the tank. Betta fish are curious fish, and they like to play! He or she might follow you around the room when you walk around too., Having different decorations that you switch out at different times give your betta more of a variety of things to look at, and will keep his life enriched.

, If it is female, it MAY like the company of two or three other female betta fish. It is recommended to have more than two so they won't fight constantly if they are aggressive to one another. This is called a “female betta sorority tank.” Be prepared, however, to keep them in separate tanks if they do not get along.Male bettas most definitely CANNOT live with other male bettas. They will attack each other, which is why bettas are nicknamed “Siamese fighting fish.” A male betta can be in a tank with female betta for breeding purposes, but you should leave this to professional aquarium breeders, or when you get more experienced with fish-keeping.

, Again, some betta, male or female, will never get along with others in the tank. Suggested possible tank mates for betta are apple snails, ghost shrimp, red cherry shrimp, African dwarf frogs, cory catfish, and neon tetras., If you do introduce other fish or animals to the tank, you’ll need to keep a careful eye on them. Signs include damaged fins or bodies in the other fish or water animals. You may not always see the betta attacking, but keeping a careful eye on the health of the other fish or animals in the tank is necessary. Do they look hurt? Are any of them hiding constantly? These could be signs that the betta is being aggressive toward them, and you should separate the betta for the well-being of your other fish or water animals in the tank. If you do not have a tank divider or a separate tank ready, then try adding more decorations to provide hiding places for the victims and ease for the aggressor.Treat the hurt fish first.


Make sure to avoid colorful, aggressive and fish with long fins such as guppies as tank mates. Also, while neon tetras are usually okay, some other types of tetra are “fin nippers” (such as serpae tetras) so be sure to research what type you’re thinking of getting if you want to get tetras as company for your betta."

Buy an appropriate aquarium.,
Obtain a good filter.,
When you clean the filter, don't throw the inserts and filter media away as this is where the beneficial bacteria live.,
Get some gravel and décor.,
Get the right food.,
Try to vary food on a daily basis i.e.,
Make sure that you have bought everything you need for your fish.,
After cycling, you are ready to add your fancy goldfish!,
When adding the goldfish, let their bag float in the aquarium water for 15-20 minutes.

,
Turn the bag inside the water and let the fish swim in the tank.",How to Care for Fancy Goldfish," A single adult fancy goldfish needs a 30 gallon tank, with another ten gallons per additional fancy goldfish. This equates to 140 litres for the first fish, and 45 liters per additional fish. The ""goldfish bowl"" is much too small and doesn't let enough oxygen get to the goldfish. Plus, it will absolutely stunt the growth of your fish. Leave bowls for flowers at weddings!;
, Whatever the total amount of gallons is, you multiply it by ten and get the answer for the gallons pumped per hour (GPH).


Lets say you have a 30 gal. Just do this simple equation: 30x10=300. You can either get a filter that says ""made for 30 gallon tank"" on the box or get a filter that pumps 300 gallons of water per hour. For more fragile fish, such as the Bubble Eye, get an under gravel filter (the Bubble Eyed goldfish's eye sack can get sucked into a regular filter and tear). Heaters aren't a huge issue, but the temperature needs to be between 65-75 degrees. It is important to have a thermometer handy.

, Instead, rinse them in a bucket of old tank water (not tap water). Media only needs to replaced when it falls apart and should last for years. Without a filter, tanks will foul and become deadly in just a day. Keep in mind that having a filter doesn't mean you can avoid cleaning the tank. Even with a filter, change 25% of the water every 2-3 months.

, Goldfish generally like to scan the bottom of the tank and move things around with their mouths. Make sure the gravel is small enough that it won't get stuck in their throats. Your gravel should be big enough, however, that the fish also would be able to grab it. Some hiding places would be great, shop bought wood and lots of plants offer intrigue, but nothing sharp or it could injure the fish (especially the bubble eyed goldfish). Rearrange the wood and plants on a monthly basis to offer the goldfish ""new"" areas to explore. Lots of live plants are great. They add some interest but are often readily eaten. Cheap bunches of Elodea should be seen as a sacrificial plant and can be replaced every 1 to 2 weeks. Try to mass plant or these can just be left floating. Anubias or Java Fern tied onto wood seem to be quite gold proof. They like moss balls too. Real planted tanks aren't needed, silk plants can be used with great affect but it's nice for the fish to have some 'greens' to hand if they fancy a munch.

, They shouldn't have flake food, because they can gulp down air and that can cause problems. Slow sinking goldfish pellets are best and if you buy the right brand, it can enhance the color of the goldfish and make them more active and brighter in color.

, pellets am, frozen food (Blood worm etc)pm. Chopped up blanched veggies go down well as do unshelled chopped peas (a great natural unblock used as a laxative.

, If you need help, try Do a Fishless Cycle for further reading.

, Remember to add only 1-2 fish at a time, depending on the size of the tank.

,, Never pour the water and fish in from above the fish or else it could harm your fish.


Alternatively, you can put a net over a bucket and pour your goldfish into the net, and proceed to lower them into the tank.

"
"
Get your tank.,
Know what type of goldfish you want.,
Buy from a breeder or an aquarium store.,
Look at the tank where the fish are kept.,
Observe and choose a fish.",How to Choose and Raise a Healthy Gold Fish," Contrary to popular belief, goldfish do not thrive in small bowls. A good rule is for every inch of fish = five gallons of water. That means if you plan on getting two common goldfish, your first tank should be at least ten gallons. Notice how that said ""first"" tank. When kept in healthy conditions, goldfish can grow to be anywhere from five to ten inches long, even if they are half an inch when you buy them. They also live up to twenty years, sometimes longer. Purchase the largest tank you can afford. If you don't buy a large aquarium in the beginning, you will have to continue purchasing larger tanks throughout the fish's lifetime. All tanks should have gravel/sand, a filter, and plastic or (preferably) live plants.;
, When most new fish keepers think of the word goldfish, the image that pops into their head is the little common orange fish you win at the fair. But there are many varieties of fish out there; Comets, Fantails, Black Moors, Pearlscales, Orandas, and hundreds more, ranging in price from thirteen cents to two-hundred dollars. Do some research to pick one that is suitable for your tank.

, Try not to buy them from pet stores. Aquarium stores often have fish in better condition and are more knowledgeable about fish care. Fancier fish may have to be purchased from a fish breeder and can often be shipped to you. Resist the urge to save some cash and buy a thirteen cent feeder fish. These fish are often unhealthy and of poor quality, and it only supports the industry.

, Is it relatively clean and free of waste? If a thermometer is visible, is the water between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit? Do other fish in the tank look ill? The living conditions of a fish have a big impact on a fish's health, so choose from a clean tank.

, Does it have white spots, or ich on it's body? Are it's eyes abnormally swollen? Does it have ripped fins? If it floating upside down, darting around or swimming lethargically? If the answer to any of these is yes, do not choose that fish."" Look for taught, clean fins and shiny scales. A fish should be swimming upright at a relaxed pace.

Wait until characteristics begin to develop with age.Male and female Betta fish will look very similar when young.,
Observe the size and shape of their fins.Male Betta fish will generally have long dorsal (top), ventral (bottom), and caudal (tail) fins.,
Note his or her colors.Males typically have bright colors.,
Look for the egg spot.Female Bettas will have a small white spot (the ovipositor tube) on their underside.,

Finding this spot may be difficult with younger females whose sexual organs have not fully developed.,
Compare their body shapes.Male and female Betta fish have subtle differences in body shape.,
Put a mirror beside or in the tank.",How to Determine the Sex of a Betta Fish1," This is because their body has not yet developed to the point where sexual characteristics are manifested. Wait until you can either see obvious male characteristics or at about two months of age before sexing your Betta.;
, Often 2-3+ times their body height. The dorsal and caudal fins will often droop due to their length. Female Betta fish will typically have shorter fins about as long as the Betta is tall or shorter. Female Betta's ventral fin may often resemble a hair comb.


Short fins may indicate female gender, but this characteristic should be combined with other evidence before sexing is conclusive.

, Females do not. Females tend to have subdued or dull colors, especially in the body. Bright blue, green, and red coloration in the body and fins is a good indication of a male Betta.


Colors can change depending on the stress level of the fish. Female Bettas will be more colorful when stressed than non-stressed females.

, This spot will resemble a grain of salt. It is located between the near the edge of the ventral fin near the head of the Betta. This is generally a fool-proof method of identifying females. However, some young male bettas can develop a false egg spot as a protection against other dominant males. This false egg spot will eventually disappear., As the fish ages and becomes larger, the ovipositor tube will become larger and easier to see.
If you are having trouble viewing the location of the spot, consider feeding or preparing to feed your fish. He or she will likely move to the top and angle himself or herself so you can more easily view the location.

, Males tend to be long and thin. Females tend to be shorter and thicker. This is a subtle difference. You will probably want to familiarize yourself with obviously male Betta fish to use this method to sex Bettas. Female Bettas almost look like stubby males when comparing body shape.

, Bettas will flare at other males.Both male and female Betta fish have aggressive tendencies. However, male are typically more likely to engage in aggressive behavior. When you place a mirror beside or in your Betta's tank, your Betta will see another Betta. Males will likely stretch or flare their gills to show dominance. They may even try to attack the mirror.


Female Bettas will sometimes flare to show dominance too. However, they do so with less determination. Males tend to become obsessed with the fact that another male is near them.
Do not leave the mirror in the tank for extended periods of time. While seeing your male Betta's aggressive display is fun, this can stress your Betta to the point it affects his or her health. Male Betta's fins, particularly, may start to shorten simply due to experiencing long periods of high stress.

Wash your hands!,
Unplug any heaters, filters, or lights before you start.,
Gather the tools and materials you will need.,
Scoop water out of the tank.,
Remove the fish from the tank.,
Empty the tank.,
Run the gravel under warm water.,
Rinse the tank and decor with warm water.,
Refill the tank.,
Wait for the water to settle and come to room temperature.,
Reintroduce the betta to its tank.",How to Clean a Betta Fish Tank," Take the time to make sure you don't have dirty hands. You want to make sure that you don't accidentally introduce germs or dirt into the tank while you clean it.


If you use soap, make sure to rinse it off thoroughly. Soap in the betta's tank can make it sick.;
, It is important to keep all electrical appliances unplugged and away from the tank while you are cleaning it. While these appliances should be made for use on a fish tank, you do not want them to accidentally fall into the tank or be otherwise submerged in water.

, In order to clean the tank you will first need to set up a safe and clean place to stash your fish. Find a clean cup or bowl that you can put the fish in. Take some of the water from the Betta's existing tank and place it into the glass or bowl; You will need just enough water so that the fish will have a little room to swim around. In addition, you will need the tools to clean and refresh the tank's water.


You will also need: a sink, a plastic cup or net to scoop the fish and water, paper towels and a scrubber to clean the inside of the tank, water conditioner (which is available at most pet or aquarium stores), a sieve to use when cleaning tank gravel, and a plastic spoon.

, Using a small cup, scoop out 50% to 80% of the water in the tank. Set it aside so that it can be used later on in the tank. This has to be done because you cannot change the water entirely, as it might put the betta into shock. Instead, you will put the water you set aside back into the tank, after it is cleaned.


If you are a new owner, you can start by 50% water changes and gradually increase it till you reach 80%.
Most of the filth in a betta's tank is in the gravel at the bottom. If you take the water off the top, then you will still be getting rid of most of the dirt and grime when you clean the gravel.

, Once you have removed some of the water from the tank, scoop your fish with the same cup. Take your time and be careful of the fish's fins. If you go really slow, you may be able to get the fish to settle into the cup while it is underwater, and then you can simply lift it straight up.


Place the fish into the glass or bowl that you have already filled with tank water.
Keep in mind that while doing this you need to make sure the fish doesn't jump out. Bettas are known jumpers, so put a lid on whatever container you are keeping the fish in.

, Drain the remaining water out of the tank through a sieve into the sink. This will prevent any gravel from falling down the drain.


Remove any decor that is in the tank as well. You can simply set it on top of the gravel in the sieve.

, Fold the gravel with your hand and shake it side to side to get the dirt, poo, and left over food out. Use your hands to do it really thoroughly., Use a soft scrubber to scrub the glass. Dry the decor well with a paper towel and put it to the side.


Never use soap on anything in a fish tank, including the tank itself.The residue is likely to remain and hurt your betta.

, Place the gravel and plants back into the tank before you refill it. Then pour new water into the tank and condition it. Follow the directions on the package of conditioner to determine how much conditioner to put in your fish's tank.


Use a plastic spoon to stir the water, making sure that the conditioner is mixed into the new water thoroughly.
Remember to reserve enough room for the original water that you took out of the tank. Pour the old water you reserved back into the tank once the new water has been conditioned. Stir it all together well.

, The tank water must be the same temperature as the water was before, and should be between 72 and 80 degrees fahrenheit.Your fish WILL die from stress if you change the temperature too quickly.


Water coming to room temperature could take awhile. Check the water after a half hour, using a thermometer to make sure the water temperature matches the ambient temperature in the room. If it is not room temperature, wait another half hour and then check it again.

, Slowly put the cup (where you kept your betta) into the tank and tilt the cup a bit. Your betta will slowly come out of the cup by itself. Be gentle while you're doing this, as you might hurt it's fins.


Keep an eye on the betta. Once you let it go, it'll soon start exploring the tank. Set your tank back to where it was and enjoy as it swims around observing everything!

Consider the method of purchase.,
Look for bubble nests.When males are ready to mate, they typically create bubbles on the surface of the water.,
Check your Betta's gills for a beard.Both male and female Betta fish have a membrane under their gills that is a different color than their body.",How to Determine the Sex of a Betta Fish2," How you purchased your Betta can tell you a little about his or her sex. Male bettas are typically sold exclusively in the typical ""pet store"" because of their bright colors and large fins. These are typically male traits, and, consequently, most pet stores sell and stock only male Bettas. Female Bettas are typically sold by aquarium enthusiasts or higher-end aquarium stores.


Many pet store staffers are more knowledgeable about pets than you. However, their expert knowledge may be limited by their own pet interests. When consulting a pet store staff worker about the sex of a Betta, consider asking if they have ever personally bred Bettas, or if they have to look at the label before telling you if a Betta is male or female. When in doubt, assume the fish is male.

, They create hundreds or thousands of little tiny bubbles that group together. This is in preparation for tending to fertilized eggs. Male Bettas typically tend to be the primary caregivers for their offspring.

, Usually the beard is brown or black in coloration. Males tend to have larger beards than females. You may only be able to see the female's beard with when her gills are closed if you look hard enough. Males tend to be more obvious even when the gills are open.

Pick the right size tank.,
Keep the temperature between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Install a filter.,
Clean the tank each week.,
Choose a high quality food.,
Supplement your fish's diet with high fiber vegetables.,
Refrain from overfeeding.,
Establish a feeding schedule.,
Avoid overcrowding.,
Consider a separator if the fish become territorial.,
Watch for uneaten food at the bottom of the tank.,
Keep the tank temperature stable.,
Watch for signs of illness.",How to Care for a Fantail Goldfish," It's very important your fantail goldfish has a big enough tank. You should get a tank over a bowl, as bowls get dirty too fast. This can cause sickness and even death. Make sure you get a large tank at your local pet shop. Keep in mind that although keeping goldfish are quite easy, it takes quite some money to provide the right conditions for them.You will need at least 10 to 20 gallons per fish. Bigger is usually better, if you have the space and money. Fish with bigger tanks will be happier and live longer. Opt for the largest tank you can afford and fit in your home.;
, Fantail goldfish are fairly hardy, so if the water falls a little out of this range, they will usually be okay. However, strive to keep the water between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This is the best temperature rate for the health of your fish.You can use a thermometer to monitor water temperature. Room temperature should usually be in the 70 to 80 degree range, but may be warmer or colder depending on your region.
In general, the temperature may get a little warmer or colder than ideal, but most fantail goldfish can survive this. Just make sure not to let the water get under 60 degrees or into the triple digits.
However, if you live in a region where temperatures drop overnight, a heater is a good idea. If room temperature can get into the low 60's and even 50's, buy a heater at your local pet store and install it in your tank. Set the heater somewhere between 70 and 80 degrees., A filtration system is an important aspect of any fish tank, including a tank for your fantails. Buy a filter from your local pet shop designed to be used in a goldfish tank. Avoid filters that cause a lot of current in your tank, as this is bad for your goldfish. Goldfish do not do well in tanks with heavy currents., Once a week, remove and replace 10%-15% of the water in the tank. There is no need to remove your fish during a 10 to 15% water change. When you clean the tank, simply scoop out about 10 to 15% of the water and replace it with dechlorinated tap water.In addition to replacing the water, do some basic cleaning. Scrape any algae growing at the bottom of the tank. You can get an algae scraper at a local pet store to do this.
When replacing water in the tank, make sure the water is close to the tank's temperature. The easiest way to add new water is to place dechlorinated tap water in a bucket, and gradually siphon the new water from the bucket to the tank. You can use tubing, which you can purchase at a pet store or online, to siphon the water.
To dechlorinate water, you will need to purchase chemical neutralizers online or at your pet store. You will have to refer to your dechlorinator's label for specific instructions, but for the most part you'll add a drop or two of the dechlorinator to a gallon of water. Most dechlorinators work in a minute or two.

, You can find food for your fantails at a local pet shop. Pellets or flakes are usually the staple of a goldfish's diet, and should contain the nutrients your pet needs to thrive.In general, pellets may be better than flakes for goldfish. Flakes tend to crumble in the water, making them difficult to eat. Pellets may be more expensive, but they also may be better for your goldfish's overall health.
Check the labels when choosing a fish food. Make sure the food contains both protein and fat. In general, the higher percentages of protein and fat, the better.

, Goldfish are omnivores, meaning they need both meat and vegetables. In addition to feeding your fantails a high quality fish food, give them high fiber veggies. This will help with their overall health.Get some tender aquarium plants for your fish tank. Place these plants in your tank so your goldfish can snack on plants from time to time.
Elodea works well as a snack for goldfish. While goldfish will eat things like pellets and flakes quickly, they will take longer to consume vegetables. This is normal. Do not worry if a plant is not completely eaten for a week or so.

, As goldfish eat fast, people often accidentally overfeed them. It should not take your goldfish longer than 2 minutes to eat a serving of pellets or flakes. If your goldfish takes longer than this to finish its food, you're overfeeding it.You can refer to the pellet or flake package to get a sense of how much food your goldfish needs each day. Adjust the levels as necessary, depending on your fish's appetite.
If there is food leftover after two minutes have passed, reduce the amount you're feeding your fish. Goldfish may beg for food after being fed, but they generally get by on small servings.
Having plants in the tank can help the goldfish manage hunger between feedings.

, Feed your goldfish around the same time each day. This will help you remember to feed your fish every day. When feeding your fish, remember that they only need a small amount of pellets or flakes. If the goldfish is still looking for food after finishing its pellets, you can add some plants to the tank. Do not overfeed the fish pellets or flakes., Remember, you need 10 to 20 gallons of water per fish. If you add a new fantail goldfish to your tank, you will need to increase the tank size accordingly. If your fish feel overcrowded, they may become aggressive and fight with one another., Even in a properly sized tank, some goldfish are simply more territorial than others. If one fish seems to be consistently chasing another, invest in a tank separator to manage conflict.You can buy a tank divider at a pet store. Install it in your tank so your fish cannot get to one another.
You can also buy a new tank altogether to correct this problem.

, Uneaten food at the bottom of the tank can be a problem. Not only does this indicate you're overfeeding your fish, this could cause tank contamination. If you notice un-eaten food during a routine water change, remove it from the bottom of the tank. In the future, cut back on how much you're feeding your fish., Fantail fish can survive in a variety of temperatures. However, sharp increases or decreases in tank temperature can shock your fish's system. Take steps to assure the tank temperature remains relatively stable.Do not place a goldfish tank near a window. The air from outside can cause the tank temperature to rise or drop quickly.
Keep the tank in an area of your home where the temperature is stable. Watch for areas of the home prone to drafts, or that get warmer or colder during certain times of the day.

, You should also quarantine any fish that appear unhealthy. This not only prevents the spread of disease, but allows you to closely monitor the sick fish and treat the illness without harming the other fish, plants, and invertebrates in your tank with medicines and chemicals. Signs of illness can include:Bloated body
Listlessness
White spots on the body
Rapid breathing
Bulging eyes

This can help guide you to get the right tank mates for your gold fish.Ask yourself some of the following questions when considering buying tank mates for your goldfish:


How many fish do I want?
Can my tank house this many fish?
Can I afford to properly care for so many fish?
How much time will I need to devote to my fish?
What types of fish do I want?
Are the types of fish I want compatible with goldfish?;
, You might think your goldfish wants a mate, but they are actually perfectly happy to be on their own. You may also simply want to enjoy the beauty of multiple fish. Thinking about goldfish behavior can better inform you on what types of tank mates to buy.Remember that goldfish make a lot of waste and require at a 55-gallon tank for two fish. As you add more fish, you’ll need more space to maintain the health and wellbeing of your fish.
Be aware that goldfish require a steady water temperature of 65 to 75 degrees. Tank mates should have the same temperature requirements.Consider that goldfish need plenty of space to swim in order to maintain their health. Other types of bigger fish may crowd your goldfish and cause aggression.
Be aware that goldfish will nibble at or eat fish smaller than 2 inches in length. Larger fish may nibble at goldfish and cause them stress which can lead to fights between fish., Although it can be tricky to figure out what tank mates to buy, there are many different options for your goldfish. Consider adding the following to your tank with goldfish:


Hillstream loach
Weather or Dojo loaches
Corys
White cloud minnowsRosy red or fathead minnows
Zebra danios
Apple snails
Goldfish of similar breedsRubbernose and bristlenose plecos
Rosy barbsGhost shrimp
Red cherry shrimp, Just as there are great tank mates for goldfish, there are also some that may cause problems. This includes fish smaller than goldfish and other species of goldfish.House goldfish of similar species together. Don’t keep narrow-bodied and fat-bodied goldfish, sometimes called “fancy goldfish,” in the same tank. The narrow-bodied goldfish will eat all of the food before their fat-bodied or fancy fellows. This can harm the fat-bodied or fancy goldfish.
Remember that potential tank mates should also require water temperatures between 65 and 75. Likewise, fish sensitive to ammonia and other types of waste are also probably not compatible with goldfish, which produce a lot of waste. Look to find fish that can thrive in a pH balance of 7.0 to 8.0, which is also optimal for goldfish., There are a large variety of places that you can buy fish. From big box stores to specialty fish breeders, visit different retailers and compare what they offer. This can help you buy the best quality tank mates for your goldfish.Find out if the store has captive-bred or wild fish. In general, captive-bred fish are hardier than their wild counterparts. Be aware that captive-bred fish may cost more, but have a higher survival rate. This means you won’t have to spend as much replacing dead fish.
Examine how well maintained the store and potential tank mates are. You want to ensure that the fish are healthy and if they’re in the back of a filthy store, that could indicate that the fish were not well taken care of or maintained and may. This may lead to lower life span.
Ask the retailer about refund or return policies. If fishes die within a certain time after you’ve purchased them, some retailers may refund your money or give you a replacement fish.
Consult online reviews of potential retailers to spot any potential problems with them.

, Before you buy a tank mate and introduce it to your goldfish, it’s important to make sure the fish is healthy. This can prevent the introduction of illness and even death to your goldfish.Look for obvious signs of disease by examining the fish’s body and watching its behavior. Signs of physical disease include: white spots or velvety patches on the body, missing scales, incomplete fins, cloudy or bulging eyes, ulcers or other lesions, rapid breathing and shaking. Behavioral signs of disease may include: scraping against the tank, erratic swimming, listlessness, gasping at the surface, or sulking in a corner.
Make sure you check the other fish in the tank as well. Even if your potential tank mate doesn’t show obvious signs of disease, other diseased fish in the tank could indicate a potential problem. In these cases, even a healthy-looking potential tank mate could introduce disease to your goldfish.

, A fish that refuses to eat is a clear sign of illness or stress. This can be a potential problem if placed in a tank with your goldfish. Don’t be bashful in asking the retailer to feed the fish in front of you. If the retailer refuses, consider buying at another place.Be aware that eating in front of you is not a guarantee that you will not have problems with the tank mate down the road.

, Once you’ve had a chance to consider all of the variables of giving your goldfish tank mates and assessed their health, select a few options that you’d like to buy. Consider trying one or two different types to add to the tank to see how your goldfish reacts.


Ask your retailer any final questions you have about putting your selections with goldfish. Discuss any feeding and maintenance requirements and ask any questions you may have about this.

, There is no rush when introducing new tank mates. The longer you take to introduce new tank mates to your goldfish, the more likely you are to avoid disease, rejection, or other problems., Any time you buy a new tank mate for your goldfish, you will need to quarantine the fish from each other for a couple of weeks. This will help the tank mates get used to new water and ensure that no diseases are transmitted to your goldfish.Provide the new tank mates a separate quarantine tank. Use the same water in which your new fish came to keep it comfortable. Make sure the quarantine tank has plenty of hiding spaces and keep the water quality clean. This will help maintain the wellbeing of the new fish during this stressful time.Watch to make sure the new fish isn’t exhibiting any signs of disease or stress. If this happens, consider taking it back to your retailer for a new fish.

, Just as the new tank mates need to get used to their new surroundings, your goldfish will also need to get ready for a new tank mate. Taking steps to distract your goldfish and prevent aggression can prevent potential problems between the fish.Rearrange any decorations in the tank. This can distract the goldfish and remove any established territories. This can help the fish get along better because they will be on equal footing.
Feed your goldfish before acclimating the new tank mates and setting them free. This can help reduce any aggression your goldfish may feel towards its new tank mates.

, Once you’ve ensured that your new fish is healthy and ready for its new tank, you’ll need to acclimate it to the new tank water. This can help ensure a smooth transition for your new fish and the goldfish or any other fish you have in the tank.Float a sealed bag in your tank. Allow it to sit for 15 minutes before opening it so that the temperature in the bag adjusts gradually. Then cut open the bag and allow your new fish to swim free.

, For the first couple of weeks, make sure to watch how your new tank mates and goldfish are doing. Check to see if you can detect any diseases or behavior issues between the fish. If there is a problem, consult your retailer to see how to deal with them or consider returning the new tank mates if you can for an alternative.


Watch for symptoms of of physical disease such as parasites, white spots or velvety patches on the body, missing scales, incomplete fins, cloudy or bulging eyes, ulcers or other lesions, rapid breathing and shaking.
Look for behavioral signs of stress or disease such scraping against the tank, erratic swimming, listlessness, gasping at the surface, or sulking in a corner."

Do your research about all different kinds of goldfish. Common goldfish, comet goldfish, and other single tail goldfish need ponds or huge tanks as they can grow up to a foot or more in length. Do not get single tails unless you have a 180 US gallon (681.4 liter) tank laying around or a pond into which you can transition them when they get too large.


For decades goldfish were touted as being able to live in small bowls, and thus why they have a reputation of having short life spans. However, goldfish can actually live as long as a dog! Without enough filtration, ammonia builds up quickly in such a small space and the environment becomes toxic.
Goldfish will grow to match the amount of space available. However, you are not required to grow them to their full potential. Your one-inch goldfish can potentially grow to the size of your arm--but would only likely to do that if you own a large pond or professional aquarium.;
, It takes some time and care to set up a proper goldfish habitat. As mentioned below, there are quite a few steps to make sure the water and overall living conditions are good for the fish.









Fish are sensitive creatures that get stressed from going from one environment to another. Too much change too quickly can actually kill the fish even if the environment is ideal. Do not keep transferring your fish from one container to another.
Goldfish cannot live in small temporary environments (such as a plastic bag or small bowl) for very long. An hour is fine, several hours not very good, a day or so maximum for a small water container.
In an emergency, a large plastic bucket, rinsed well and with water treated with water conditioner works well.

, Goldfish are particularly prone to getting aquarium gravel caught in their mouths. Use either large gravel (too big to swallow) or very small gravel. Large gravel is better for goldfish because it will not get caught in their throat and because goldfish like to be able to dig into the gravel to search for fallen food.


Be sure to clean your gravel before you put it into the tank. Many aquarium gravels require rinsing, or your aquarium will be cloudy or dirty. Even if you have just bought it, a good rinse and soak in some water for a day will draw out some of the impurities and help ensure that your goldfish are getting the best environment to flourish in. Make sure to not use soap.

, Goldfish are diurnal which means they are active during the day. They need light to maintain a healthy wake/sleep cycle. There is also evidence that light is necessary to keep your fish's colors bright.Fish that can't sleep well or aren't getting enough sunlight are going to lose their color and become dull. Keep your aquarium lit for around 8-12 hours each day to replicate a healthy day/night cycle if it does not receive natural sunlight. Never put your tank in direct sunlight, either, as this could cause large temperature fluctuations and contribute to rampant algae growth.









Think about putting a rock or wood centerpiece with some artificial greenery into your aquarium. The rock or wood will give the goldfish nooks and crannies to explore and the artificial plants won't accelerate plant growth in your tank. Goldfish thrive with minimal decoration. They are typically chubby and poor swimmers, so having fewer obstacles means they can swim more freely. Consider having one medium to large statement piece in the center of the tank and a few plastic plants located outside of the swimming pattern to give your fish the most usable space.
Real plants are beneficial because they help absorb some of the ammonia, nitrites and nitrates that accumulates in the aquarium because of waste and natural wear and tear. However, goldfish are omnivores and voracious eaters. Stick with artificial plants until you have the time and resources to keep real plants safe from hungry goldfish.
Be sure that any decorations you choose aren't hollow (it's a breeding ground for potentially harmful bacteria) and that they don't have sharp edges (your fish might tear its fins).
Try using fluorescent lights for your goldfish. Halogen lights and incandescent lights will also do. Pay attention to how much light you give them — goldfish will appreciate 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness.

, Goldfish need a filter. A water filter should have 3 stages: Mechanical, for removing large particles such as fish waste or excess food; chemical, for removing odors, discolorations, and other organics; and biological, to break down fish waste and ammonia with beneficial bacteria. It should also be rated for the size of your tank. If your tank is on the borderline between two sized filters, it is usually better to go with the larger filter. Having clean water and a functional, efficient filtration device will keep your goldfish content and healthy. There are three very popular kinds of filters:









Hang on back (HOB) filters, which hang on the rim of your tank, and bring water in and filter water out. They are very popular, reasonably priced, and probably give you the most bang for your buck.
Canister filters sit underneath your aquarium and use a series of tubes to filter water in and out. Canister filters tend to be almost silent, are a little pricier than HOB filters, but tend to be more efficient at filtering than HOBs. Canister Filters are also typically made for tanks in excess of 50gal (About 189 Liters), and so are usually not available for smaller tanks.
Wet/Dry filters use an overflow box to filter out impurities. Wet/Dry filters, however, are significantly bigger than HOBs or canisters, and so generally only fit into aquariums that hold at least 50 gallons (189.2 liters).

, When you get your tank, fill it with tap water that has been treated with an appropriate water conditioning solution. Or, you could use distilled water.









Untreated tap water or drinking water has chemicals and minerals that could harm the fish.

, A fish-less cycle involves adding ammonia to a tank and keeping track of the nitrate levels to make sure the water is safe for your goldfish to live in. Sadly, many fish die once introduced into a new tank because of ammonia and nitrate poisoning. Make sure that you add dechlorinator, because the chlorine in tap water will kill your fish.


Before you add your fish, you'll need to make sure the environment is fish-ready. Pick up a pH test kit and test the tank for the right amount of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels. You want zero ammonia, zero nitrite, and less than 20 nitrate as your end result. Test strips can be difficult to use correctly, and tend to be more expensive, so get a liquid test kit like the API Master Test Kit.
What's going to happen is you'll start adding drops of ammonia continuously. That'll start the nitrite process going. If you keep doing what you're doing, eventually you'll see nitrates which are consumed by algae or plants. When you've done a lap, it's fish time!

, Hopefully, if you have more than one goldfish, your goldfish are all the same type. Unfortunately, goldfish are known to eat other, smaller fish, and can overeat, keeping food from their peers. If another fish is smaller or slower, it doesn't stand a chance. You can use a commercially available tank divider to keep your “bully” or weaker fish apart from the other(s).


Goldfish can be decent ""community tank"" fish. However, good roommates need to be selected carefully. White Cloud Mountain Minnows or Zebra Danios are good choices, and so are Plecos. However: These fish live in schools, so if you're buying extra fish, you need to at least buy an extra half dozen. So in short: Keep your goldfish with other similar goldfish.

Any new fish brought into an established aquarium should be quarantined for two weeks beforehand. If they have any diseases, you don't want those spread to your healthy fish!
Keep in mind that goldfish like colder water than most community fish, so any other species you add to the tank should be hearty. (You could also consider adding a goldfish to a tank with overly-productive livebearers to eat the unwanted offspring and keep your fish numbers in check.)



, even if it doesn't look dirty. Goldfish produce waste that even your water filter may not be entirely able to remove. A clean tank means happy, healthy goldfish. And a happy, healthy goldfish can live for decades!Soap is poisonous to fish and will kill them quickly, so don't wash your tank with soap. Also, don't use regular tap water to put in your tank. Drinkable water is not good for them because it takes out some of the minerals which are good for goldfish. Buy a water conditioner at a pet store and put in the amount it says on the label.









Avoid removing the fish from the tank when you clean. Using a gravel vacuum to soak up debris can be done without extracting the fish from their habitat. If you have to remove the fish, for whatever reason, use a plastic container instead of a net, if possible. Nets can injure goldfish fins more easily than containers can. They are also scared of nets and can cause them stress.Perform a 25% water change weekly assuming you have stocked your tank properly. Do a 50% water change whenever the nitrates reach 20. It can help to have a few old towels around for this messy process. Just be careful not to vacuum up any teeny fish while you're changing the water.

, Remember that test you did before you added your precious little fish? You gotta keep that up! Ammonia and nitrite levels should be at 0. A range of pH 6.5-8.25 is fine.

, Be careful not to overfeed them, only feed them what they can eat in a minute, the label on the food is wrong. Goldfish can easily overeat and can die. Underfeeding is always preferable to overfeeding. If you use floating food, soak it in water for a few seconds before feeding so that it will sink. This reduces the amount of air the fish swallows while eating, which in turn reduces the risk of buoyancy problems.









Just like humans, goldfish want diversity of nutrition. Feed your goldfish pellet food most of the time, live foods, such as brine shrimp, some of the time, and freeze-dried foods, such as mosquito larvae or blood worms, every once in a while. Remember to soak freeze dried food in a cup of aquarium water before you feed to your goldfish, freeze dried foods expand in a goldfish's stomach, causing to have problems swimming.
Feed your fish only what they can eat in one minute. Remove any excess food. More goldfish die from overeating than from anything else.
Feed your goldfish at the same time each day (once in the morning, once at night) and in the same spot in the tank.

, They don't have eyelids and they don't really stop swimming, but their bodies sort of hibernate. You can tell when you notice a slight change in color and reduced activity (they'll stick to one side of the tank).









Goldfish like to ""sleep"" in the dark. You really only need an aquarium light if you're growing plants or if the room is particularly poorly-lit. But even if you don't have an aquarium light, it's good environmental practice to reduce unnecessary energy use by turning off the light.

, Goldfish don't like temperatures over 75°F (24°C), but they appear to like seasonal changes where the temperature dips to the high 50s or 60s (15-20°C) in the winter. Understand that goldfish will not eat below 50-55°F (10-14°C).









A good thermometer makes this pretty easy. There are two types to choose from: those that hang inside and those that hang outside. Both should be accurate enough, but I like the ones that hang on the inside better.
If you're not breeding your goldfish, a steady temperature all year-round of 74°F (23°C) is golden. If you are breeding your goldfish, simulate the seasons (goldfish spawn in the spring). Start off by lowering the temperature (""Hey, guys, must be winter!"") to somewhere between 50°F (10°C) and 54°F (12°C). Then, when it's baby-making time, up it to between 68°F (20°C) and 74°F (23°C) gradually. The goldfish will be cued to then lay their eggs.

, If you notice your goldfish are congregating to the surface, odds are there isn't enough in the water. But good news! Oxygen levels will raise with a temperature reduction. So lower the temperature or get your aquarium out of the sun -- hopefully, crisis averted. or you can get a bubbler and an air pump to move the water.


If you've read all of this page, you're aware of the most common problems -- so you can avoid them! As long as you maintain appropriate pH, ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, and oxygen levels, don't overfeed your fish, and clean the tank, you've answered 95% of your pets' possible problems. Good for you!

, Sometimes even when we put forth our best efforts, things still go a bit awry. Water can turn yellow, green, or even white. If you notice it straight away, it's not a big deal. But do get to cleaning your tank!









Each color of the spectrum signifies a different problem. It could be algae, bacteria, or even just decaying plant matter. Don't get too alarmed! With another cycle and a water change, your fish should be fine.

, One of the most common goldfish diseases is Ich -- where the fish get little white spots on their bodies and fins and have difficulty breathing. It's a parasite that's curable. Move your fish to a hospital tank and use a commercially available fungicide.









The important thing to do here is to isolate your fish from other living things, including plants. The parasite can spread to any plant or animal that's living.
If you notice white spots on your gravel or scenery, remove the chemical stage of your filter and treat the whole tank. Keep the sick fish separated, as it will likely need more medical care than your healthy fish.
You can also attempt non-chemical alternatives such as increasing the water temperature or adding high levels of aquarium salt. Temperatures of 85F (29C) will kill most strands of ich, as will about a tablespoon of salt per gallon.Make sure to increase the temperature or add salt slowly over time, no more than 1-2 degrees F per hour or 1 tsp/gal per 12 hours, and continue treatment for at least 3 days after all signs of infection disappear. Once completed, perform frequent partial water changes to remove salt or reduce temperature. Be prepared for a loss of color or vibrancy in your treated fish.

, Another parasite that's a common culprit is Flukes. If infected, your fish will scratch against surfaces, develop an outer mucus, redden slightly, and possibly get a swollen belly.









As with any fish parasite (just like with Ich), quarantine your fish. He can be back swimming with his finned friends in a few days if you tackle it head on from the beginning.

, This one's pretty easy to identify, as your fish will be swimming sideways or even upside-down. You'd think he was up in fishy heaven, but no such luck. But there is luck in that it's not contagious and it can be readily fixed.









For this one, you may not need to quarantine your fish. Swimbladder disease is not a parasite. However, if you'd like to err on the side of caution, do so.
Medication is usually not needed to cure swimbladder diseases as over- or improper feeding are typically the cause. Reduce the amount you’re feeding your fish, or better yet, put them on a fast for about 3 days. This gives your fish’s gut bacteria time to return to normal. If symptoms persist, consider changing their diet to include more high-fiber foods like peas or cucumbers, or using a medicated fish food specifically to treat internal infections.

, First things first, dispose of your fish in a way that won't stink up the house. You can bury it, or, if you feel so inclined, throw it in the compost heap. Do not flush the fish down the toilet! Grab it from the tank with a plastic bag around your hands, invert the bag, and tie it up. How you clean your aquarium depends on your situation.


If only one fish died, hopefully it was a parasite that you saw quickly enough so as to avoid it spreading to the other creatures in the tank.
If all your fish are dying or dead, you'll need to clean out your aquarium entirely with a bleach solution. Just 1/4 of a teaspoon (a dash) for every gallon (3.8 liters) of water should do the trick. Let it soak for an hour or two to get rid of all the toxins. Then, remove the water and let it dry out.

Get the largest possible tank.,
Set up the tank prior to the purchase of a goldfish.,
Provide mental and physical stimulation for the fish.,
Add some equipment to increase oxygen diffusion into the water.,
Clean the tank at least once every two weeks, but more frequently is preferable due to the large amount of waste goldfish produce.,
Allow the water temperature to change as the seasons change.,
Feed the goldfish one to two times daily with food specifically designed for goldfish.",How to Make a Goldfish Live for Decades," Do not use a fish bowl; At least 75 liters (20 gallons) is necessary to make quality life for a single fish. Choose a tank with large surface area to increase the amount of oxygen in contact with the surface of the water (wider is better than taller).;
,


Getting it ready may take four or more weeks. It is necessary to build up enough good bacteria to break down the fish' wastes. To do this, do a ""fish-less cycle"". Once completed, your goldfish aquarium will have more than enough bacteria to break down fish waste. Failure to cycle a tank will result in ammonia poisoning and death.

, Decorate the tank with rocks, driftwood, hardy live plants, etc. Be sure that any decorations you choose aren't hollow (harmful bacteria can grow inside) and that they don't have sharp edges (your fish might tear its fins). Provide your fish with different areas in the tank, such as an open area ideal for swimming and a hiding area.


You can also train your fish various ways. If you feed them at the same time every day, they will soon be waiting for you at that time and grow used to your presence. Soon, you can teach them to eat from your hand. You can also use a fishnet with the netting taken out as a 'hoop' and train your fish to swim through it.

, A small air pump and air stone can be sufficient. You can also have the current from a 'waterfall' type filter help agitate the water's surface.

, Consider buying a filter, because goldfish produce a lot of feces, which can lead to a buildup of ammonia and nitrites, which are potentially harmful to your fish. If you don't have a filter, clean the tank twice a week. This is essential. How often you do this will depend on the size of your tank, the number of fish, and the effectiveness of the filter. Real plants are great as they will help absorb some of the ammonia, nitrites and nitrates.


Frequently test for ammonia and nitrite (you want both to measure zero). A pH test is also handy to ensure your goldfish's water is not too alkaline or acidic. This can be purchased at any pet store. Do not modify the fish's water, however, unless it is significantly different from neutral. Goldfish can tolerate a wide pH range, and pH modifying chemicals are not a lasting solution without more consistent monitoring than most people will do. A range of pH 6.5-8.25 is fine. Many municipal water supplies buffer their water up to around 7.5, and goldfish will live very happily in this range.
Do not remove the goldfish during a water change. Using a gravel vacuum to suck debris out of the gravel can be done with the fish in the tank. Frequent partial water changes are much better than full (and stressful) water changes.
If you do need to catch your fish, consider using a plastic container rather than a net, as the fish can injure its fins and scales while thrashing around. This also increases stress! If a net is the only option, soak it prior to use. Dry nets are much more likely to cause injury than wet ones. When using a plastic container, be careful and let the goldfish go in by itself, or it could be hurt.

, While goldfish don't like temperatures over 75°F (24°C), they do seem to like seasonal variations where the temperature falls to the high 50s or 60s (15-20°c) in the winter. Fancier goldfish are an exception and cannot easily tolerate temperatures below about 60°F (16°c). Be aware that goldfish will not eat below 50-55°F (10-14°c).

, If you choose to feed them more often, then reduce the size of the meals so you don't overfeed. Give them only as much as they can eat in a few minutes, and clean any leftovers immediately. If a floating food is used, soak it in water for a few seconds before feeding so that it will sink. This reduces the amount of air the fish swallows while eating, which in turn reduces the risk of buoyancy problems.

July and August are the best months to purchase your fish, as goldfish like to breed during the Spring.You'll want your goldfish to be properly adjusted to their habitat and de-stressed before breeding season, so try to plan far enough in advance!


The first thing you want to do (assuming you already have a smaller tank that can hold at least 4 gallons, or 15 liters) is to clean your newly purchased breeders. By adding 80 eye drops of Formaldehyde, 6 drops of Copper Sulphate and just 1 small measure of Terramycin, you will be able to clean the goldfish and the tank to keep all healthy.;
, The tank you plan to breed them in should hold at least 20 gallons (75.7 liters) of water. Additionally, add the necessary props for a natural-looking goldfish habitat. This normally includes natural or artificial bushy plants or fertile, sprawling fibers.


When females lay their eggs, they usually anchor them to something solid. If you're going to let them breed naturally, you'll definitely want a lush environment. If you're going to breed them artificially, no plants are necessary, although they do improve quality of life (and act as a great water filter) when the fish are not breeding.
Consider investing in spawning mops. Spawning mops are made of floating nylon string into which females send their eggs.You don't need spawning mops if you have plenty of brush, plants, or other fibrous material, but they're an easy, efficient way of safeguarding your goldfish eggs, as grown-up goldfish tend to eat any unsecured eggs.

, Without abruptly changing the diet of your goldfish, start introducing non-pellet food, such as brine shrimp or live black worms, into their tanks. This simulates the natural bounty of springtime, when goldfish like to breed. A couple of pointers on feeding your goldfish in general:


Feed your goldfish in small amounts but often. Feed them three times a day, being careful not to overfeed them. Many goldfish owners make the mistake of feeding their fish too much; the leftover scraps remain uneaten, sink to the bottom of the tank, decomposing and spoiling the water.
No matter what you feed them, make sure you crumple it up small enough to fit in their mouths.

, Goldfish breed in the Spring, so you want to replicate the heating up of the water. To do this, first drop the temperature to between 10°C (50°F) and 12°C (54°F). Then, when you're ready to breed, raise the temperature by 2°C (3°F) per day, until the temperature is between 20°C (68°F) and 23°C (74°F).

, A partial water change is important to the general wellbeing of your fish and in stimulating breeding conditions specifically. Remove as much as 20% of the water in your tank daily, being sure not to exceed this amount.


Remember to add water conditioner to the water that you cycle into the tank. Conditioners neutralize chemicals harmful to your fish, as well as remove chlorine and counteract chloramines., Sexing your goldfish is probably the single most important task in breeding; obviously, if you put a bunch of males together because you can't tell them apart, you're not going to end up with any progeny. Here's what females tend to look like:


Look at the shape of their vent. The vent is a small opening between the anus and the anal fin where fish excrete egg or sperm, depending on the sex.Female vents are rounded and convex, like an outie.
Feel the abdomen. The abdomen, between the pelvic and anal fins, is very soft and movable for females.
Look at the pectoral fins. The pectoral fins of females are round and short.
Overall, female goldfish tend to be a bit smaller and rounder than male goldfish, who tend to be longer and pointier. This, however, is a less reliable way to tell the two apart.

, Male goldfish tend to be a bit smaller than their female counterparts. They can also be distinguished by looking at the following traits:

The presence of small white stars, or tubercles. Tubercles are little bumps that appear on the fins, head, and even gills of males when they're ready to breed.
A concave, or innie, vent. Males have a vent that slices inward instead of bulges outward.
Feel the abdomen. The abdomens of males is much more rigid and hard than those of females.
Look at the pectoral fins. The pectoral fins of males are pointier and longer compared to the short, round pectoral fins of the females.

, During breeding season, males start chasing around females, sluggishly at first but with increasing fervor. Introduce a known female into the tank and look for the reaction of the other fish: Males will show a lot of interest, whereas females will show none!

, Many breeders separate males and females at least a few weeks before breeding in order to create a greater desire to breed. Just like with humans, absence makes the heart grow fonder!

, Young robust goldfish are ideal because of their high fertility and sex-drive. For a female goldfish, look for ones with large rear and pectoral areas; for males, find a large mate (approximately anywhere from 4 to 6 inches) that is also a fast swimmer. Males with many small tubercles behind their heads on their gills is a sign of an ideal mate.


For an ideal mix of breeders, try to isolate your three best male and two best female goldfish.

, You will notice that the male goldfish will bear a lighter tint around their stomach area and be swimming swiftly around the tank, typically chasing the females. The female will drop the eggs over one of the plants, once the male goldfish will distribute sperm over the eggs to fertilize them. If you miss the moment of procreation, but see eggs in the plants, they have likely been fertilized.

, Introduce one male and one female together in a shallow tank. Gently hold the male goldfish and lightly rub his vent, clearing it of sperm. Swirl the sperm in the water and repeat the same process with the vent of the female, releasing her eggs. Swirl the water again to combine the sperm and the eggs.


Be very ginger with artificial insemination. Your goldfish can bruise easily, so apply very light pressure when clearing their vents.
You don't have to keep your goldfish under water as you squeeze their vents. Goldfish, like other fish, can breathe outside of water, although not as well. Just be sure to keep them out of water for no more than 30 seconds at a time.

, Unfortunately, goldfish in captivity have a tendency to eat nearly all their eggs. This makes it necessary to separate the parents from their eggs almost immediately to ensure a full batch of eggs is hatched successfully. Fertilized eggs should hatch within 4 to 7 days, depending on the temperature of the water.


When the eggs finally do hatch soon after they are fertilized, you can feed them the same food that you feed the adults. Just make sure that they are in even smaller bites than the adult food so their smaller mouths and throats are capable of ingestion.
Try to keep the eggs in the same water they were bred in. Transplant only at your own risk.

, Soon you will have a whole litter of young goldfish swimming around your tank. Make sure the tank is big enough to accommodate all the young goldfish fry.

Look for common symptoms of swim bladder disorder.,
Know which fish are most likely to be affected.,
Understand what causes swim bladder disorder.,
Look for signs of infection.",How to Fix Swim Bladder Disease in Goldfish1," Swim bladder disorder occurs when a fish's swim bladder, which normally inflates and helps the fish stay properly afloat, becomes compromised. No matter what's causing the problem, the symptoms are usually the same. When you see your fish belly-up, don't assume it's dead; if it's still breathing, it probably has swim bladder disorder. Here are symptoms to look for:


The fish keeps floating to the top, upside-down
The fish keeps sinking to the bottom of the tank
The fish swims with its tail higher than its head (note: this is normal for head standing fish species)
The fish has a swollen belly;
, Goldfish, especially fancy goldfish, and betta fish are most commonly affected by swim bladder disorder. These types of fish have round, short bodies, which causes their organs to become compressed. The fish's internal organs can press against the swim bladder and make it difficult for it to function properly.


If you have a fancy goldfish or a betta fish, you'll need to monitor it carefully for signs of swim bladder disorder. Left untreated it can lead to death.
Natural goldfish varieties with longer bodies are less prone to getting swim bladder disorder, since their organs are not packed tightly together.

, When a fish's tiny organs become enlarged, they can press against the swim bladder and cause it to malfunction. The stomach, intestines and liver are especially prone to becoming enlarged due to the fish's eating habits. Any of the following can cause swim bladder disorder:


Gulping too much air while eating, causing the stomach to become enlarged
Eating low quality or air-filled food, causing constipation in the intestine
Eating too much, causing fatty deposits to enlarge the liver
The development of cysts in the kidney, causing it to become enlarged
Deformity of an internal organ

, Sometimes swim bladder disorder is a symptom of infection, and you won't be able to solve that by changing your fish's eating habits. If you believe that your fish has an infection, it's important to treat that separately to help your fish get healthy again.


If your fish has an infection, it will exhibit clamped fins, shaking, and lack of appetite in addition to other symptoms of swim bladder disorder.
Start by cleaning the tank to reduce bacteria levels; in many cases, this will kill the bacteria causing the infection.
If symptoms persist, consider treating the fish with a broad spectrum antibiotic to cure the infection. Antibiotics are available at your pet store in the form of water treatment drops or medicated fish food flakes. Be sure to follow the instructions so as not to over medicate your fish.

Get an aquarium.,
Find an appropriate spot for the tank.,
Fill the tank with water.,
Add hiding spots.,
Clean the tank weekly.,
Maintain high water quality.,
Check the filters.,
Feed your piranhas.,
Look for illness.,
Recognize normal piranha behavior.",How to Care for Piranhas," A proper habitat is key to caring for your piranha, so create a home as close to the fish’s natural habitat as possible. Many people suggest getting a tank large enough for 4 piranhas to best mimic the natural environment. However, you may want less. Get an aquarium of at least 25 gallons for one piranha or 60 gallons for four piranhas to properly house them.Buy a tank that corresponds with the number of piranhas you’ll have. For example, if only want two animals, a 40 gallon tank should be enough space for them. As a rule of thumb, you want about 20 gallons of water per animal or 60 gallons for 4 piranhas.Make sure to the biggest tank you can afford so that your piranhas can flourish. If you’re trying to save money, consider a second hand tank. Wash any tanks before introducing your piranhas to them.
Consider getting an optional tank screen for the top. Piranhas can jump and injure their owners if they’re hungry. You also want to ensure that pets or small children don’t fall in the tank.;
, Piranhas are messy animals that are also surprisingly timid.In addition, direct sunlight or heat can encourage the growth of bacteria that can harm your piranha. Placing the tank in a spot that is not exposed to extreme heat or lots of traffic can keep your piranha happy and healthy.Put the tank in a place with a relatively consistent temperature of 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 25 Celsius). Attach a thermometer to the aquarium to monitor the temperature. You shouldn’t put the tank anywhere it may get direct sunlight or be exposed to radiators or heating devices.
Find a low-traffic space in which to put the tank. If there are too many people walking by the tank, it can stress out piranhas and may make them aggressive.
Consider putting the tank in a space with low light. In the wild, piranhas live in murky water that is under the canopy of the rain forest so their eyes have adapted to dimmer lighting.

, Piranhas are surprisingly hearty fish and can adapt to different water conditions. In general, they live in warm, fresh water between 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. They also thrive at a pH of 5.5-8.0.You can fill the tank with warm tap water as long as you’re using several filters in the water. In addition, you should keep a temperature in the water to ensure it is optimal for your piranhas to thrive.


Add several small filters to the water or one very powerful external filter to keep the water clean.Consider getting a heater for the water to keep the water a consistent temperature., Because piranhas are shy, they like to hide. Putting some decorations in the tank can help keep your piranhas happy and healthy.Decorate the tank with live and plastic plants as well as smooth gravel, and pieces of wood. Be aware that Piranhas may destroy live plants. A clean piece of PVC piping can also provide piranhas a place to hide if they feel stressed.Choose decorations that you like. You can use live or plastic plants or a combination. If you’re using live plants, consider hardy, low-light options such as hornwort, java moss, or fern. Any type of plastic plant you like will work.
Soak any wood or driftwood in a tub or bin until it turns a brownish color. Many piranhas like the dark color of the water, but it may be difficult to see your fish. Make sure the driftwood fits in the tank and gives your piranhas plenty of space to swim freely.
Use smooth rocks and gravel that only barely cover the bottom of the aquarium. You can safely use granite, basalt, gneiss, slate, and quartz. Avoid limestone, marble, dolomite, calcareous sandstones, chalky rocks as well as corals and sea shells. All of these can upset the pH of the tank.
Place as many decorations as you like in the tank, but remember that your piranhas should be able to swim freely without hindrance. A good rule of thumb is 50-75% coverage in the tank to make your piranhas feel comfortable.Too many decorations can also more quickly decrease the water quality.

, Fresh and clean water is an absolute must to your piranha’s health. Replacing 10-20% of the water every week and cleaning tank walls and gravel can prevent a compromised immune system and also odor.Weekly maintenance shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes.Write a schedule for yourself to clean the water at the same time each week so that you don’t forget. Clean the aquarium more often if you notice excess waste—remember piranhas are messy—or odor.
Be aware that you shouldn’t remove your piranhas from the tank if at all possible. Remember that piranhas generally attack when they feel threatened or are hungry. Protect your hands with a pair of heavy gloves when cleaning. If you absolutely have to remove your piranha from the water, place a bucket or large fish net in the tank and quickly place your piranha in a separate tank.Use a water changing device, or python, from a local pet store for best results. These hook up to a sink and make it easy to clean the tank. This can also minimize the risk of your piranha becoming aggressive with you.If you don’t have a water changing device, gently remove each piranha and put them in a separate holding tank while you clean. This will allow you to clean the tank without stressing your fish or getting injured because the piranhas are stressed.
Vacuum the gravel and remove any waste while using the water changing device or when the tank water is low and no piranhas are in the tank.

, The health and lifespan of your piranha is dependent on high water quality. Ensure proper pH and oxygenation by testing the tank water after every cleaning.Test tank water with a test kit that you can get at large retailers and pet stores. Test to figure out potential problems like low oxygen, high ammonia, and acidity.Fix any problems with the water. The pH level can range from 5.5-8.0. Use a chemical neutralizer to restore the pH levels if they are off. Oxygen saturation should exceed 70%. If it doesn’t, you may need to replace your filter or filters.
Use a thermometer to make sure the temperature is between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If necessary, turn up the heater until you reach the optimal temperature range.

, Piranhas produce a lot of waste, which can also affect the water quality. Make sure you have a very strong filter or several small filters to stagger maintenance. If tank water gets dirty quickly, consider replacing your filters.Smell the water to see if it has a foul odor. This is a good sign you need to change the filters.

, Despite what many people think, piranhas are omnivores that eat everything, not just meat. Giving your piranhas a varied diet can increase their span and boost their immunity.Feed your piranhas one a day. Feeding them more often can lead to overfeeding and increases the amount of waste in the tank. Piranhas should eat everything given to them within two minutes or this can contribute to poor water quality and susceptible to disease. The only exception is vegetables, which can be left for a few hours.
Give your piranhas processed, frozen, and freeze dried foods including fish, crabs, prawns, rainworms and shed snakeskin. Occasionally feed them green vegetables such as raw zucchini, spinach, or potato. Avoid giving piranhas dry market feed, flakes or granules.Avoid feeding piranhas live animals. Not only can they introduce disease to your piranhas, but can contribute significantly to waste in the tank., Even though piranhas are hearty animals, they can get sick. Not maintaining the tank water and aggressive other fish can lead to illness and death. Piranhas should be active, alert, and have no body damage. Minor nipped fins are normal for a piranha. They should also eat readily and quickly. Watch each of your piranhas for any of the following signs of illness:


Lethargy or sluggishness
Unwillingness to eat
Severe body damage such as bites or chunks of missing flesh
Cloudy or missing eyes
Labored breathing
Visible parasites on the skin, Piranhas are very complex animals that can exhibit a variety of behaviors that may not appear normal to you. It’s important to watch your piranhas to help you understand their behavior for cleaning the tank as well as watching for potential illness. The following are normal piranha behaviors that you may recognize:Aiming towards gravel and tilting the tail, both of which are signs of aggression to keep someone from entering the piranhas space
Growing paler in appearance, which can be due to the colors not coming out yet or as a sign of stress
Turning on their sides and rubbing the gravel to itch themselves, which can indicate poor water quality, infection, or just needing to scratch
Holding their mouths open and wagging violently from side to side, which is a sign of the piranha being ready to fight
Chomping mouths repeatedly, which is a sign of hunger
Circling the tank repeatedly as a sign of displeasure with something in the tank or controlling the territory
Intensify colors, which are a sign of the piranha being very happy or angry
Turning black, which is a sign that a piranha is ready to breed
Getting side by side and wagging tails, which is a sign that piranhas are breeding or ready to fight
Biting each others’ fins as a warning to desist or be killed

Research other diseases.",How to Care for Neon Tetra," Neon tetras need at least an aquarium that will hold at least 10 gallons (38 L) of fresh water. This will provide enough space for hiding and swimming. Estimate about 10 gallons (38 L) for every 24 fish you want to keep., Do this a few weeks before bring your tetras home. This will clean the aquarium and remove any harmful bacteria that could kill your fish. Buy a water testing kit at the pet store. Make sure the water reads 0 parts per million (ppm) of ammonia (NH3), nitrite (NO2-), and nitrate (NO3-) before adding your fish.To cycle your tank, fill the tank with fresh water and run the filter. Add enough NH3 to raise its measurement to 2 ppm. Test the water daily and keep track of how long it takes for the NH3 to break down into NO2-. As NO2- levels rise, add more NH3 to bring them down. Eventually, the process will encourage the growth of NO3-forming bacteria. This will cause the NO2- level to fall. Continue to test the water until all three compounds fall to 0 ppm., Neon tetras are small, delicate fish whose bodies can get sucked into a filter with deadly results. Use mesh or foam to cover the intake. This will protect your fish while allowing the filter to regulate the bacteria in the water., In the wild, neon tetras are used to waters rich in plant life. Install aquatic or semi-aquatic plants from the pet store. Leaf litter and driftwood will also replicate tetras' natural habitats.Plants and driftwood also provide tetras with the hiding places they enjoy in the wild., Tetras thrive in mildly acidic water, with a pH of about 5.5 to 6.8. Buy pH testing strips in your local pet supply store. Follow the instructions on the label to properly read the test results. Test the pH each time you change the water.If you want to breed your tetras, keep the pH slightly lower, between 5.0 and 6.0., Buy nylon pantyhose and a bag of organic peat (also known as sphagnum moss) from your local big box store. After washing your hands, stuff the peat into the foot of the panty hose. Tie off the hose after it's stuffed and cut off the foot. Lower the bag into the water and squeeze it to release some peat-filtered water. Then, drop it in the tank. Replace it every few months.Peat bags will also help to soften the water, which tetras require for survival., In the wild, tetras live in dark waters. Keep the aquarium in a relatively dark corner of the house. Buy low-wattage bulbs in your pet supply store to create a dim effect. The plants and other hiding places will also help to shade the inside of the aquarium., Generally, your tank should stay around 70–80 °F (21–27 °C). Purchase an adjustable aquarium heater that you can find in most pet supply stores. To monitor the temperature, buy an aquarium thermometer.For breeding, maintain the temperature at about 75 °F (24 °C)., Neon tetras need clean water low in nitrates and phosphates to resist diseases. Replace 25-50 percent of the water in the tank at least every other week. Scrub out any algae growing on the tank, filter, or décor., Neon tetras need to be in groups of six or more. Otherwise they'll get stressed and become ill. Avoid adding larger carnivorous fish whose diets might include tetras. Some acceptable tankmates include other tetras, algae-eating fish like otos and cories, and African dwarf frogs., You'll have to buy an additional tank, if you don't have one already. Keep them in the quarantine tank for at least two weeks. This will prevent contagious diseases like Neon Tetra Disease and Ich., Neon tetras are omnivorous fish that live primarily on insects in the wild. Feed them wingless fruit flies and live or freeze-dried bloodworms. You should also supply them with algae (live or in wafer form), live or freeze-dried brine shrimp, and fish pellets. Collect these foods in the wild or buy them in a pet supply store.


From time to time, tetras need frozen peas that have been thawed and shelled. This will aid in digestion.
Neon tetras may be scared to come up and eat, or they may not notice their food. If they aren't eating, use a dropper to put the food near them., This is the most common disease among neon tetras. The first sign is swimming away from tankmates. Affected tetras will also lose their neon stripe and develop spots or cysts on their dorsal fins. As soon as you recognize early symptoms, relocate the sick fish to a quarantine tank immediately. The disease is almost always incurable, but it never hurts to ask the vet for advice.It's normal for neon tetras to become dull in color at night. This is the result of special skin cells called chromatophores taking a rest. However, if the dullness continues during the day for several days in a row, the fish may be ill., Ich is a highly contagious parasite that takes the form of small white cilia-covered spots on the fish's body. To fight it, slowly raise the tank temperature to at least 86 °F (30 °C) for three days. This should kill the parasite.

If the spots don't disappear after three days, put your fish in a quarantine tank and add cupramine (copper solution) to the water. Follow the instructions on the label. Keep the copper levels at 0.2 ppm. You can measure copper levels with a salifert test kit that you can buy in hobby stores.Kill the Ich in the original tank with aquarium salts, which you can buy in pet supply stores. Add one teaspoon (5 g) per gallon (4 L) of water every 12 hours for 36 hours. Let the salt remain in the tank for 7 to 10 days.

If you have plastic plants, aquarium salts will melt them. For the sake of your tetras, toss the plants., Unhealthy neon tetras can also develop skin flukes, bacterial infections and diseases, and parasitic infections. Talk to your vet or read books that detail the symptoms and treatments of all diseases your fish might develop. In many cases, catching the early symptoms and taking immediate action can save your fish."
"
Raise the water temperature in the tank.,
Let the fish fast for three days.,
Prepare cooked peas for the fish.,
Feed the fish by hand if necessary.,
Monitor the fish's symptoms.",How to Fix Swim Bladder Disease in Goldfish2," A cold water temperature can slow digestion and lead to constipation. While you're treating your goldfish's swim bladder disorder, keep the water temperature between 70 and 80 degrees F to help aid in faster digestion.

, Since swim bladder disorder is commonly caused by eating problems, start by letting your fish fast for three days. When fish overeat they can end up with enlarged internal organs, causing the swim bladder to be compromised. Give the fish a chance to digest the food that it has already eaten and allow its stomach, intestines and other organs to shrink back to normal size.Fasting for three days should not negatively affect your fish. However, do not continue the fast for more than three days.
During the fast, observe your fish to see whether the swim bladder disorder seems to have gone away. If the fish is still exhibiting symptoms, move on to the next step.

, Peas are high in fiber as well as being dense, so they help ease a fish's constipation problems. Buy a package of frozen peas and cook them until soft (either in the microwave or on the stove). Remove the peel from a pea and drop a bit of pea into the water to feed your fish. The fish should eat no more than a pea or two per day.Try not to overcook the peas; if they're too mushy, they'll fall apart before the fish can eat them.
When fish eat flake food, they often gulp too much air, causing indigestion and organ enlargement. Feeding them dense peas remedies this problem.

, When you drop a bit of pea into the water, it will be dense enough to sink to the bottom of the tank. Fish with swim bladder disorder may have trouble swimming to the bottom to reach the food. If necessary, hold the pea near the surface of the water until the fish is able to move close enough to eat it.


You can also skewer a pea on a toothpick and hold it within close range of the fish.
Lowering the water level so the fish can reach the peas is also effective.

, After a few days on a peas-only diet, the fish's digestion should begin to get back to normal, and you should see it begin swimming without problems again. At this point you can begin feeding the fish regular fish food again.


If symptoms persist, the fish may have an untreatable problem, such as an organ deformity or internal damage. Give it a few more days to see if the symptoms of swim bladder disorder go away. If your fish never regains the ability to swim and eat properly, euthanasia may be the most humane solution.

"
"
Soak food before feeding.,
Do not over feed.,
Keep the tank clean.,
Keep the water temperature appropriately warm.",How to Fix Swim Bladder Disease in Goldfish3," Flaky fish food floats at the top of the water, so when fish take a bite they also gulp down some air. This can cause their organs to become enlarged, leading to swim bladder disorder. Try soaking fish food before adding it to the tank so that it will sink into the water, allowing fish to eat it without taking in air.


You can also buy sinking fish food that automatically sinks to the bottom of the tank without needing to be soaked.
If you feed the fish anything besides flakes or pellets, make sure it's nutrient dense and fully thawed before feeding.

, When fish eat too much they can become constipated, leading to intestine or stomach enlargement and swim bladder problems. Fish should only be fed a small amount of food once per day. Even if your fish seems like it's always hungry, it only needs a small amount of food to function healthily.

, A dirty tank harbors bacteria and parasites, putting strain on a fish's symptom and sometimes leading to infection. Make sure to clean the tank frequently so that your fish is taking in clean water, rather than swimming around in waste.


Use a water test kit to check pH, ammonia, and nitrite levels. Changing the water doesn't guarantee proper levels, especially if you have never tested your water since starting your tank. Goldfish do best with a pH level of 7.2 - 7.6, as little ammonia as possible and a nitrate level of between 0 and .25 ppm.
Try adding aquarium salt made for freshwater tanks. Aquarium salt is good for helping to fight disease and boosts the goldfish's immune system.

, Check the temperature every so often to make sure it is about 70 degrees F. Goldfish don't function well in colder water; keeping them at a lower temperature can strain their systems and slow digestion.

Add other fish to your tank.,
Check the sex of your fish.,
Watch for your fish to spawn.,
Separate the eggs from the parents.,
Feed the new fish.",How to Care for Corydoras," Corydoras are not very large fish, and generally don’t need too much room. A 20-gallon tank should be plenty big enough for a small school of non-dwarf Corydoras (about 4 to 6 fish). Of course, if you consider adding more fish, whether Corydoras or something else, you’ll need a bigger tank.There is a traditional “rule of thumb” that suggests 1-gallon per inch of fish that you put in the tank. This can be a good starting point for thinking about tank capacity, but keep in mind this rule is more accurate when measuring the *volume* of a fish. A ten-inch long fish probably is about 50-150 inches in volume, requiring a much larger tank than 10 1-inch-long fish that total to about 8 inches in volume. It is always best to err on the side having more space for your fish.;
, Corydoras are hardy and adaptable fish, but they prefer certain conditions. Make sure your water’s pH level is around 7.0, and the temperature range between 70 and 78 degrees. Keep levels of nitrates and ammonia low, as these chemicals can cause sickness., Corydoras are bottom feeders, and like to swim and explore near the bottom of the tank. To protect your fish, use smooth gravel or sand, with a depth of at least 2 inches. Sharp or dirty bases can damage their barbels (the whiskers near the mouth that help the fish look for food) so stick to the fine grains.You don’t want to use small stones, as Corydoras like to dig around, and they need something they can lift up and root through.

, Corydoras are from areas with lots of vegetation and hiding spots, so it is important to have those in your tank. Bushy plants with lots of stems at the base are important, as well as bogwood or other decor that creates areas the Corydoras can hide from other fish., Corydoras are bottom-feeding catfish, so they will eat pellets and flakes that sink to the bottom of the tank. Make sure you watch your fish eat, and avoid overfeeding by not giving them more food than they can eat in five minutes. If there is extra food in the tank, remove it to keep your tank clean.Corydoras are omnivores, meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. For an occasional treat, you can include frozen and live foods that sink to the bottom to complement a more regular diet of flakes and pellets. Though they may scavenge on the bottom of your tank, that food will not be enough, so make sure you supplement it with a variety of supplements to give your fish the right nutrition.
Because Corydoras are nocturnal fish, the best time to feed them will probably be in the evening, before you turn out the lights for the night.

, Corydoras are social fish, and generally prefer to swim in schools. For Corydoras, a school is a group of five or more. There are over a hundred different species, and while they will tend to school together if possible, Corydoras are generally sociable with other Corydoras. If you have one, it would probably enjoy some company.Depending on the pet store, species may or may not be sold together. Talk to the pet store about making sure you are getting the same species, and use your own eyes to compare size and color to find fish that appear to be the same.

, Corydoras are unaggressive, non-territorial fish, making them perfect tank mates for a variety of other fish. One thing to consider would be to include surface and mid-level fish, which will help balance out your tank, and give people lots to look at.Good partners for your Corydoras include fish like the Otocinclus Catfish, Tetras, Swordtails, Guppies, Dwarf Cichlids, and other similar-sized fish. Filter-feeding shrimp and snails also make good company. Some of these smaller fish see Corydoras as “dither fish” (a sign that there are no predators ). This will reduce fear, and help to make their transition to a new tank easier.
Bad partners for your Corydoras include cichlids, roughens, aquarium crayfish, and fish that are larger than your Corydoras. These can injure, or even eat, your Corydoras.

, If you decide to breed your Corydoras to make more, you of course need to know that you have both males and females. The differences are easy to notice, and you can check them by looking at your fish from above. Females will be a little larger, with a rounder and broader body, while males tend to have slightly larger pectoral fins.If you intend to breed your Corydoras, you should try to get a ratio of two or three males for each female.

, If your fish are ready to spawn, you will notice the males chasing the females and mating in the T position. Once they have mated, the female will lay her eggs against the aquarium glass, or among the leaves of the plants in your tank.In the wild, Corydoras usually spawn during the rainy season, so you can encourage mating by simulating these conditions. If you begin to notice your Corydoras engaging in spawning behavior, perform a water change with slightly cooler water.

, Once you notice eggs in the tank, you should separate them from the parents. Corydoras will eat their own and each other’s eggs, so if you want new Corydoras, you should make sure the eggs and parents are in different tanks.One way to do this is to move the Corydoras to a separate breeding tank when you start to notice them spawning. Once the females lay eggs in the tank, you can move the fish back into their regular tank, and let the eggs hatch in peace.
You can also remove eggs to their own hatching and raising tank after they have been laid. Keep the water conditions as similar as possible. If the eggs were laid in the plants, you can simply transfer the plants. If you’d prefer not to remove the whole plant, it is fine to cut off the parts where the eggs are and just move that. If the eggs are on the side of the tank, remove them by rolling your finger over them. Eggs are tough, so you shouldn’t do any damage removing them this way.

, The eggs should hatch in three to five days. Once that happens, the new hatchlings, called “fry,” will be able to survive on their yolk sac until they start swimming freely. Once that happens, provide some brine shrimp nauplii (a type of larva) or decomposing plant material for them to eat. After about a week, you can start including microworms into their diet."

The substrate should be about 2-2.5 inches (50-65cm) in height, which is about 10 pounds (4.5kg) of substrate.This not only decorates the tank, but also provides surfaces on which you can hook hitching posts for the seahorses.Avoid putting too much substrate in your tank. This can cause food to fall into the substrate and create hydrogen sulfite, which is toxic to seahorses., Mix saltwater for your tank using fresh, clean, and dechlorinated tap water with a sea salt mix. Place your fresh water in a storage bucket and add water purifier to dechlorinate it. Wait two hours and add aquarium salts per the package instructions. Then pour into your tank., Add one large or several small filters to the water. Make sure the water will turn over the entire water volume 3-4 times per hour. This can ensure the health of your seahorses, which can produce a considerable amount of waste.Get a filter with a lower water flow. Seahorses can be sensitive to water flow because they are relatively weak swimmers., Choose a selection of real and faux items to decorate the tank. These can give your seahorse ideal places to rest and hide. Use any of the following to spruce up your tank and help keep your seahorse happy and healthy:Rock
Coral
Plants
GorgoniasMacro algae

, Give your seahorses a selection of frozen Mysid shrimp, small krill and brine shrimp twice each day. Place about 50 krill or shrimp per seahorse in the tank at each feeding. Siphon off anything the seahorse doesn’t eat. This can ensure your seahorse gets proper nutrition.It also ensure that old food doesn’t create toxic hydrogen sulfite.Ask if a local aquarium dealer has live diets available for seahorses. Give this to your seahorse occasionally to boost their nutrition.

, Consider keeping your seahorse tank only for your seahorse or other seahorses. Add other types of tank mates with care. Many other species are not ideal mates for seahorses because they may consume your seahorse’s food. Some may even make your seahorse the meal. The following tank mates may cohabitate best with your seahorse:Snails
Limpets
Goby
Blenny
Clownfish
Tangs

, Check in on the health and vitality of your seahorses every day. Look for signs of its health during feedings. This can alert you to potential issues so you can treat them quickly. The following traits are signs of a healthy seahorse:Active, moving around
Bright active eyes that swivel around searching for food
Clear fins
Full, round belly

, Just as it’s important to observe signs of health, it’s vital to notice any potential symptoms of disease. This can ensure you get prompt care and treatment for your seahorse. Symptoms of disease in seahorses includes:Cloudy eyes
Little eye movement
White, grey or inflamed growths
Heavy breathing, panting or coughing
Bloating

, Consult a vet if your seahorse has any signs of disease. They can diagnose the problem and provide proper treatment. This may include popping air bubbles, prescribing medication or giving the seahorse an antibiotic. Prompt veterinary care can ensure the health of your seahorse and tank mates.Let the vet know what specific symptoms your seahorse has, including when they started and what you’ve done to care for your pet.

, Certain species of marine life can help maintain the tank’s cleanliness from day to day. The best and safest cleaning crew members for your seahorse’s tank include:Brittle or serpent star
Lettuce nudibranch
Sea cucumbers
Sea hares
Peppermint or coral banded shrimp

, Sea horses are sensitive to their water flow and environment. Make sure that the tank filters and working properly at least one a day. Remove and either clean or replace any filters that are clogged, dirty, or not functioning properly. This can keep your seahorse healthy by removing excess food, decaying organic matter, free-floating particulate, toxic chemicals, and waste products from the water., Place an aquarium thermometer inside tank. Check the water temperature every day during one of the feedings. The temperature should be between 74 and 76 degrees Fahrenheit (23-24 degrees Celsius). This can prevent reduce possible odors and ensure the health of your seahorse., Fresh and clean water is important to maintaining the health of your seahorse. Replace 10-20% of the water once every week. Wipe down the tank walls and any decorations. Replacing the water regularly can prevent unpleasant odors and maintain the health of your seahorse."

Do not expect to breed your sharks.",How to Care for a Rainbow Shark," Rainbow sharks are not particularly large, only about 6 inches (15 cm). However, they are semi-aggressive and very territorial. These fish need plenty of space and hiding spots to prevent confrontations.You might be required to assemble the aquarium. Follow the instructions on the box, because these will vary from tank to tank.
Purchase a heater and filter to go with the tank. Be sure that the filter is designed for a tank of your size. Refrain from using an under-gravel filter, because it is not compatible with sand, which is the optimal substrate for rainbow sharks. You should also purchase a tank stand designed to accommodate an aquarium of your size. While it might be attractive to use a table or desk that you already own, these often will not be strong enough to hold a heavy tank. Similarly, putting an aquarium on the floor is very dangerous.;
, The tank should be placed far away from environmental factors that can cause large variations in temperature: windows, air conditioners, radiators, and air vents. It should also be located away from noise and foot traffic. Avoid spots near doors, on the floor, or in a busy hallway.


You should also try to find a place that is near a power plug, a water source, and where you have space to both work on and observe the tank., Gravel with sharp edges can scratch up and damage the rainbow shark. Very fine gravel or, even better, sand should be used as a substrate. Because the rainbow shark is territorial, you will also need plenty of places for the rainbow shark to hide.


Caves, tubes, and other tank decorations sold at pet stores can help prevent conflict between territorial fish.You should also purchase live plants for the tank. These are a good source of distraction for fish and help to keep the tank clean.

, Tap water should be fine for your shark, though you will need to treat it. Fill the tank near to the top, but leave a few inches of headspace. It is necessary to keep a layer of oxygen at the top of the tank.Once you introduce the shark, you'll need to keep the tank covered with a lid to prevent the shark from jumping out., Tap water usually contains chlorine and other substances that are harmful to your fish. You can purchase a water testing kit at the pet store to determine what chemicals you'll need to make the water safe for your shark. You will probably need a sodium thiosulfate solution to treat chlorine and Amquel to treat chloramine.


To get more information about the chemicals in your water supply, ask the local pet store owner or call the water utility directly.In addition to adding sodium thiosulfate and Amquel to the tank, treat the tank for pH levels. There are a variety of acids and bases that can be purchased at the pet store to adjust the pH level in your tank.Test the level and adjust the pH until it is in the range of 6.5 to 7.5 pH., It is important to allow time for the water to cycle and for the chemical composition of the water to stabilize. Continue to closely monitor the chemicals to verify that they are at safe levels.

, Rainbow sharks like a water temperature from 72-79 Fahrenheit. To keep the tank at this temperature, purchase a heater to go with your tank. Set the heater somewhere between the 72-29 degree temperature range.You should also be sure to keep your aquarium away from anything that could cause it to suddenly change temperature. For example, keep it away from widows, heaters, and vents.

, Even a shark cannot survive more than a couple of hours in the bag that the pet store gives you to bring it home in. When you bring the fish home, float the bag in the aquarium water for half an hour so that fish can adjust to the aquarium's water temperature. You can add some water from your tank to the bag to help the fish get used to the new water.Then use a net to transfer the fish into the tank. Discard the old water instead of adding it to the tank, since the waste in the water makes for an inhospitable environment. , Rainbow sharks are omnivorous and can and should eat most anything. Sharks will eat any common fish food, including pellets, flakes and algae wafers, as long as it sinks to the bottom of the tank. To give you sharks a brighter coloration, make sure to feed it small crustaceans a few times a week. Feed your shark two to three times daily.Experiment to determine how much you should feed your fish. A fish should eat its food within approximately five minutes. If anything is remaining after that period of time, you have given your fish too much food. Excess food will ultimately make the tank dirty.Good crustaceans to feed your fish include brine shrimp, blood worms, Daphnias, and artemias.You should also feed your sharks vegetables.Try Zucchini that has been sliced into small bits and boiled. Boiled peas can also be good. Rainbow sharks will eat some raw vegetables, including romaine lettuce, beet tops, and swiss chard. When feeding your fish cooked vegetables, be sure to let them cool before placing them in the aquarium., When you clean the tank, you do not need to remove all of the substrate (sand or gravel), however, you should use a siphon to suck up the waste that accumulates on the bottom of the tank. Use a scrapper to remove algae from the glass. After finishing these tasks, remove and replace 10-15% of the water.


Do not remove fish when changing the water. This will cause unnecessary stress.
When replacing the water, put new water into a bucket. Do not use this bucket for any other household tasks (it might accumulate dangerous chemicals). Test and treat the water as discussed previously. Use a siphon to slowly introduce the new water back into the tank., It is particularly important to watch for signs of illness with fish. That because many fish diseases are highly communicable and will spread rapidly throughout the tank. Many common causes of illness are also the result of bad water conditions and might quickly kill off all of your fish. Things to watch for include:


Scratching against objects in the tank
Duller coloration, changes in color pattern, and spotting
Gills and fins that have been chewed on
Lack of energy
Fins tightly held against the body
Bloating
Gasping for air at the surface of the water
Disappearing fin or tail, Rainbow sharks will be less likely to fight with other fish who can defend themselves against the rainbow shark. However, you need more than two, or else those will fight among themselves all the time. The rainbow shark will be most likely to fight with members of its own species.


If you do try to introduce another rainbow shark into the tank, you need at least a meter of separated territory for each of the sharks.
Rainbow sharks are most likely to get along with fish from the Chromobita, Botia, Syncrossus, and Yasuhikotakia genera. Gouramies, barbs, and danios are good companions.
Rainbow sharks will be more hostile toward fish from the Crossocheilus, Garra and Gyrinocheilus genera. Small fish and bottom feeders, including catfish and cichlids, are also more likely to be disturbed by rainbow sharks., If you include caves and tubes in the tank, your shark will claim these as its territory and be less likely to fight with other fish. Visit a fish store to see what type of hiding places are available. If your rainbow shark finds a cave that it likes to hide in, but is still prone to aggression, you can purchase a divider for your tank, that will prevent it from interacting with the other fish., Because these sharks are so prone to fight with other members of their species, it is very difficult, if not quite impossible to breed them. However, if you hope to do so you will have to provide a tank that is at least 75 gallons.


It is impossible to determine the sex of the shark as juveniles. Ever afterward, it is hard. The females will be slightly thicker and black lines on their fins.Rainbow sharks are most likely to breed after they have reached at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) long and during the months of October and November. You will likely need to treat them with hormones to encourage mating. They should be fed with high protein foods, like shrimp and tuna.
After fry hatch, they should be transferred to a separate 10-gallon tank and should be fed liquid fry food for two weeks before shifting to baby brine shrimp."

Choose a tank.,
Add ornaments.,
Get a filter.,
Cycle your tank.,
Test your water regularly.,
Choose your fish carefully.,
Acclimate your fish with care.,
Feed your fish every day.",How to Care for Coldwater Fish," It all comes down to the amount of money, space and time you are willing to invest in your new hobby. Goldfish are surprisingly not the easiest beginner pet that everyone thinks they are! In fact, they require a tank capacity of at least 20 gallons or 75 litres for your first goldfish, plus an additional 10 gallons or 37 litres for each subsequent goldfish added! These measurements are for fancy goldfish; common goldfish require at least 110 litres or 30 gallons in order to sustain a healthy active lifestyle. It really goes to show that these beauties are not meant for bowls after all!;
, Again, this is all up to you, but some would suggest getting smaller decor and fewer of them as it does takeaway a lot of swimming room for your fish. If your fish are slightly on the territorial side, more decorations will make good hiding places.

, Filters are vital as these fish are extremely messy and huge waste producers. Also people will often overfeed these fish too. It's best to get a filter that turns the water 4-5 times every hour (this information will be on the filter box; if you're still unsure consult a fish retailer as it is better to be safe than sorry). Don't ever change the filter media, as the helpful chemical eating bacteria live here.

, Cycling is a huge step many people miss. It is a complex and fascinating biological system that can take a while to process but is vital to fish keeping. You can purchase bacteria to give your filter the boost it needs to get the filtration going. Also never set up a tank without  a water conditioner as it removes chlorine which is deadly to fish. See How to Do a Fishless Cycle for more information on this.

, When you see that nitrite and ammonia are at 0 and that nitrate is under 15, you can then pick out your first fish. Make sure your tank is at room temperature at 65-75 degrees F.

, Picking fish is important because you have to make sure that the fish are healthy. Check their scales, fins and gills and compare to fish in surrounding tanks. If there is any white spots or illness or if you are unsure ask a member of staff. A healthy fish should also interact with your finger against the glass, so avoid fish that just sulk at the corners. Also, do your research on certain fish you would want to see if their species is right for your tank.

, Getting your fish acclimated to their environment is a very important step people often rush. Start off with one or two fish until your tank is within the stocking guidelines. Firstly, float the transport bag that your fish retailer will have put your fish into in the tank for 10-15 minutes. Next open the bag and add in a cup of tank water. Wait an additional 5-10 minutes. Now gently net your fish into their new home.

, Only use enough fish food that they can eat within a minute. Overfeeding them can lead to serious problems with the tank and your fish. Also, perform weekly water changes of about 10%-25% to keep the tank clean. Make sure the new water has been dechlorinated.

Because they are hearty, it is generally possible to keep danios without a heater. However, a heater is good for maintaining optimal conditions, especially if you plan to breed the danios.You might be required to assemble the tank. If so, follow the instructions on the box.;
, Local water companies will usually use some chemicals, like chlorine, that can be harmful to your fish. At the pet store purchase some testing kits to determine if the water is safe. You will probably want a sodium thiosulfate solution to treat chlorine and Amquel to treat chloramine.


To get more information about the chemicals in your water supply, ask the local pet store owner or call the water utility directly., Fish like a layer of gravel at the bottom of the tank. Keep approximately 1/4th of an inch of gravel in the tank., Simple tap water is generally good for your fish, though you will need to treat it. Fill the water nearly, though not all the way to the top of the tank. It is necessary to keep a layer of oxygen at the top of the tank. , In addition to adding sodium thiosulfate and Amquel to the tank, treat the tank for pH levels. There are a variety of acids and bases that can be purchased at the pet store to adjust the pH level in your tank.Test the level and adjust the pH until it is in the 6-8 range, preferably 7., Danios are social animals that like to be in the company of other fish. A group of 6 or more is optimal.Danios get along with some other varieties of fish as well, including corydoras and tetras., If you want to breed your fish, you should be sure to get some danios of different sexes. To distinguish between the two, remember that males have yellow stripes and females are generally larger.Danios breed rapidly when left to their own devices. However, they will often eat many of their fry., Even the mighty little Zebra Danio cannot survive longer than 8 hours in the bag that the pet store provides. When you transfer the fish to the tank, do not transfer the water they came in with them. It will have too much ammonium.

, Danios enjoy a variety of food sources. Commercial produced flakes will usually suffice. You can also feed them blood worms, daphnia, and brine shrimp., Danios are hearty and are comfortable in temperatures from 65 to 75 Fahrenheit.You can often maintain this temperature without a heater, but a heater will help. A slightly higher temperature, 78 Fahrenheit, is optimal for encouraging breeding., When you clean the tank, you do not need to remove all of the gravel, however, you should use a siphon to suck up the waste that accumulates on the bottom of the tank. Use a scrapper to remove algae from the glass on the tank. After finishing these tasks, remove and replace 10-15% of the water.


Do not remove fish when changing the water, this will cause unnecessary stress.
When replacing the water, put new water into a bucket that is exclusively used for this purpose (If you use it for household tasks it might accumulate dangerous chemicals). Test and treat the water as discussed previously. Use a siphon to slowly introduce the new water back into the tank."

Ideally you should have at least five or six danios, in a tank that holds at least 25 gallons (95 liters). A group of three fish in a smaller tank is acceptable, but can lead to stress or aggression. Never keep a zebra danio alone or in a tank smaller than 10 gallons (38L).;
, Add a layer of well-rinsed sand or gravel to the base of the dry tank. Add a few plants and ornaments as well, but keep the taller ones at the perimeter of the tank. Danios are active fish that need plenty of room to swim at the mid-level of the tank. The decorations are necessary so the fish can hide, but should not interfere with movement.

, If you are not familiar with aquarium care, read this article for more details. You may need to treat the water with a dechlorinator.

, A filter, air pump, aquarium light, and thermometer are standard supplies for any aquarium. Danios prefer temperatures around 70–75ºF (21–24ºC). Depending on the temperature conditions of your home, you may need a heater to regulate this temperature.


Danios like water movement. Make sure there is water movement from the water filter.

, It is very important to ""cycle"" a new aquarium before adding any fish. Use a test kit from an aquarium store to measure the amount of ammonia, nitrites, and nitrate. Do not add the fish until these measurements are stable at safe levels.


Your test kit can also measure water pH (acidity). Danios do best in water pH from 6.5-7.2.

, Some hobbyists add freshwater aquarium salt to their tanks in small amounts, as directed on the product label. This is a little controversial among aquarium owners. A little salt can help the fish fight off disease, but too much can have unwelcome side effects.


Only use freshwater aquarium salt, not ordinary salt.
Do not add salt more than once between water changes. Salt does not leave the tank, so adding more can cause a lethal overdose.

, As with any fish, danios should be introduced to the new tank slowly. Turn off the aquarium lighting and slowly introduce the aquarium water to the new fish's environment. The drip tube or floating bag methods are both good options.


If you have a large tank, introduce the new fish two or three at a time. Wait a week or two between introducing groups. This minimizes the disruption to your tank's chemistry, as well as stress on the fish.

, Zebra danios are not aggressive, so you can safely add smaller fish to the same tank. Avoid adding any aggressive fish species to the same tank.


Although zebra danios are peaceful, they are active swimmers. Some fish species may prefer a calmer environment.
Danios may be ""fin-nippers"", especially when they are not schooled with other fish.
A good aquarium store should have employees who can advise you on compatible species. Guppies, minnows, tetras, swordtails, corydoras (commonly cory cats), and betas are good examples.

, Zebra danios do not need any special feeding care and are not picky eaters, but overfeeding is a common cause of problems for all aquarium fish. A fish's stomach is about the size of the fish's eye.


Each danio should only need a couple bites of food each feeding, 2–3 times per week, but can be fed each day if the other fish in the aquarium need feeding each day. Overfeeding can cause bloating as well as harmful chemical build-up in your water.
Only feed the fish as much food as they can eat in 3 minutes. This is a general rule for all freshwater aquarium fish.

Unfortunately, online pet-care resources can differ greatly when it comes to tank recommendations for clown fish. Some sources recommend a minimum tank size of just eight to ten gallons, while others suggest a minimum of no less than 20 or 30 gallons (75.7 or 113.6 L).As a general rule, it's almost always better to have a tank that's too big than one that's too small, as small tanks require extra maintenance and can be much more susceptible to sanitation problems. Thus, for the clown fish's health and safety, most new owners should aim for at least a 20–30 gallon (75.7–113.6 L) tank.


The dangers of having a tank that's too small can't be overstated. If the filtration system in the tank is insufficient, impurities can quickly build up in the tank's water, leading to health problems for the fish like fin rot, marine ich, and more. In addition, if multiple fish share the tank, cramped quarters can cause territorial competition, which may lead to stress, injury, or even death.;
, Many first-time aquarium owners underestimate the ease of preparing and maintaining an aquarium. In fact, even the physical location of the tank can have a major effect on the health and happiness of the fish inside. As you plan a spot for your aquarium, keep the following tips in mind:


Aquariums should be out of direct sunlight and away from heaters, air conditioners, ventilation openings, and windows. Sudden changes in water temperature can be harmful to the fish.
Aquariums should be within range of an electrical outlet (to power the lighting and filtration systems), but shouldn't be up against a wall, as this usually makes it difficult to perform maintenance and change filters.
Aquariums usually weigh about 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) for every gallon of water they contain. This means that a 30 gallon (113.6 L) tank will weigh about 300 pounds (136 kilograms.) Keep this in mind when you're choosing a table or stand to support it.
Aquariums should be completely level with the ground.

, You do not want to discover that your tank contains a leak or is poorly constructed when it's completely full of water. A proper tank should be completely water-tight and completely level. Test for imperfections in either of these categories with the methods below:


Test for leaks by filling the tank to about 1/3 of the way full in a water-safe location (like a shower or your yard.) Dry the outside of the tank with a towel and wait about one hour. Look for beads of water along the corners or pooling of water at the base — if you see these signs, return your tank for a refund.
Test for levelness with a carpenter's level. Alternatively, add a few inches of water and marking the water line on either side — if the two lines differ, the tank is not level. Keep in mind that this may reflect a problem in the surface beneath it rather than in the tank itself.

, A good filtration system is crucial for any aquarium (especially, as noted above, smaller ones.) Unlike in the ocean, in an aquarium, there's nowhere for impurities from biological waste to go, so it's necessary to remove them via filter so that they don't build up and start harming the fish. Though filtration systems can vary greatly from product to product, below are some very general instructions for setting up a typical undergravel filter for a saltwater aquarium (consult your product's packaging or the personnel at a local pet store for more information):


Rinse all parts of the filtration system and place the lower filters (which usually resemble square grids or plates) at the bottom of the tank.
Attach all necessary tubes, valves, and air pumps to the lower filters. Usually, the filter system will contain something called a ""check valve"" which is marked with an arrow — the arrow should be pointing up and the valve should be about three to four inches from the main air pump.
Attach the lift tubes to the filter plates, then attach the powerheads to the lift tubes. The powerheads should sit below the surface of the water when the tank is full.

Note: A special, separate type of filter called a protein skimmer is recommended, but not always required., Rinse your substrate (the gravel-like substance you usually see at the bottom of home aquariums) in a kitchen colander before adding it to the tank. Be sure to use a specially-designed marine substrate recommended by your local pet store, not ordinary gravel from outdoors. If you're using an undergravel filtration system, the substrate should cover the filter plates completely in a thin layer about 1/2 inch to an inch thick.


If you're using airstones (decorative devices that produce bubbles and circulate the water), rinse them and add them to the bottom of the tank now.

, Clownfish are famous for spending much of their time hiding in the fronds of sea anemones and rocky crevices in coral reefs. Give your clown fish a happy home by adding plenty of rocks, plants, artificial reef formations, and decorations for it to hide in. Rinse each new addition to the tank before adding it. Though clown fish enjoy a mutually-beneficial relationship with sea anemones in the wild, you don't need to add sea anemones to your tank at home — having plenty of rocky crevices should be fine.


If you do intend to add sea anemones, know that they can be somewhat more difficult to care for than clownfish themselves, as they require a high-quality filtration system, good light, and frequent feeding. Consult an online aquarium resource like Aquacon.com for detailed anemone care information.The following sea anemone species make good hosts for clown fish:Entacmaea quadricolor, Heteractis magnifica, Stichodactyla gigantea, and Stichodactyla haddoni.


, If you have everything above sorted out and your tank appears to be in good working order, fill it to the top with water. Finally, add enough marine salt to produce a specific gravity of 1.020 to 1.026, which is the ideal salinity level for clown fish. The amount you need will differ based on the size of your tank — larger tanks will need more, while smaller tanks will need less. Consult your marine salt's packaging for exact usage instructions.


Most pet care resources recommend using a device called a hydrometer to measure the specific gravity of your tank — commercial-grade varieties are usually available at pet stores for cheap. In addition, many pet stores offer free water testing services.
Understand that tanks can require up to a day to achieve a uniform salinity, so be willing to let your tank sit for up to 24 hours after adding your salt.
Don't use table salt in place of marine salt. Marine salt contains special chemical additives not found in ordinary table salt., Your tank is ready to go! At this point, you may add your clown fish and start caring for it according to the directions in the section below!

, Compared to more finicky species of fish, clown fish have nutritional needs that are very easy to meet. Clownfish should readily consume most commercial marine fish flakes. For maximum growth, try adding a pinch of fish flakes to the tank about once per day. You want to add about enough food each feeding that fish can consume all of it within about two or three minutes.Most clown fish will survive just fine with feedings every-other day. However, this will slow down their rate of growth.
Since clown fish are omnivorous, they can also eat both vegetable and animal matter, so consider occasionally adding small chunks of algae, shrimp, cut-up worms, and so on to the tank for a greater range of nutrition. Your fish should appreciate this!

, Clown fish are native to tropical parts of the ocean — specifically, the warmer parts of the eastern Indian ocean and the western Pacific ocean extending from the equator all the way to Australia.To replicate the warm, mellow waters of the tropics, keep your aquarium at a temperature of about 75-85o F (about 24-30o C.)


If you don't live in the tropics, you can keep your tank warm year-round with a submersible heater — these resemble long, skinny tubes that insert easily into the corner of an aquarium. Because heaters range in size and power, be sure to buy a heater that's rated for your size of tank.

, Ideally, your tank should have its own lighting system to provide any plants in it with much-needed solar energy for photosynthesis. Part of your daily maintenance should be to make sure that this light turns off at night. This replicates the normal cycle of day and night that your tank's inhabitants would experience in the wild and also helps keeps the plants and algae in your tank from growing too rapidly.


Note that most aquarium lights have timers that allow you to easily set them to an automatic cycle.

, Breakdowns in your tank's filtration system can create a toxic environment for your fish over time. To prevent this, it's important to check every part of your filtration system regularly, if not daily. This shouldn't take more than a few seconds — all you need to do is quickly make sure that everything appears to be functioning correctly. Below are a few quick tips on what to look for:


Filter: All pumps should be running smoothly and water should be flowing through the filter without trouble. There should be no obstructions in any of the lines.
Aerators: A small, continuous stream of bubbles should be floating out of the aerator.
Protein skimmer: Water should be passing through the skimmer easily; foam should be generating inside the skimmer. The waste collector should not be full — if it is, empty it.

, In addition to checking your water quality devices daily, it's important to test the water itself to ensure your clown fish has optimal conditions to thrive in. Right after you set up your tank, you'll want to check the water quality about once per day, but as your measurements stabilize at a suitable level, you can start to check about once per week. Below are ideal water quality measurements (along with the tools you'll need to measure them, all of which should be available at your pet store):


Temperature: 75-85o F (about 24-30o C) — thermometer
Salinity: Specific gravity of 1.020 to 1.026 — hydrometer
pH: 8.0-8.4 — pH meter (see: [[Test Ph in a Fish Tank|our pH-testing article)
Ammonia: 0.0 (too low to detect) — Ammonia test kit
Nitites: < 0.2 parts per million — Nitrite test kit

, If you find during one of your routine test that your aquarium doesn't meet one of the important quality metrics above , don't waste time — immediately address the source of the problem to keep your clown fish healthy. See below:


Temperature: If too high, reduce heater settings; if too low, increase heater settings or buy a heater that's rated for your tank size.
Salinity: If too high, replace some tank water with fresh water; if too low, add marine salt.
pH: There are many causes for incorrect pHs; consult a fish care resource for specific strategies. Be sure to make any pH adjustments gradually — rapid changes can harm fish.Ammonia: If you detect any ammonia, your levels are too high — check the filtration system for problems. Consider replacing your filters. If your filtration system is working, it may be too small for the size of your tank or the number of fish you have.
Nitrites: See ammonia.

, Though aquariums are often described as ""closed systems,"" in reality, they still require the regular addition of outside water to stay clean and habitable for your fish. You don't have to replace the water all at once, however — instead, you can do it gradually and continuously by removing about a quarter of the water every two to three weeks and replacing it with new water.


Keep in mind, however, that your new water must be the correct salinity for your ank unless you want to cause a potentially dangerous dip in salt levels.

, Adding more fish to your tank is a great way to make your clown fish's life more interesting. However, it's generally considered best to add new fish to the tank one by one over a period of time, rather than adding many at once. This gives the clown fish (whose species is known for being somewhat territorial) time to adjust to the new visitor. Be willing to take at least six months to get your tank to maximum capacity.In addition, taking a gradual approach can prevent sudden ammonia ""spikes"" which can be deadly to fish. The sudden addition of many fish to the same tank will cause ammonia levels from the fish's waste to soar quicker than the bacteria in the tank (which neutralize the ammonia) have a chance to grow.
Keep in mind the maximum capacity of your tank as you add new fish. As a very general rule, you should have a maximum of one ""inch of fish"" per 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water in the tank. For example, a 30 gallon (113.6 L) tank could hold a maximum of about 12 1-inch fish or six 2-inch fish or four 3-inch fish, etc.

, If you match them with peaceful, non-aggressive species, clown fish can be great neighbors. On the other hand, if you match them with territorial, aggressive species, they can get into fights, leading to injuries (or even death) for both fish. Below are some examples of gentle species that pair well with clown fish:Wrasses
Tangs
Gobies
Dartfish
Angelfish
Damselfish
Pufferfish
Anemones
Marine Invertebrates
Coral

Note: Do not pair clown fish with other clown fish of the same species — they are likely to fight.

, The buildup of biological waste is one of the number one threats to an aquarium fish's health. To deal with danger, it can be a great idea to add a few invertebrate scavengers to deal with the waste. These sorts of animals usually feed on decaying plant and animal matter, making them perfect for cleaning up leftover waste and easing the burden on your filter system. Best of all, they're not likely to fight with clown fish for territory or resources. Some good choices are:


Marine snails
Small crabs
Starfish

, Fin rot is a common aquarium ailment whose symptoms look like its name suggests: decaying, dirty-looking fins that seem to be falling apart and sometimes swelling at the base of the fin. This is almost always a water quality issue, so, if you see this, take the following steps:


Check the filtration system for errors and, if necessary, clean or replace the filter.
Consider increasing the pace that you replace your tank's water
Consider adding scavengers (see above)
Consider getting aquarium antibiotics from a vet or pet store
Remove built-up algae (see below)

, Marine ich (not ""itch"") is a common problem in saltwater aquariums caused by a microscopic parasite that burrows into the fish's skin and gills. This illness can have a variety of symptoms, including small white ""dots"" on the skin and gills, clouded eyes, excessive skin mucus, difficulty breathing, and discoloration. In this case, the most direct fix is usually to add copper-based anti-parasite additives to the water and to improve the water quality with the tips above.


Another tactic is to quarantine all of your tank's fish in a separate tank with low salinity. This disrupts the parasite's natural life cycle, killing it. Consult a saltwater aquarium resource for more information., Over time, algae, a creeping green ""slime"" or ""moss""-like organism, will usually gradually build up in an aquarium. A little bit of algae can be a good thing, as clown fish and other marine life can feed on it. However, if allowed to grow out of control, algae can eventually spread throughout the tank and start competing with the other organisms for light and nutrients, essentially smothering them. To prevent this, it's best to deal with algae as early as possible with preventative measures. Use the following steps to manage algae growth:Keep the tank free of organic waste — don't overfeeds your fish and don't crowd too many organisms into a single tank.
Have other plants in your tank — normal plant life will compete with algae for the same resources.
Use a scraper or squeegee to regularly remove algae from the walls of the tank.
Don't leave your tank's lights on overnight.
Stock your tank with a species that eats lots of algae, like catfish.

Create a scrapbook of your child’s favorite memories.",How to Help Your Child When a Pet Dies," Sometimes people avoid telling children about the death of a pet right away because the conversation can be so difficult. When a pet dies, it is best to tell your child soon after it happens rather than avoiding or putting off the conversation. Your child may feel betrayed if you wait to tell him or her about the death of your pet., It is important to be honest with your child and avoid using phrases like “put to sleep” and “passed away” because these expressions may confuse your child. Tell your child in a direct manner that your pet has died and that there was nothing that could be done.


Do not share any details with your child that may be traumatic. For example, do not describe the cause of your pet’s death to your child., The concept of euthanasia might be difficult for very young children (five or younger) to understand. Older children might have an easier time understanding, but you may have to answer some difficult questions as well.For example, your child may ask if euthanasia is like killing the animal. Do your best to provide honest answers to your child, but do not go into too much detail to avoid upsetting your child.

, Your child’s reaction may vary depending on his or her age and prior experiences with death. For example, a young child may be very sad and then seem fine a few minutes later, while a teenager may respond with anger and storm off.Keep in mind that people respond to death in a variety of different ways. Even if your child seems fine, he or she may be working through a wide range of confusing emotions.

, Make sure that your child knows that you are willing to listen if he or she wants to talk. Your child may want to talk right away, in a few days, or not at all. If your child decides that he or she wants to talk, give your full attention.Allow your child to express his or her feelings while you listen.
Offer a shoulder to cry on if your child begins to cry.
Reassure your child that these emotions are difficult now, but they will get better over time.
After you have finished talking, give your child a hug.

, Your child may express feelings of guilt or worry about the death of a pet. Some children may feel like they caused the death or like they did not treat the pet well enough while the pet was alive or that the pet could have been saved. Make sure that you reassure your child about any source of guilt that he or she may have.For example, if your child is worried that more could have been done to save the life of the pet, reassure your child that the veterinarian did all that he or she could to save the pet’s life.

, Your child will most likely have lots of questions about the death of a pet, especially if this is your child’s first experience with death. Do your best to answer these questions, but keep in mind that it is okay to say “I don’t know.” For example, if your child asks questions the afterlife of animals, you may want to use the teachings of your spiritual background to help inform your answer, or you may choose to leave this more open ended and say, “I'm not sure.” You can explain what some people believe, and if you're undecided about what happens, you can tell this to your child. Then you can share with your child a picture of what you hope the pet is experiencing right now, such as having all the doggie bones he can eat without getting a bellyache, and miles of soft grass and sunshine.
Some questions you should answer in a definite, clear way. For example, if your child asks whether or not the pet suffered when he died, then you should be honest, but aim to comfort your child. You might say something like, “Fido was in pain when he went to see the veterinarian, but the veterinarian gave him some medicine to help the pain go away before he died.”

, It might be tempting to allow your child to miss soccer practice or to skip a friend’s birthday party because he or she is feeling sad, but it is better to keep your child active and involved. If your child starts to pull away from activities and friends, this may be harmful to your child in the long run.

, Keep in mind that it is okay to cry in front of your child, but avoid letting your emotions get out of control. For example, do not sob in front of your child. This may frighten or overwhelm your child. Make sure that you excuse yourself if you begin to become overwhelmed by your emotions., In some situations, children may have a hard time letting go of a much-loved pet. In these situations, counseling may be the best option. You can talk to your child’s school counselor to arrange a meeting or look into a therapist who works with children. Some things that indicate that your child may be struggling with grief include:Constant sadness.
Ongoing sadness (more than a month).
Difficulty in school.
Trouble sleeping or other physical symptoms that started after the death of your pet.

, The process of burying or scattering a pet’s ashes can be a good way to help your child say goodbye ad grieve. Plan a special ceremony to honor the life of your pet. You might even ask your child to help you plan the ceremony, if you think that he or she would like to do so., Your child might also find it helpful to draw a picture of the deceased pet or to write a letter to the pet that expresses how he or she feels. Ask your child if either of these activities sound appealing and offer your support.


You can guide your child through the process by sitting nearby and offering support if he or she wants advice on what to draw or what to say in the letter.
After your child has drawn a picture or composed a letter, invite your child to put it somewhere special, such as on the pet’s grave or in a favorite sleeping spot.

, Your child may also like the idea of planting a special tree or flower in the backyard to honor your pet. Ask your child to help you pick out a tree or flower to plant. Then, choose a spot together and plant the tree or flower in your pet’s honor.

, An indoor memorial can also be a great way for your child to remember a beloved pet. Try setting aside a special place for a favorite photo of the pet, such as on the mantle over the fireplace or on a small end table. Put the photo into a nice picture frame and place the photo in the special spot. Invite your child to help you light a candle next to the picture frame to help keep the memory of your pet alive., Ask your child to help you put together a scrapbook of favorite memories with your pet. Pick out some photos that have special significance to your child and help your child put these photos into a scrapbook. Let your child keep the scrapbook in his or her room so that he or she can always look through it to remember happy times with the beloved pet.

Check your local laws.,
Decide on a burial spot.",How to Bury a Pet1," Check for a pulse, and look and feel to see if she's still breathing. She may be in trouble but not actually dead. Call your veterinarian, and ask her to guide you with next steps.If your pet is still alive, take her to an emergency vet in the area.
The best place to feel for a pulse on a dog or cat is the inner thigh, up where the leg meets the body. You're looking for the femoral artery. Use two fingers (not a thumb) to check for a pulse. You may have a hard time feeling it on a cat.If you feel a pulse, have someone time 15 seconds while you count beats. Multiple by 4, and you have the beats per minute. Your vet will likely want to know the beats per minute if possible.;
, The body will start to decompose fairly quickly, usually within a day, so you want to bury the body as soon as possible. If you need to keep the body in your home, you can take a few steps to keep it from decomposing.You can wrap the body and put in the refrigerator, though you still want to take action within a day. You can also place the body in the freezer, which will keep it from decomposing longer.
If you can't use either of these options, leave the body unwrapped on concrete, as it will draw the heat out.

, In your grief, you may not remember everyone you need to tell. For instance, it's important to notify kids who were away at college when the pet died. You also need to find a way to tell your children if you have young ones in your home.When telling kids, try not to use euphemisms. For instance, saying the pet has been ""put to sleep"" can be confusing. Tell the child that the pet died, and explain in simple terms what that means. For instance, you could say, ""Honey, I have something sad to tell you. Our pet Kitty died today. That means that she stopped breathing and her body stopped moving. She won't be coming back to live with us.""It can help to let the child see the body, though it's okay to soften the blow by covering the body partially with a blanket or putting a beloved toy nearby.
Answer any questions your child has as honestly and directly as you can, though you can say you don't know. Also, be prepared for the ways your child's grief will appear. Some children will want to write letters or leave flowers. Others may want some alone time, while still others may need more cuddles.

, Letting your pets observe the body, sniff it, and interact with it can help give the pet closure. If they can see the dead body, they may not spend as long looking for the pet to come back after she's buried., You may or may not be allowed to bury your pet on your own property. It's typically not okay to bury in a public park, but sometimes you can bury your pet on your own property.Try calling your vet to see if she knows the local law. You can also ask your local humane society.
If you're still not sure, try calling the local police department to ask.

, Once you know whether you're allowed to bury your pet in your yard, you may decide to bury her there. However, you do have other options. For instance, some cities have pet burial parks where you can buy a plot for your pet.To find a pet cemetery, ask your vet. You can also look under ""pet cemeteries"" in your local area.Another option besides burial is cremation. Some vet hospitals have cremation services, while other times, the crematory is a stand alone service.Be aware that you may have the option of individual cremation (where you just get your pet's remains back) or group cremation (where your pet is cremated with other animals). Individual cremation is more expensive.

Know your other options.",How to Bury a Pet2," Whenever you're digging in your yard, you're supposed to call about buried utility lines first. That way, you won't run into them when you're digging, which could cause problems., For instance, it's important to pick a high, dry location if you want your pet to decompose. In addition, you should pick a location downhill from a well and at least 50 feet away, though 100 feet is better, as well as 50 feet from other types of water such as ponds, rivers, and drainage ditches. Try to pick a place that is not shallow to the bedrock below (meaning, see if you hit rock below where you are digging), as when the pet is decomposing, it can leach into the water., First, find a heavy duty plastic bag that fits your animal. Next, find a box. Wood or metal is the best option because it keeps the pet enclosed. You can also decorate it if you wish.If you want your pet to decompose into the earth, you shouldn't cover your pet with anything. You should only allow your pet to decompose into the earth if your pet died of natural causes.
However, if your pet was euthanized, it's not safe to let her naturally decompose into the earth, so you should cover her., For a larger pet, you want the hole to be at least 3 feet deep. You might get away with 2 feet if the pet is smaller. Keep in mind that you may need to go deeper depending on the size of your box. Make sure to make the hole wide enough and long enough to fit the box you put your pet in.If you want your pet to decompose into the earth, you should bury the pet in a shallower grave. The hole needs to be about a foot and a half deep, making sure that you have about a foot between the top and the bedrock below. Make sure you have a foot and a half of soil above the pet, even if you have to mound it up a bit.
Making the grave shallower gives the body a chance to decompose.
If you're having trouble digging in your soil, you can ""bury"" your pet above ground. Simply lay your pet out, and then cover it with soil in a mound equal to 18 inches., Lower your animal into the ground in the box. Cover the box up with the dirt, packing it down as you go. If you're not using a box, simply lay your pet in the ground. You can also bury your pet with some of her favorite toys or a flower., You can give it a small ceremony by reading a poem or saying a few words. You could also light candles in your home in memory of your pet. Having a funeral, even a small one in your home, can help you and your family say goodbye to your pet.


Think about what you'd do at a person's funeral. For instance, you may want to read a short story or have someone offer a eulogy to your pet.
Get your kids involved. Let them read a favorite poem or story or something they wrote for the pet.
You could also play a favorite song, or enjoy ""human food"" that your pet loved.

, Stones will serve to mark the spot of your pet. However, they also serve an equally important utilitarian purpose: keeping scavengers from digging your beloved pet up.You can choose a decorative stone as a headstone.
You could also plant something over your pet, such as rosebush, in your pet's memory.

, If you aren't physically capable of burying the pet yourself, some areas will let you put them in a (closed) trash can after you've wrapped them up in an old t-shirt or plastic.Another option is animal control or services, who might come pick up your animal.Your sanitation department may also pick up animal bodies.While it seems sad to dispose of your animal this way, know you loved your pet well while it was alive. All that's left is the body, not the pet you treasured so much. If you want, consider placing a stone in your yard to remember your pet by.

Decide on a funeral.",How to Bury a Pet3," If you have several options, you need to consider a few things. Price is, of course, sometimes a factor in what you choose. You may also want a location near your house. Finally, you should ask if the cemetery is dedicated. That means that it says in the deed that it will always be a cemetery, even if the land is sold to someone else., In some cemeteries, you'll have the option of an individual grave site or a group site. In a group site, your pet would be buried with other pets.You might also have the option of a grave, mausoleum, or crypt.In some areas, you may only have the option of group burial., Just like a regular cemetery, you'll likely have the option of choosing a plot if you pick an individual site. You'll work with the cemetery manager to find the one that you want.


You will need to pay for the plot before your pet is buried. You can also buy one in advance before your pet passes away.Keep in mind that some cemeteries require you to pay a maintenance fee each year if you have a plot for your pet there., Just like a standard cemetery, you have the option of headstones. Work with the cemetery to choose one that you like for your pet., Many pet cemeteries can work with you to set up a funeral if you wish. However, you don't necessarily need to have one if you don't want one or can't afford it."

Give family and friends a chance to say goodbye.",How to Cope with Losing a Pet1," At some point, we all need to come to terms with the mortality of our beloved pets. There are very few animals that, as pets, have the expected lifespan of humans. If your pet is ill or is a ""senior"" pet, it's a good time to talk with your veterinarian about your pet's continued quality of life.;
, When talking with your vet, ask if and how much pain your pet is experiencing. Knowing this will help you make the right decision for your pet, and knowing that you make the best choices for your pet helps you better cope with the loss of a pet. Consider the animal's quality of life. Is (s)he in pain? Can the pain or illness be treated medically, and still offer your pet a good quality life? Does (s)he have a good appetite? Is your pet happy? Finally, give thought to whether medical treatment is financially viable for you. For most of us, finances do need to be a consideration, albeit a very unpleasant one. Based on the vet's assessment and your own judgment, make the decision, with your pet's happiness in mind. If you're not sure, consider getting a second opinion from another vet.

, You will want something to remember it by. Even if (s)he looks sick and miserable, it is very important to take photos and video, as bittersweet as it may feel. In the future, you may wish to boast about what a wonderful pet you had, and you may want to show people what he or she looked like. Collect anything else you want to remember her or him by. This includes a favorite toy, a blanket, or a decorative element from a tank or cage. Consider taking a clipping of your pets hair.


You can also dip your pets paw in a small bit of paint and place it on a piece of paper that you can later display after the pet has died.

, Let your pet know how much you love him or her, and cherish every moment. Pet your special one in all its favorite places, and above all else make sure s/he is comfortable. Talk and maybe even sing. Do things that your pet has always enjoyed, when still able, like letting curling up on your lap for hours at a time, giving plenty of time to roam in the yard, and eating yummy little treats. If there was ever a time to spoil your pet, this is it. Discuss your pet's diet with your vet. If your pet is at an advanced age, a change in diet may make your pet happier on many levels - offering a diversity of foods and/or foods that are easier to eat or digest (and help prevent weight loss). At the same time, respect your pet's wishes; if (s)he wants to be left alone, don't violate your pet's comfort. Let your pet have his or her way.

, It is usually a painless and peaceful process for your pet, but most important, you will be with your beloved pet in its last moments, helping to ease its way along. Remind the Vet to give an anesthetizing agent so that your pet goes to sleep BEFORE the actual injection occurs that ends his/her life. Holding and petting your animal can give you as much comfort as it gives your pet, and though it's a sad experience, it's one that will help you to feel you did all you could for your pet in this world.

, When preparing for the loss of a pet, you also need to prepare for all the practicalities that follow. They are an absolute nightmare if you're unprepared - and may add to your grief and stress at the time. You want to ensure you've taken care of all arrangements before hand. You may wish to bury it in your yard with or without a grave marker. You can also have it buried in a cemetery or cremated.

, Before your beloved pet leaves your home forever, let the people who've enjoyed his/her presence know that it's not going to be around for much longer. You've been given a chance to say goodbye, and so should they. Assuming your pet feels comfortable with people, getting attention from various sources will make you and your pet feel more loved.

Forget all that nonsense that you're not supposed to mourn an animal as much as you would a person. There was a bond that you cherished, and no matter the nature of the bond, it is missed.

, You might send out a mass e-mail, but not to everyone in your address book. Send it to those who know you well, and care about you. You will receive many responses that let you know others loved and appreciated your pet and will validate your feelings.

, Don't pretend you never had one. Even though it makes you sad, it is best to remember and cherish the memories, not ignore them. It may hurt at first, but it's the only path to closure, and it's the only way you'll ever be able to remember fondly your time with your pet.

This way, you and your family can visit your pet's grave easily whenever you want. However, you need to make sure to look into the legality of this. Call a local courthouse to see if there are regulations on burying animals in your backyard in your area.Make sure you have room to bury you pet if you choose home burial. Find a spot away from hazards, like underground wiring.
Think about whether this option is right for you. Some people find it comforting to have a pet buried so near to them, while others find the reminder difficult.;
, Most veterinarian's offices provide cremation services for grieving owners. If you have no room for a home burial, or would prefer to live without the reminder, cremation can be a good option. You can put your pet's ashes on display or scatter them in an area that was important to you and your pet., Conduct an internet search to see if there are pet cemeteries near you. For a price, you can have your pet buried in a cemetery alongside other lost pets. This is a good option if you want a burial for your pet, but would prefer not to have a grave in your backyard. Pet cemeteries are also convenient, as your pet's body will be taken care of for you and the grave will be cared for.The major downside to pet cemeteries is the price. The cost of space and any related services can get high, so get a cost estimate before deciding to go this route.

Be aware that everyone experiences grief in different ways.,
Try to avoid feeling guilty for the death of your pet.,
Confront your feelings of denial.,
Release your anger in healthy ways.,
Let yourself feel sad but fight off depression.",How to Cope After the Death of a Pet1," Grief is an intense process and often happens gradually. Everyone processes grief differently and there no “normal” timeframe from grieving so you may feel better after several weeks, months, or even after a year. Be patient and allow yourself to experience grief for your pet, as this is an important way to process the death of your pet.Though you may try to ignore the pain, this will likely only make it worse. Rather than bottle up your feelings and emotions, it can be more useful to allow yourself to go through the stages of grief and heal over time. You may experience several of the stages of grief or only a few of them, but whatever your grieving process is, it’s important that you let it occur and do not keep your emotions hidden or suppress your feelings of sadness and loneliness.;
, One of the initial stages of grief is feeling guilt and responsibility for the death of your pet. Try to avoid asking “what ifs” and thinking about “if only”. This will only make you feel worse and make it more difficult to move past your grief.Take the time to remind yourself that you are not responsible for the death of your pet and that the death of your pet was out of your control. If you believe in a higher power, you may pray on your pet’s death and talk to the higher power as a way to work through your feelings of guilt.

, Another initial stage of grief is denial, where you may feel like your pet is still alive. You may have difficulty coming home to not find your pet waiting for you or not having to put out dinner every night, like you usually do, for your pet. Rather than tell yourself your pet might still be alive somewhere, it’s important that you are upfront and honest about the reality of the situation. Denial of your pet’s death will make it more difficult for you to move past your pet’s death and cope., A key emotion in the grieving process is anger, which can be directed at the driver of the car that killed your pet, the illness that killed her, or the vet who “failed” to save your pet’s life. Though your anger may feel justified, holding on to it can lead to feelings of resentment and rage, which will only make you feel worse in the long run. Anger can also distract you from resolving your feelings of grief and cause you to hold onto your grief, rather than release it and start to heal.Releasing your anger in a healthy way may mean leaning on the support of your family and friends, or focusing on self-care, where you do activities that make you feel good like hiking outdoors, doing a creative project, or socializing with good friends. Think of activities that can help you to release your anger in a way that feels useful and healthy, rather than destructive and painful.

, A natural symptom of grief is feelings of depression, which can leave you feeling powerless to cope with your emotions. While it is healthy and important that you let yourself feel sad about the death of your pet, feeling depressed can cause you to feel worn out, lonely, and isolated.Fight off feelings of depression by leaning on friends and family, occupying your time with activities you enjoy doing, and spending time creating a tribute for your pet. Focus on trying to work through your feelings of sadness so they do not develop into feelings of depression.

Try training.,
Keep your animal active.,
Create a routine.",How to Help a Pet Grieve1," Engaging your pet's mind and body in an activity that it enjoys can help take its mind off of its loss. Try positive training, a method rich with positive reinforcement, to keep your pet focused on an activity other than grieving.Work on teaching your pet a new trick. If you haven't trained your pet at all, start with basic commands like ""sit"" and ""come."" If your pet already knows the basics, try more difficult commands like ""jump"" or ""roll over.""
Make sure to use positive reinforcement for good behavior. This can include providing physical attention like petting and scratching, as well as giving your pet a treat when it performs a behavior correctly.
Try not to express anger when your pet does not perform a behavior correctly. Simply do not offer them reinforcement. If you have trouble providing a proper training environment yourself, seek help from a professional trainer.;
, Another way to keep your pet's mind off their grief is to engage them in an activity they already love. Many dogs enjoy walks, playing with their toys, or trips to the dog park, while pets like birds might enjoy a new toy in their cage.Try to keep your distractions as consistent as possible. This gives your pet a sense of normalcy. Walk your pet at the same times each day, or allow it space out of its cage or enclosure at regular intervals.
If your pet likes being around other people, invite friends or family over a couple days a week to play.

, Your animal will benefit greatly during a time of rough transition from a routine it knows it can count on. Help your pet by setting aside time each day to care for it and provide for its needs.Try to keep feeding and walks on a schedule, but make time for things like attention, too. For example, you could plan 15 minutes every morning and 30 minutes every evening to simply sit with your pet and pet or scratch them, play with them, or allow them to perch.
Your routine may vary some depending upon your personal schedule. This is normal. Just try to keep as many of the same elements in your daily routine as possible to help give your pet things to look forward to each day.

Share your feelings and emotions with family and friends.,
Reach out to friends who have also lost pets.,
Practice self-care through socializing and staying busy.,
Talk to a grief therapist, if needed.",How to Cope After the Death of a Pet2," Rather than keep your grief to yourself, do not be afraid to share your feelings with close family and friends. If a friend offers to stop by for a visit, say “yes”, even if you do not feel like talking to someone. Simply sitting with a sympathetic friend and talking about trivial things can make you feel less lonely and isolated. Reach out to your family and try to see them more often, as they can offer comfort and kind thoughts that can help you remember your pet fondly and process your grief.Keep in mind some people may not understand how deep your loss is over your pet. They may ask, “What’s the big deal? It’s just a pet!” Family or friends may not be able to understand how the loss of an animal can compare to the loss of a person, and they may not be as sympathetic as you may expect. Try not to take this personally, as they may not have a pet of their own and so cannot understand your connection with your deceased pet.

, Seek out family and friends who will be sympathetic to your grief and understand how it feels to lose a pet. Spend time together talking about your pets and sharing memories of your pets. You should find mutual understanding and connection with other pet owners who have also experienced loss and grief.You can also reach out to others who may understand pet loss through online pet loss support groups and online message boards. Support from other pet owners can be key to helping you process your grief.

, Self-care is very important when you are feeling low and can help you feel better physically and mentally. Look after your emotional needs by socializing with others and doing activities with others you enjoy to stay busy and not dwell on your grief. This could be exploring a new hobby like painting, drawing, or running by joining a class or group. Or you could join a fitness group to ensure you exercise regularly to boost your mood and fight off feelings of depression.You can also practice self-care on your own by doing a solo activity you enjoy, pampering yourself with a massage or a long bath, and taking time alone to read or do something calming and relaxing. Try not to spend too much time alone as you cope with the loss of your pet, as this can lead to isolation and loneliness. Maintain a balance of time with others and time with yourself to ensure you are taking care of your physical and emotional needs during this hard time.

, Sometimes, grief can be overwhelming and you may find you are still feeling depressed and upset even after you talk to family and friends. If your grief is causing you to feel powerless and unable to function, you may want to ask your doctor for a referral to a grief therapist. You can also ask family and friends for a referral to a grief therapist they may have gone to themselves, with positive results.

Arrange a funeral or a memorial service for your pet.,
Create a physical reminder of your pet.,
Donate to an animal charity in memory of your pet.,
Take care of any other pets in your household.,
Consider getting a new pet.",How to Cope After the Death of a Pet3," The ritual of a funeral or a memorial service can be a healthy way to grieve and process your emotions. This could be a small service honoring your pet’s life or a more elaborate affair. Though some people may consider it inappropriate to have a funeral for a pet, you should do what feels good to you as a pet owner and take the necessary steps to release your grief., This could be planting a tree in memory of your pet, creating a photo album of your pet, or commissioning a physical gravestone for your pet. Having a physical legacy of your pet can help you to celebrate your pet and move on in your grief., You may want to pay tribute to your animal companion by donating your money or time to an animal charity in his name. This will allow you to give back to the community and help other pet owners to take care of their pets. It also creates a tribute to your pet that focuses on caring for others and supporting others, a positive legacy you can feel proud of., Though it may be difficult to focus on the needs of your other pets after the death of a pet, you should try to devote yourself to providing good care to any other animals in your home. Your other pets will likely also be mourning the loss of a fellow pet, especially if they all lived together in close quarters. Focusing on the needs of your other pets can help you to move forward and cope with your loss. It can also be a way to honor your deceased pet by ensuring all your other pets receive love and care., Another way to cope and pay tribute to your pet is to perhaps get a new pet. Rather than see the new pet as a replacement for your deceased pet, think of the new pet as a new chapter in pet ownership. A new pet will allow you to love and care for an animal and to move forward from the death of a pet.


Some pet owners may feel they cannot get a new pet because it would be disloyal to their deceased pet. It may take time after the death of your pet to consider getting a new pet, but a new pet may be a healthy way to move through your feelings of grief and feel better about coming home to a pet filled house again.

Go to your local hardware store.,
Place at the head of the grave.",How to Make a Pet Grave Marker2," Go to the garden decoration section. Here you're bound to find a wide array of possible items that would make ideal grave markers. Some examples include:


Statues, figurines and metallic cut-outs of animals (you could even match the animal to your loved pet's own species)
Flowerbed decorations such as flower cut-outs, mushroom statues,
Solar lights
Baubles, glass beads, wind chimes, etc. If the items need hanging, you'll need either a post or tree branch to hang the items from.

, If the decoration has space and the surface is appropriate, you might consider painting or marking the pet's name onto it.

Find a suitable mold for forming the marker from.,
Place the mold onto a suitable surface.,
Prepare the cement for the mold.,
Transfer to the mold, filling it to halfway.,
Lay down the piece of chicken wire when you've half filled the mold.,
Make the top layer of cement smooth by using a cement trowel.,
Set aside to allow the cement to set.,
Use a craft stick, twig or end of a cheap artist's brush to write the details on the cement.,
Add decorations.,
Allow to set completely.,
Finish off the marker by sealing with an outdoor waterproof sealant.,
Done.",How to Make a Pet Grave Marker3," This could be a silicone mold from a dollar store or something as simple as a leftover disposable cake container. Select a suitable shape that will leave plenty of space for writing the pet's details on and adding some decorative effects.

, It is recommended that you put down a few layers of newspaper, to catch any cement slops as you work with the cement; it's much easier to throw out the paper than scrape it off the ground.


Put old clothes and shoes on. If cement slops onto these, it won't matter.

, Place sufficient cement mix into an old bucket. Add water according to the manufacturer's instructions and mix to combine. It should have a thick consistency when it is ready to use.

, While it is possible to simply pour the cement from the bucket straight into the mold, this can be messy if you have an accident. It's best to use a yogurt or dip container that can be disposed of after use and dip this into the cement, transferring small portions of cement to the mold at a time.

, Once in place, continue scooping in the remaining concrete mix until you read the top of the mold (or wherever you'd like it to end).

, You can also use your hand provided you're wearing rubber or latex gloves.

, The setting time will depend on the manufacturer's recommendations, the humidity and warmth. The important thing is to not let it completely set, as you're going to write in it but it also needs to be sufficiently set to ensure that the writing doesn't just disappear. Wait at least half an hour to an hour, then try writing.

, Write your pet's name as a minimum. If wished, you can write the date of birth and death, a favorite word/saying or something else meaningful.


If you make mistakes, just use the same method for making the top smooth as you did before, then start over.

, This is optional but can add character to the whole design. Things such as glass cabochons, small plastic toys, or the pet's favorite something (make sure it will weather okay) can be included in the cement.


You could make a border using small tiles, beads, etc. around the edges, if wished.
A laminated photo of the pet could be included. Cut down to size, such as making it circular or a square.

, Once it is properly set, you can either stop here or you can paint the writing using acrylic paint suitable for outdoor use. If you do paint the letters, allow them to fully dry before sealing the whole marker.

, Polyurethane sealant added thinly in about five coats should protect the marker well. Allow to dry completely between each coat and before using as a marker.

, Place the marker at the head of the pet's grave. It can also be propped up using a large pebble or a small log behind it.

Avoid reinforcing new behaviors.,
Be patient.,
Seek veterinary help.",How to Help a Pet Grieve2," Your pet may experience some behavioral changes during their mourning process, such as pickier eating or barking or whining more. While it can sometimes be difficult, it is important to not reinforce these changes. Instead, help gently encourage your pet to return to their regular behavior.This may mean not switching out their food even if they are not eating as much, or simply not acknowledging or indulging in begging or other negative behavior.
If your pet is regularly making noise or whining, develop a command such as ""quiet"" to let your pet know when that behavior is inappropriate. Do not yell the command, but deliver it in a stern tone, and offer your pet positive reinforcement when they obey.

, It can be difficult to see an animal grieve, but just like with people they will need some time to process their emotions. Be patient with your animal if they do not seem to have as much joy or energy for a few weeks or even months. Stick to their routine, and allow them time to adjust.There is no set timeframe for how long a pet should grieve. If you are concerned that your pet is not improving, you may want to ask your vet for advice.
While your pet is grieving, provide it with plenty of love and support. Spend time grooming your pet, playing with them, and petting, cuddling, or simply sitting near them. Show them that you are there for them in their time of need.

, If your pet has become extremely lethargic, will not eat or drink, or exhibits overly aggressive or dangerous behaviors, consult your vet immediately. They may be able to recommend some practices to help your pet, from behavioral training to medication, if necessary.


Let your vet know that your animal has recently experienced a loss and how their behavior has changed since then.For example, if your animal has stopped eating all together, let your vet know, ""My pet and I recently lost another pet in the family, and since then this pet has refused to eat any of their normal food.""

Wait until you are ready.,
Allow your pets to meet.,
Pay attention to your current pet.",How to Help a Pet Grieve3," If you and your pet are mourning the loss of another animal, one way to help heal is to bring home a new friend. Wait until you feel emotionally prepared, though. If you do not feel like you are in a place to properly love or care for a new pet, wait until you feel you can best provide for it.Only you know when you are ready for a new pet. Allow yourself enough time so that you feel excited to welcome a new life into your home, rather than simply feeling like you need to fill a void.

, Make sure your pet is ready for a new companion by allowing your animal and any potential new pet to meet before you commit. This can point out an behavioral problems that either pet may have,as well as give you a sense of how comfortable your current pet is with a new pet.If you are working with an animal shelter, many require pets to meet prior to adoption. Let the shelter know that you have a pet already, and that you would like to schedule a meeting between your pets to see how they get along.
If you are working with a reputable, ethical breeder, ask them about setting up a meeting between your pet and the new animal prior to pick up day.

, A new pet, especially a young one such as a puppy or kitten, is going to require a great amount of attention to train and introduce to the home. Make sure to schedule time to play with and care for your current pet.Try to make sure you have some time each day dedicated just to your grieving pet. Take time to participate in an activity such as making physical contact or playing that your pet enjoys without the company of the new pet.
Be sure to also schedule time for your grieving pet and your new pet to interact. They may or may not be welcoming to one another at first, but you should encourage a positive relationship by walking them together or setting up times to play with both of them at the same time.

Be observant of your horse’s behavior.,
Keep your horse wormed.,
Have your horse’s teeth floated.",How to Walk a Colicking Horse," The first thing you should do when you notice your horse is colicking is call your veterinarian. This is because there are many potential reasons your horse could be colicking, some of which are very serious. You might have years of experience with horses, but a colicking horse is something that needs to be examined by a trained veterinarian.Your veterinarian may give you instructions on what to do, they may come to your horse’s location, or they may ask you to bring the horse to the vet's stable to be looked at.;
, One of the potential causes of colic is called impaction. This is when some food gets stuck somewhere in the large intestine, which halts the normal digestive process causing pain. The logic behind walking a colicking horse assumes that walking them will help get the digestive process flowing again. However, since “colic” simply refers to abdominal pain, walking a colicking horse may not be the best solution.Understand that many veterinarians have said that walking a horse to help with colic is a myth, and while it may not hurt them to walk, it is definitely not a solution all on its own. If you want to walk your horse while you wait for the veterinarian to arrive, then go ahead and do so.
On the other hand, if your horse seems to be lying rather comfortably, some veterinarians will say that it is best to leave them be. Use your best judgment, if walking seems to distract the horse from their pain, then it may be helpful., In order to walk your horse, you’ll need to put a lead on. If your horse is laying down, put the lead on and then use it to help the horse understand that you want it to get up. In some cases, a horse that is in pain may be aggressive or thrash around. Don’t try to approach the horse if this is the case.


If your horse is in a lot of pain, they may ignore your attempts to get them up. Don’t force the matter, and let the horse be.

, You can walk the horse around the pasture or open space that you have for ten to twenty minutes.You don’t need to do anything more than simply keep the horse moving. Limit the walking to twenty minutes, as walking the horse for a long time will only exhaust an already stressed horse.Some people recommend trying to get the horse into a trot. You can try this if you want to, but this may be even more painful for the horse because of all the jostling that occurs when a horse trots.
If it makes you feel better, you can talk to your horse while you are walking. Keep your voice low and use gentle tones. This may help both you and the horse relax a bit.

, One way to get an idea of what is going on inside your horse’s stomach is to listen with a stethoscope, if you have one. If your horse’s stomach is functioning normally, you should hear gurgling noises that indicate that food is being digested and passing through the digestive system normally.If your horse is giving you a reason to think they are colicking, then you should contact your veterinarian whether or not you hear stomach sounds. If you hear stomach sounds and your horse is in pain anyways, then there may be something else going on.
If you don’t have a stethoscope, you may be able to press your ear against the horse’s belly and see what you can hear.

, Another common belief of many horse owners is that you should never allow a colicking horse to roll. The reasoning behind this belief is that if a colicking horse rolls, their intestines might get twisted, which is very dangerous for the horse. However, this is actually false. A horse that is rolling because of colic is simply trying to make itself more comfortable. If they have a twisted intestine, then this has happened before they rolled, not as a result of it.A twisted intestine may occur in horses because of their anatomy and is a very serious matter. A horse with a twisted intestine will require immediate surgical intervention., Though it is unlikely that a colicking horse will eat anything anyway, you should remove the feed until well after the horse’s colic has passed and the cause of the colic has been determined.You should, however, make sure that your horse has access to clean water. If your horse drinks, that is fine, but try to make sure they aren’t drinking a lot of water all at once.

, In horses, the term colic doesn’t necessarily refer to a specific ailment; instead, it refers to pain in the abdomen.This is why it is important to contact a veterinarian. Unless you know the cause of the pain, you won’t be able to help the horse.


Some reasons a horse may colic are not particularly serious in that they are typically not life-threatening, but some causes can be very dangerous for your horse.

, There are many reasons that a horse might colic. Sometimes the cause for colic will not be a big deal, but other times the cause may be very serious, and the horse may require surgery. This is why it is very important to treat all cases of colic as serious until you can have the cause determined by a veterinarian.Impaction colic occurs when food gets stuck somewhere in the intestinal track, usually in the large intestine. The food builds up behind that causing pain and discomfort. This is one of the most common causes for colic, and typically be treated fairly easily. However, be aware that this type of colic can also indicate more serious problems.
Gas colic occurs when gas builds up inside the intestinal tract causing the intestine to stretch, which then causes pain. Though it is not clear exactly why this occurs in some horses, it can usually be treated easily.
Displacement, volvulus, torsion (also sometimes simply called a twisted gut) all refer to a case of colic in which some part of the digestive system has moved abnormally. In most cases, this cause requires surgery as soon as possible. If this treatment is not received the horse will often have to be put down. The early symptoms of this cause look similar to a less severe case of colic and demonstrate why it is extremely important to have a veterinarian take a look regardless of what you think the cause might be.
When the small or large intestines become inflamed it is referred to enteritis or colitis, respectively. The inflammation may be caused by an infection. This is another serious case of colic and should be treated by a veterinarian.
Gastric distension occurs when a horse eats more than they should. It is important to understand that horses have relatively small stomachs. This is because, in their natural habitat, they would eat slowly throughout the day, rather than eat big meals. If a horse gets into something such as grain or pellets and gorges on it, this can cause their stomach to swell, which causes pain. Horses are not able to vomit, so this is a very serious problem. In some cases, the stomach may rupture (and is called gastric rupture). If this occurs the horse will die.
Sometimes the reason a horse colics cannot be determined. In these cases, you and your veterinarian will likely monitor the situation carefully to treat the horse based on the symptoms that occur.

, Because colic can occur seemingly out of nowhere, it is important to always be looking for signs that your horse may have colic. Learn the symptoms to check for, and keep an eye out for them every time you go out to care for your horse.The symptoms to look for include:


Lying down. It is, of course, not unusual for a horse to lay down, but some horses lay down less than others. If you notice your horse lying down more than usual, there may be a problem.
Relatedly, if your horse is lying down and then getting back up often, there may be a problem. They may be trying to make themselves more comfortable.
Standing in a stretched out position. If your horse is having stomach pain, they may stand with their front and back legs stretched out to try and make their stomach feel better.
Rolling. As with most of the symptoms, your horse may roll around on the ground to try and make themselves feel more comfortable. However, horses also roll simply because it feels good so rolling in and of itself does not necessarily indicate a problem.
If your horse is in pain they may kick at their abdomen or try to bite their abdomen.
A horse that is in pain may also paw the ground in frustration, or they may repeatedly curl the lips.

, Horses who don’t have continual access to water are more likely to colic.Thus, you should keep a bucket of fresh water available to them at all times. Horses cannot digest large quantities of water all at once, so they will likely take small drinks of water throughout the day.


During the colder months, add hot water once or twice a day to help keep the water from freezing. Horses are also more likely to drink the water if it is a bit warm when it is cold outside.

, Horses that have daily access to a pasture are less likely to colic. This could be because horses in a pasture have access to fresh sources of food.Additionally, when horses are in a pasture they are more likely to graze slowly, which makes it easier for their digestive system to handle.


In addition to that, you should limit the amount of grain and pellets your horse eats. Be conscientious about how much grain/pellets you are feeding as these tend to increase the risk of colic.

, Animals are very sensitive when it comes to changes. Thus, you should observe your horse carefully in the weeks that follow a change in their feed, their housing, any other animals that are around them, weather, etc. Your horse may be more likely to colic during these times.When changing a horse’s feed do not change it all at once. It is best to slowly introduce the new feed in with the old feed. For example, start out by mixing 1/4 of the new feed in with 3/4 of the old feed for the first seven days of feeding. After that, continue to increase the amount of new feed gradually to help prevent colic.

, One of the reasons a horse might colic is if they manage to eat more grain than they should. Something like this might occur if, for example, a horse finds a way into the grain barrel without the owner noticing. If a horse eats too much grain, they are likely to colic, and they will also be at greater risk for a painful disease called laminitis. Thus, it if you suspect your horse has overeaten, you should contact your vet as they may want to take action that could prevent colic.If your horse has eaten a large amount of grain your horse could potentially die so you should not take this situation lightly.
To prevent this possibility, it is best to make sure there is no possibility that your horse could get into a grain barrel. One way to do this is to use barrels with sealable lids or to keep the grain in a locked room that the horse couldn’t possibly access.

, As a horse owner, it is important to be very observant of your horse’s behavior. Besides colic, there is a host of potential illnesses and diseases that could affect your horse, so it is important to be vigilant in your horse’s care. Keep an eye on all of your horse’s habits so that you will be more likely to notice when something is not right with them.For example, take a look at how much water they drink on a daily basis, how often they defecate and how much, how quickly they eat, how active they are, how they behave with other horses, etc. Horses are complex animals so any change in their normal behavior might be an indication that something is wrong.

, Another common cause of colic is intestinal worms that can severely disrupt your horse’s digestive process. If you aren’t sure how to worm your horse, ask your veterinarian to show you how to do it so that you can do it on your own at home.The dosage will be based on your horse’s weight, so have your horse’s weight checked to make sure you are giving the right amount.
Typically, a horse should be wormed every six to eight weeks; however, your veterinarian may suggest a different schedule.

, Horse’s teeth are different from human teeth because they “erupt,” which basically just means that in a sense, they grow, albeit very slowly. As they erupt, they also tend to get worn down as the horse eats, which is good. The problem is that the teeth can wear unevenly, which can make it difficult for a horse to chew their food properly. Food that is not chewed well is more likely to get caught up in their stomach, resulting in colic; thus, it is important to make sure that your horse’s teeth are floated when they start to get uneven.Floating a horse’s teeth means that they are ground down so that they sit evenly on top of each other.
There are differing ideas about how often a horse’s teeth should be floated. Some say every 6 months, some say once per year, while others say that a horse’s teeth should only be floated when necessary. Talk to your veterinarian about the subject, and they will be able to give you their own opinions on the topic.

Understand how she might be feeling if the pet was euthanized.",How to Comfort a Grieving Pet Owner," In any process of grieving, the most important thing is for the bereaved person to have an opportunity to share her feelings. Your friend should feel free to talk to you without being judged or given unwanted advice.

Let her take the lead, but give her plenty of opportunities by checking in on her frequently, inviting her over for dinner, going for a walk together, or getting coffee. Don't force talking about the deceased pet, but if she seems to want to talk about the pet, let her know you will not get tired of listening.
Be prepared for the unexpected. Some people grieve by not talking about their loss at all; other people repeat the details of the pet's death over and over in extreme detail. You might think you know how your friend will respond to death, but you may end up surprised. Similarly, your friend might grieve silently one day and then weep all day the next.Try not to compare your friend's loss to anything in your own life, or to make their sorrow about you by talking about your own troubles. If you don’t know what to say when someone is grieving, often just saying that you love your friend and will support her through this time is enough.;
, Sometimes people who lose a pet feel a very deep sense of loss as if they had lost a child. They might want to talk about the pet all the time. Follow your friend's lead; if she wants to talk about her pet's life, be prepared with stories and memorabilia.


Bring over photos or other mementos of the pet.
Share a post on social media about how much the pet meant to you so that your friend will see your support. Include a photo or a funny story if you have one.

, Your friend is experiencing the loss of a partner and friend and may not be able to do her errands, chores, or other daily necessities without breaking down in tears. Ask her what she needs you to do to support her.Also keep in mind that many people experiencing intense grief will not be able to articulate their own needs; their minds are often preoccupied with loss and sadness. Think about your friend's daily life and fill the needs you can. Bring her coffee, bring in her mail or newspaper, offer to do her laundry or housekeeping, offer to pick up her kids from school; anticipate her needs if you can.

, A meal is a classic way to support anyone who is going through a hard time or grieving. Find out what your friend likes to eat and bring something healthy and comforting.


Casseroles and other one-pot meals are often a great choice because your friend can freeze half of it for later. In fact, you might prepare extra and freeze a portion for her.

, If your friend's grief seems overwhelming or you don't know how to help, locate professionals or services in your area that can support her. It is important that you don't force these types of services on your friend, who might not want to utilize them; instead, just find the applicable numbers or meeting times and leave them with her.


Increasingly, community centers, libraries, and churches offer support groups for pet bereavement; you can search online to see if there is one near you. Some veterinarians even offer grief counseling.Offer to attend with your friend to give your support.
There are also therapists and psychologists who specialize in bereavement and pet loss, especially for companion animals.

, Remember that grief is an unpredictable process, but she will always miss her pet even if she seems fine. Keep checking in on her and spending time with her over the long haul; that's just what good friends do.


Consider marking on your calendar the pet's birthday and day of death, so that you can be prepared to offer extra support when those anniversaries come around., It is a classic and beautiful way to tell someone that she is on your mind and that you are aware of her grief. Sometimes just having grief acknowledged can be helpful.


Let her know you are thinking of her. A simple card that says ""I'm thinking of you and (pet's name) today"" is enough. Don't offer empty platitudes like ""The pet is in a better place,"" or ""You will feel better soon.""Some flower delivery services offer special bouquets in memory of a lost pet. Check to see what is available from your favorite florist.

, Depending on your budget or artistic skills, there are several ways you can create a small memorial for the beloved pet, which will show your friend that you care and that the pet will not be forgotten.


If you are artistic, consider painting a portrait of the pet. You can also commission paintings of pets for reasonable prices on websites like Etsy or from local artists.
You could also consider making or purchasing a dog memorial stone for your friend's garden. These are available for purchase at pet stores and online, and often come engraved with the pet's name and dates of birth and death.

, Think of a random act of kindness or a gift to a charity that would mean a lot to your particular friend or her pet. This is a great way to ensure that the pet's legacy continues to make an impact even after death.


For example, if her pet loved children, you might make a donation or spend time volunteering with an organization that trains therapy dogs for children. Or maybe she had a favorite park where she loved to bring the dog; consider donating to the park to build a bench or dog run, planting a tree, or spending time volunteering at the park to pick up trash.
Send a card or letter to your friend and include a beautiful, handwritten note explaining what you did in the dog's honor.
You can also make a donation in the pet's name to your local humane society., It can be hard to understand what your friend is going through, especially if you do not have pets yourself. But psychologists have identified several key roles that pets often play in the lives of their owners, especially companion pets like cats and dogs:


Pets can fill the same psychological role as a sibling, partner, or child.While that might seem extreme, any pet lover can tell you that the human-animal bond is deep. Losing a pet is very similar in many ways to losing a loved one of the human variety.

, Besides emotional and social benefits of owning a pet, scientists have found that pet owners often experience health benefits as well, including lowered blood pressure, lower levels of anxiety, and lower cholesterol.Owning companion pets can reduce rates of depression and increase seratonin and dopamine levels, which increase feelings of calm and happiness. In persons with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, owning a pet can reduce symptoms such as aggression and anxiety.If your friend was accustomed to regularly walking her dog, she may now be getting considerably less exercise.It should be no surprise that the death of a pet may precede health problems for a bereaved owner, likely because there is no longer a pet to help comfort and relieve stress.
Help your friend to find other ways to relieve stress in her life and stay active, such as going for a walk, taking up yoga, joining a book club, or finding a creative outlet like painting or music. Since your friend is already feeling lonesome because of the loss of her pet, offer to attend classes or otherwise partake of these stress-relieving activities with her.

, Just as with the death of a loved one, the death of a pet often causes an intense grief cycle that never really resolves. Don't expect your friend to just stop talking about her pet or to just ""get over"" her loss as if her pet were a possession and not a friend. Instead, recognize that grief is a process that often takes months or years, and doesn't end in resolution but rather in coping with the loss.Grief is a very personal process that is different for everyone. There is no timetable for your friend's grief.Your friend may even feel embarrassed or ashamed to talk about her loss with others, because many people do not understand the psychological intensity of pet bereavement. She may fear that you will think she is overreacting or that she should not grieve so intensely., While it is common for caring friends and well-meaning family to try to pressure someone to replace a dearly loved pet quickly, your friend will know when the time is right to adopt another pet.


Keep in mind that she may decide never to adopt another pet. Her beloved pet cannot be replaced, after all, any more than a child could be replaced.If your friend is a senior living by herself, a new pet might be a good idea to provide companionship and a sense of purpose. Still, it is your friend's decision to make, and should not be forced on her., People who have to euthanize sick or severely injured pets often experience intense feelings of guilt and shame over the decision, even if there was no other choice.

Try not to talk about the euthanasia decision or process unless she does. In that situation, let her know that she made a loving, difficult choice and that it was the right thing to do. Assure her, if she asks or seems concerned, that the euthanasia process itself is closely monitored to ensure that it is humane, fast, and painless for the pet, who simply falls asleep."

Narrow the choices.,
Have fun!",How to Pick Riding Lessons," It is easy to get carried away in the world of riding. But it's important that you know how much you can handle, and afford. Making a limit to how much money you spend is always helpful. Then when your ready to pick, you can narrow down the choices so it won't be as difficult. Plus, you won't spend everything you have in your wallet. If you sign up for lessons that you can't pay for, it could be dangerous.;
, It is important you find good riding schools that are close by. If you sign up for something far away, you will most-likely get there late. It would make everything complicated, and you could end up holding your whole group back because of the timing.

, In some barns, it is no longer about the horse, but the rider and the ribbons won. It is not always easy to tell what company wants what. So its important to do your research. In the end you will have to decide what it is you want the barn focused on, the ribbons, or the horse?

, Now that you know what is important to you, look into riding schools. Visit websites, call, and explore each barn in your area. Everyone will run things differently, so don't judge them because they don't do something others do. You don't have to rate them, don't have to keep a score sheet, you just have to enjoy the ride.

, Now that you have explored barns, you need to nock all but one out. Pick the one that you like the best, the one that feels welcoming. With all the choices, it will be challenging to pick just one. But in the end, you'll have to. If you're not sure about which one to keep, and which ones not to, take a trail ride or observe a class, to see what it would really be like to be a member.

, It will be hard getting used to your new lessons, but someday you will fit in, and get used to it. Good luck, and have fun riding!

Make sure you wear a helmet. Your instructor can likely provide one for you during your lessons.Avoid wearing pants that bunch up too much at the knee, and avoid wearing a shirt that is too loose or large and might risk getting caught on something.
If it’s summer time, you might be tempted to wear shorts, but don’t do this! Pants protect your legs from rubbing against the saddle and being uncomfortable while riding.
Leave your cell phone and other electronic devices at home. In the event that your phone falls out of your pocket, it might be likely to break or be damaged. Also, sudden noises like notifications or ringtones could spook the horses or disturb other riders.;
, Any time you aren’t sure about an instruction, speak up and ask questions. Your instructor is there to help you learn, and you should treat him or her like any other teacher and ask for clarification when you need it.If your instructor seems impatient with you, or even becomes irritable or rude, you may have chosen the wrong instructor. You want to be sure you are comfortable with speaking up and asking questions. Make sure you are getting the most out of your lessons. If you feel like the instructor you chose is not the one for you, you can always choose a different one.

, Since this is your first lesson, you might spend a good amount of time on the ground rather than on the horse. You instructor will likely focus on teaching the basics for safety and handling, so it is absolutely important that you listen and abide by what your instructor says.Your instructor will likely start by showing you how to approach the horse, how to tack up, and how to mount. Through the first few lessons, your instructor might keep your horse on a lunge, or long lead, for your safety.

, If you don’t get everything on the first try, don’t be discouraged! Just like any other sport or skill, horseback riding will take practice and time to learn. Even if certain things might seem difficult at first, you will get better at them if you keep working at it.


Trust your instructor’s judgement if they decide to keep you on the ground for the entire first lesson. Safety and handling are important aspects of horseback riding, and your instructor will want you to feel prepared and confident when you get on the horse.

, Avoid coming towards a horse from behind, as you might spook him. Approach from the front, and off to the left side a bit, making sure you are in his line of sight. He will see you coming and not be startled as you come up.If you must approach from behind, make sure to let the horse know you’re there by talking to him softly, and gently running your hand over his hind quarters. Run your hand gently along his body as you move towards his head.

, Don’t make any sudden or jerking movements. Since this is likely your first time around this horse, you need to give him some time to get used to you being around, and learn to trust you.Taking some time to pet the horse and letting him get to know your voice and your scent can be helpful when first meeting him and getting acquainted with him. Take your time getting comfortable; if you’re nervous, the horse is more likely to be nervous as well.
Stick to petting the horse’s neck, under his jaw, and behind his ears. Be careful not to get your hands too close to his eyes or mouth, especially when he is still unfamiliar with you.

, He or she may let you assist, and teach you the steps for saddling and getting the horse ready to ride. Make sure you listen to your instructor’s directions, and pay careful attention to what they are teaching you, as they might have you do it on your own after a few lessons.


Your instructor might also allow you to groom the horse prior to tacking up. Grooming before riding might include brushing the horse out and combing out his mane and tail. After a few lessons, your instructor may also teach you how to pick a horse’s hooves. Always do these things with caution, and stay alert around the horse., If you are brand new to horseback riding and want to take lessons for the very first time, or even if you may have tried riding years ago and would like to get back into it, knowing what your goals and expectations are when taking lessons is an important first step.Some instructors might cater towards children rather than adults, so if you are looking for an instructor for your child, or you are an adult wanting to take on or return to the sport, this will factor into your choice.
Understanding your own goals and objectives for lessons before beginning them will also help you better communicate these things to your instructor when you start, and help them be better able to get you to those goals.

, You will want to determine how far you’re willing to travel to take lessons, so you can determine which instructors are within that distance. You can do an internet search, or try looking in the yellow pages of a phone book.


If you live close to a few stables or boarding facilities, you can stop by and ask them if they offer lessons, or know anyone that does and that they might recommend. You can also stop by your local tack shop and see if anyone has posted fliers there for lessons, or if any of the employees know of any good instructors.

, This will help you narrow down your list of potential instructors once you find out what their rates are, and how often they offer lessons.Some established instructors might offer packages that lower the overall cost for lessons. Find out what kind of packages the instructors on your list offer, and compare prices.
Make sure you know how long each lesson will be before you commit to anything. If one instructor charges the same price as another, but for a shorter lesson, you won’t be getting as much instruction for your money.

, Find out how long each potential instructor has been giving lessons, and whether they specialize in certain aspects of riding, like dressage or jumping. Make sure their level of experience is satisfactory for you.


Organizations like The American Riding Instructors Association provide databases of instructors certified through their test and evaluation processes. You can try using these to find qualified and experienced instructors.Look for instructors that have insurance. Horseback riding is a physical, hands-on sport, so you want to make sure your instructor is covered in the event of an accident or injury. Ask instructors the name of their insurance company and check that their policy is up to date and active., In order to pick the best instructor, you will want to meet with them and visit the riding facility itself. Make sure the barn is a safe place, and that all instructors and riders are behaving in a safe manner.Taking the time to meet with potential instructors can help you decide how well you work with each one. You want an instructor that is friendly, professional, and informative. You want them to feel trustworthy, and like someone you could learn from.
The stable or riding facility should be clean and well-kept. The horses should appear to be in good condition, and all equipment and stalls should appear to be well-maintained and taken care of.

, The students any instructor already has will be a great source of feedback on that particular instructor. Sit in on a lesson and see if the student(s) seem to be enjoying themselves, and evaluate how the instructor interacts with his or her students.Some instructors may have reviews through the Better Business Bureau, so you can check their website and search for that instructor. Alternatively, there may be online reviews for the instructor elsewhere on the web. Take any online reviews with a grain of salt, though; the best way to make a good judgement is to see for yourself through a visit and watching a lesson.

, You will likely need to provide your own riding clothes, helmet, and boots. Don’t invest in tack such as saddles or bridles, especially if you don’t actually own a horse yourself. Your instructor and/or the riding facility should provide all tack.


Don’t invest too much money into your riding clothes until you are certain that you will want to keep up with taking lessons. Buy one outfit to start with, and wash it between lessons. After a few weeks, if you still want to keep taking lessons, you can feel secure in buying more riding clothes.

, It might seem like most people who ride horses in the movies just wear cowboy hats or nothing at all on their heads, but safety is very important when pursuing horseback riding. Make sure you purchase a helmet, or borrow one from your instructor until you are ready to purchase one.Be sure your helmet fits properly. The strap should be snug under your chin, but still comfortable. Don’t use a bicycle helmet for horseback riding, as these helmets are designed to protect from different kinds of injuries than a proper horseback riding helmet.

, Do a quick online search to find one near to you, or ask your instructor where they recommend you go. Tack shops aren’t as common as run-of-the-mill sporting goods stores, as they are technically considered specialty shops.


TackShops.us is a great source for tack shops in your state. Just pick your state from the list, and scroll through to find one near you. Call the shop before you go to make sure they have what you need, and that they are open.

, The internet is a great source for horseback riding equipment. You may be able to find many things at a lower price online than in a store. There are a number of reputable online outlets and catalogues that you can purchase your equipment from.


StateLineTack.com is a well-known online outlet for all things related to horseback riding, from tack to clothing and boots. A quick internet search will likely yield a great number of other options as well.

Prepare your horse.",How to Prepare for Your First Horse Riding Lesson," Plan to show up ten or twenty minutes early so that you can make sure you're in the right place, meet your trainer, and introduce yourself to your horse before you get on. Planning a time buffer will also help you avoid being late if you get lost on the way there.;
, Print out a map or directions to the barn where your lesson will take place. If it's a large barn or complex, ask ahead of time about where you should park and where you can find your instructor once you arrive. Confirm the address and directions with your instructor over phone or email before the day of your first lesson.

, This is the most important part of your riding outfit. Shorts will expose your bare legs to chafing, pinching, or scratching on the straps and buckles of the saddle, and dresses or skirts won't allow you adequate protection and freedom of movement. If you have jodhpurs or specialized riding pants, wear those. If you don't, there's no need to get them for your first lesson. Jeans or any other protective pants will do, as long as they're not so tight that you can't move your legs. Avoid play suits or jumpsuits.

, Since it's your first lesson, you'll want to present yourself well, so wear a clean and tasteful shirt rather than one covered with holes or stains. However, riding is a form of exercise and horses are inherently dirty, so don't wear your favorite shirt if you don't want to see it stained and dirty by the end of your lesson.

, Riding boots, either English or Western in style, are by far the best shoes to wear around horses. However, if you're not sure you're going to stick with riding, you may want to wait before making this purchase. Any close-toed shoes with a slight heel will work for your first lesson. If you don't have shoes with an appropriate heel, tennis shoes or hiking boots will suffice, and discuss getting better shoes with your instructor.

, A helmet is an absolutely crucial part of your riding costume; it will protect you in the case of a fall, and it could even save your life. Never ride without a helmet. If you have your own riding helmet, bring it to your lesson. If you don't have your own, don't worry; most barns have plenty of helmets to offer you for your first lessons. Confirm with your instructor before the lesson that they can provide a helmet, and arrive in time to find one that fits before getting on your horse.


Don't wear a helmet designed for a different activity, such as a bike helmet, as these protect different parts of your head and are optimized for different things. Wear a helmet designed for horseback riding, and choose one for your specific discipline - dressage, cross country, and polo all have different safety standards - if possible.

, You'll want your hair out of your face so that it doesn't get in the way. Tie it back in a low ponytail, or French braid it for a more secure, effective hairdo. This will keep it out of your face while still allowing your helmet to sit comfortably on your head. Cover your hair with a hairnet.

, Fitted gloves will protect your hands and fingers from chafing and blisters, and half chaps will keep your lower legs safe from getting caught in the stirrup leathers as you ride. However, these and similar riding accessories are not necessary, and as they can be quite expensive, it's usually a good idea to buy them only once you're sure you're going to continue riding.

, For your first lesson, your instructor will likely do this for you or be ready to walk you through the steps of brushing and tacking up your horse. Clarify this with your instructor before the day of your lesson so that you'll know exactly what you will be held responsible for. If you need to prepare your horse, curry comb and brush it, pick its hooves, and saddle and bridle it. Ask your instructor to check your work before you get on to make sure that everything is safe and comfortable for both you and your horse.

See if the centre provide hats.,
Check whether the riding centre provides riding crops or if you need to buy your child one.,
Choose Riding Boots.",How to Get a Child Horse Riding Lessons," Does your child actually want horse riding lessons? is a very important question to ask yourself, because some people who have always ridden from a young age may want to force their own children into horse riding when they do not actually want to ride so to stop you wasting your money on something your child would rather not do ask them first.;
, Find some which are at a fairly cheap price, if cheap is what you think is best. Take some time to decide which would be best. You can get a half hour group lesson for £9 or equivalent maybe but $18 for a 1 hour lesson is better. Also you have to bear in mind the price of private lessons as well.

, Ask them if they'd prefer to have riding lessons with other children or on their own. They will enjoy their lessons more if they are actually on the type of riding lessons they actually want. A child who would like to do private lessons will not be very happy if they have to do group lessons instead.

, If your child has never ridden before they will need to be on a lead rein lesson until their horse riding instructor decides they are ok to move up to a beginner lesson where they are not on a lead rein.

, When you have somewhere in mind for your child to ride, visit and watch the lead round/rein lesson you are going to be on. If you think it looks fine go ahead and book your child's lessons.

, Have a look that all the horses look happy, healthy, alert, clean and well fed.

, If the centre provides hats you should use them while your child is still on the lead rein lesson and probably nervous as if they fall off they will most likely want to quit riding.

, Also you need to find out if you have to buy your child jodhpurs, body protector etc. or if while they are still on the lead rein lesson if they can manage in normal trousers and no body protector and no gloves or normal gloves.

, Make sure your child has riding boots, they are a must or your child's foot may get stuck in the stirrup particularly when they fall off (every rider will fall off at some time).

Slow down again.",How to Warm up a Horse in the Ring," Pick up any large, or even small, sticks and rocks, and throw them over the fence. Even a relatively tiny stone, when jabbed into the soft spot of a horse's hoof, can seriously cripple the horse for the rest of its life. Make sure this doesn't happen, and that the entire ring is free of holes and obstructions. If you do find a hole that you think could potentially cause harm to your horse, fill it immediately, and make sure the fill dirt is solid. Even if it looks filled, if the dirt is too loose, your horse could still stumble. If at a Horse Show, inform the Steward or Judge in nearby rings, or the Show Manager that there is a hole or some large rocks, it is there responsibility to remove them not yours. Simply ride around them.;
, This includes all jumps, barrels, and anything else you may need. If you are setting up simple jumps, always remember to use relatively flexible material, such as plastic PCB pipe, on a very loose hold. This is to assure that, if your horse nicks the jump with its hoof, the jump will give way and not cause any harm to the horse. If you want a more solid and official-looking jump, Build a Horse Jump may be of some use to you. If at a show, this is not required, but having a second person with you to pick up a fallen jump or falling cone, so other riders can continue to warm up without too much hassle.

, Groom, bridle, and saddle your horse before venturing into the ring. This will save time and will make it easier to watch your horse while walking to the ring and make sure all tack is on properly.

, You can do this by riding atop your horse, or just leading them by their reins. If there are other horses nearby that may end up being problems to your horse while getting to the ring, walk beside your horse, keeping a strong hand on the reins. (Or lead rope.) If the other horses do end up causing problems, or your horse bolts, you can easily get away without the risk of falling off a running horse.

, If the horse is of a hot-blooded variety, small changes can make it anxious and inattentive. You want to avoid this; let your horse roam around the ring at its leisure for a few minutes, so that it can get used to the area. This can also help for if you may have missed a small hole or two- give your horse time to examine the ground itself.

, If you don't have a lunge line, or your horse is not yet accustomed to the lunge line, just mount and begin riding slowly.

,, Walk your horse around the ring at a slow, easy pace. Walk around, or over the lower, jumps at this pace. Attempting to jump them while walking so slow is not only difficult to clear, it is also frustrating to the horse. If you are preparing for barrel races, go around the individual barrels, and make your horse accustomed to the ground around the barrels, as well as the barrels themselves. Pay close attention to if the horse's gait breaks or if you feel anything sliding irregularly. If either happens, dismount and figure out the problem. The horse may have a pebble in its hoof; remove, and remount.


While walking, go in different directions, an equal amount of time for each direction. This will make it so that the horse will not think that, when going one way, you expect one specific thing, and then when going another way, will expect another. This also assists with balance.
Also try going in different shapes. Serpentine shapes, just going back and forth in wavy lines, and small circles are recommended, as well as doing the large circle of the riding ring.
Try different speeds of walking. Many horses try to keep one constant speed while walking, but this is not good. Try convincing your horse to do slower and faster walking paces without going into a completely different gait. This assists with delicate signals between you and your horse.
Finally, before moving on to faster gaits, try making your horse back up. There are many ways of doing this, try to find the best way for your individual horse. If your horse is more anxious to go faster, it is also a good idea to try to practice halting, no matter how basic it may seem. If you are going to compete in a show, a large portion of your time will be spent waiting at a halt; if your horse cannot stay still, you will have problems, so you should work on this.

, Move up to a trot after a bit of time, maybe ten minutes or so, of just simple walking in the ring. After this, and you're sure that the horse has no problems gait-wise, move up to a canter and, if your ring is large enough, an eventual gallop. Once you've gotten up to a medium trot, then start attempting to jump the smaller jumps. Only try the larger jumps once your horse has gained up enough momentum for you to feel confident in the horse.

, Slowly start to go back down to a canter, then a trot, and then finally a walk. At this point, you should feel confident that the horse has been warmed up enough to do the real work, and can leave the ring.

Have fun teaching!",How to Teach Someone to Ride a Horse," Your student can be anyone from a curious friend to a failing rider at your stable. Don't be shy; they'll appreciate help! However, don't pester people who don't want to ride. If you do this, you'll only annoy them.;
, After the lesson, you can chat with the teacher - (s)he probably won't mind sharing a few tips!

, Require your student to always wear an appropriate riding helmet, and teach basic horse safety before starting on riding. Remember to choose a slow, sane horse for a beginner - even if your student loves him, your ex-racehorse Thoroughbred is hardly a good fit!

, Show him/her how to groom, lead, and tack up a horse. Include information on horses' history, breeds, and behavior; the names and purposes of tack; appropriate clothing for riding; and various other basic information.

, Always begin by teaching your student how to safely mount and dismount and how to stop before teaching him/her how to ride. It's best that on your student's first tries you put a halter over the horse's bridle and lead him to give the student a sense of security while (s)he learns how to walk, trot, whoa, turn around, etc. Remember, however, to push your student towards riding independently once the basics are covered - don't allow comforting actions such as holding onto the horse's mane or riding while the horse is being led by another person to become habits.

, Though this isn't advisable on the first lessons, and on other occasions on which you might need to lead the horse, it can be helpful while teaching correct posture, rein grip, etc. Whenever riding while teaching, make sure to ride a quiet horse that won't spook and alarm your student's horse.

, Exercises such as ""Around the World"" and riding without stirrups are fun for the student and can help improve his/her riding. Whenever your student is doing exercises like these, however, it's important to keep the horse under control by attaching him to a lunge line, or putting a halter over his bridle and leading him. If your student has an issue you want to address or there's a skill you want to teach him, you can even make up your own exercises.

, Your student will enjoy the lessons more, and praising your student when (s)he does something right is much more effective than criticizing him when (s)he does something wrong. For more on teaching using praise, read Karen Pryor's book Don't Shoot the Dog.

, An upbeat teacher enjoying him/herself is going to be much more successful with teaching than a grouchy one. Just have fun teaching, interacting with horses, and feeling the sense of accomplishment you gain when you watch your student proudly riding!

Think about what level of instruction you're looking for, before you start.,
Ride around.,
Make sure the barn is clean and organized.,
Watch another lesson.,
Visit the farm's website (if available).",How to Find a Good Riding Instructor," Some people just want a trainer for a weekly lesson, while some like anywhere from two to four lessons per week. This will help you narrow down your search, although most trainers have plenty of once-a-weekers, and competitive riders, too. You should also think about what kind of money you're willing to spend. More well-known trainers usually charge more, but a less-known trainer will charge a good deal less. Think about how far you're willing to travel, and maybe, if you keep your horse at your place, if you'd like the instructor to come to you.;
, Check with your horsey friends to see where they ride, and the other barns in the area, if you don't already know. Once you know this, you can call up and set up a lesson. Sometimes, even if you have your own horse already, you can usually ride a lesson horse. You'll see how much effort they put into the lesson program. Visit every barn in your area.

, A dirty, unorganized barn is a recipe for disaster!

, Sometimes, you can gain more from watching than from actually taking a lesson. But be sure to call and schedule a time in advance!

, Many farms put up lots of information about lesson rates, what they do, and information about the farm as well as pictures of horses and students.

Understand why posting is done.,
Understand diagonals.,
Realize that posting should be done using your thigh muscles, not your legs.,
Gather the reins so you're in contact with the horse's mouth.,
Post forward and up simultaneously, then down and back.,
Change your diagonal when you change rein.,
Avoid sitting too heavily.,
Ensure your legs are positioned correctly.,
Keep your eyes up.,
Keep your hands and arms steady.",How to Post While Trotting on a Horse," The main reason to post while riding is to avoid being jostled around in the saddle during a particularly bumpy gait - the trot. This makes things more comfortable for the rider and is easier on the horse's back.


Once you become more experienced with the rising trot, it is also possible to change the horse's rhythm simply by posting more quickly or slowly.
The horse will alter his rhythm to match with your own, thus sometimes eliminating the need for hand and leg signals.;
, Urge your horse into a steady forward trot. Now, pay attention to the horse's strides - notice how the trot has two beats? Good. This will help you to understand how posting works.


During a trot, the horse's left hind leg and right front leg (which are diagonal to one another) move simultaneously, and vice versa. This is what riders are talking about when they refer to ""diagonals"" - the simultaneous movement of diagonal front and back legs.
These diagonals will greatly influence your rising trot. When performed correctly, the rider will rise from his/her seat when the inside hind leg and outside front leg are moving forward and sit when the outside hind leg and inside front leg are moving forward.
The reason for this is because the horse's inside hind leg is the one which propels him forward. Rising out of your seat while this leg is in motion will encourage the horse to stretch the leg further under his body, and therefore producing a more effective stride.
At first, it can be difficult to tell which diagonal your horse is on. A good trick is to watch your horse's outside shoulder. You should rise out of your seat as his shoulder moves forward and sit back down as it moves back.
If the movement is difficult to pinpoint, stick a bandage or piece of colored tape on the horse's shoulder. This makes the movement easier to see., Once you start posting your legs will likely be sore, but you'll gain more thigh muscles over time., Don't pull back, rather act like your elbows are removed from your moving body and you're holding the horse's hand (or, rather, his mouth)., As you rise your pelvis should go forward and up, gliding up into the space between your hands without any interruptions. Your back should be straight, with your chest up and your shoulders back. As you go down, sit softly into the saddle only for enough time as takes to rise again. The entire movement of posting should be very upward based, and when your seat touches the saddle it should be done very lightly, and immediately be proceeded by rising again.

Firstly, sitting straight up and down takes too long and will cause you to lose your rhythm. Secondly, standing up straight in the stirrups will cause your legs to involuntarily shoot forward, throwing you off balance. And thirdly, rising straight up will cause you to land heavily in the saddle, which puts pressure on the horses back and defeats the purpose of posting in the first place.
Instead, you should try to move forwards and backwards while rising, as this is a much more organic movement. When your horse's outer front leg goes forward, move your pelvis forwards towards the top of the pommel. You should only rise an inch or two out of your seat - just enough to clear the saddle.
Don't use your feet to propel yourself - in fact, your legs don't come into the equation at all! Point your knees towards the ground, then squeeze your inner thigh muscles to lift your pelvis out of the saddle.
As you rise out of your seat, lean forwards at a 30 degree angle. This helps you to move more naturally with the horse, allowing him to trot better. The one exception to this is in dressage, where the shoulders stay straight, in line with the hips.
As the horse's outside shoulder move back, sit down softly into the saddle., When you change rein (that is, change direction when riding in an arena), your horse's inner hind leg and outer front leg will switch diagonals, which means you will have to change your posting rhythm.


To change diagonals, remain seated for one extra stride, so when you rise from your seat it will be in sync with the forward motion of your horse's (new) inner hind leg and outer front leg.
In other words, instead of doing up - down - up - down you will do up - down - down - up. It sounds complicated, but it's easy once you get the hang of it.
You don't need to worry about changing diagonals when you're out on a hack, as the horse has no ""inner"" or ""outer"" legs outside of the arena. However, this gives you a good opportunity to practice posting and changing diagonals, as you can decide to switch sides as often as you like.

, Sitting down too heavily is a major problem for riders new to the rising trot. It puts pressure on the horses back, causing him to shorten his stride and possible throwing him off balance.


As long as you are posting by moving forwards and backwards instead of straight up and down, you should be able to avoid a very heavy landing.
However, stiffness can also be an issue, so make sure to soften your knees and try to move naturally with the horse.

, If your legs are two far forwards, you will end up leaning backwards and if your legs are too far back, you will end up leaning forward - neither of which are ideal for the posting trot.


Try to keep your legs at the girth ( the middle of the horse) as this will ensure your back stays in the correct position.
You should also try to avoid making involuntary leg movements (which are common while posting) as this can give the horse mixed signals, as he thinks you are kicking him or urging him forwards.
These involuntary movements usually occur when your lower legs are too loose, but your knees and thighs are too tight. You can combat this by relaxing your upper legs and tightening your lower legs, keeping your calves pressed lightly against your horse's barrel at all times., Many riders become so absorbed with matching their rising movement to the horse's gait that they spend the whole time staring at the horse's shoulders and forget to keep track of their surroundings.


This is an easy habit to get into, but a hard one to break. Not only are you less aware of what's going on around you, you will also be inclined to slump your shoulders forward which affects your posture and ability to post.
Get out of this habit by picking a point to look at while you post, whether it's the top of the trees or a nearby roof. This will also help you to learn how to time your rising trot correctly through feel alone, rather than by sight.

, Many riders have a tendency to bounce their hands and arms up and down as they post. This is incorrect, as it disrupts your contact with the horse and confuses your aiding system.


Try to keep your hands and arms steady, keeping them in the exact same position, even as the rest of your body moves forwards and backwards.
If it helps, imagine your hips moving between your elbows as you rise."

Find a show that is relatively close to you and register.,
Get ready for the show!,
When the day comes, trailer your horse out to the show, you'll want to get there early.

,
Prepare your horse like you do for normal practice.,
Check in with the show office to get your number and exhibitors' packet.

,
Don't get dressed in your show clothes until a half-hour before your first class.

,
Warm your horse up.,
When it's time for the show, line up with the other contestants, and ride in when the ring steward tells you to.They will usually call the numbers of the competitors in each class.,
Ride along the railing, if the horse in front of you is too slow, pass it in the middle of the arena.,
If your horse is consistently getting too close behind other horses, but there is room between you and the following rider, ride your horse in a small (10-meter) circle to make more room.

,
Watch out for horses with a red ribbon in their tail!,
Perform the gaits the judge tells you to.Typically this is walk, trot and canter, with a change of direction and walk, trot and canter in the opposite direction.,
Pleasure class judges like to see smiling riders!,
Finish and ride into the line.

,
Ride out after you've been placed!

",How to Compete in an English Pleasure Class," During this step you should also pick out/find a horse you will be riding and how you will get it there.;
, A good idea is to spend the day before traveling to the show doing maintenance: grooming, bathing and clipping your horse, cleaning and polishing tack (glycerin soaps work well), hitching the trailer to your tow vehicle and loading your tack and supplies into the trailer's tack room. That way when you get up the next morning to go to the show, all you have to do is pull up the trailer, load your horse and go.

,, Don't do anything too different, like using a different bridle than normal, just try to stick to the same.

,,, Walk around the warm-up arena so he gets acquainted with his surroundings, then trot for a few minutes.

, Don't ignore them, when you hear your class and number called report promptly to the ring steward and state your name, horse's name and your number. Shows often have a PA system in the warm-up arena to tell riders when their classes are. This will follow the standard athletic pattern of ""Class Number ## in the ring, Class ## be ready, Class ## on deck.""

, If you're passing a slower rider, let them know by quietly but clearly saying ""Inside.""

,, This means they kick. If your horse is prone to kicking, be sure to put a red ribbon on their tail to warn other riders.

, Some judges ask exhibitors to halt and back on the rail, others wait to ask for the back-up when the riders and their horses are in line.

, Don't plaster a fake smile on — smile like you mean it and let the judge and audience know that your horse is a good one and fun to ride.

Be comfortable walking with your horse.,
Urge your horse into a walk.,
Sit as correctly as possible.,
Squeeze both legs on your horse, with a little bit harder pressure on the inside leg (if you squeeze the outside leg harder, this is the aid for canter).,
Get on the right diagonal to post.,
Guide the horse's speed.,
To make your horse slow to a walk, sit back deeply in the saddle and squeeze the reins.,
Keep practicing as many times as necessary until you feel comfortable in this gait.

",How to Trot1," You're not ready to trot until you're 100 percent confident with the walking.


Know all the basic things, such as asking your horse to halt, turn or move forward.
When you are comfortable with walking you can know move on to a trot. Make sure you are relaxed as your horse can sense all your tension and may not respond well to commands.;
, Keep the walk smooth and rhythmic. If your horse is having a hard time walking, nudge him/her with your heels.

, Keep your back straight, your heels lower than your toes, and the balls of your feet on the stirrup irons (toes to the nose as well). Your elbow and hand should be creating a straight line to the bit.


Always aim to sit back instead of leaning forward, Leaning will cause you to lose your balance.
Make sure that you are putting all your pressure into your heels and not pressing down on the reins, as this can hurt the horse's mouth.

, If the horse doesn't respond, tap the horse lightly with your crop. Try not to kick your horse, because this only dulls him/her.


Squeeze tightly with your legs and give your horse a couple of kicks until you can feel that you are going in a 1, 2, 1, 2 rhythm.
Trotting can be very uncomfortable, as it bounces a lot, and makes you move around in the saddle. To make you feel more in control and balanced, gently rise up and down to the rhythm of the horse.

, Diagonal is when you go up the horse's shoulder closest to the wall should go forward then when you go down the horse's shoulder should go back. An easy way to remember this: ""Rise and fall with the leg on the wall."" While this is the extreme basics of posting, you might want to know why you do it. Not only are you raising yourself up when the outside shoulder-blade comes forward, but you are lifting yourself off of their back when the inside hind leg comes forward. Hence 'diagonal.' This allows their inside leg to extend farther and the horse can use itself more efficiently. A lot of people blindly post and have no idea why they do it.

, Your horse should always be moving forward, but remain collected in your hands. His energy should be powered by your legs and caught in your hands, not by jerking on his mouth or kicking. Don't choose to whack your horse or to kick him/her as your very first option for changing speed. Use good horsemanship instead:


If your horse starts to slow down, squeeze or nudge slightly with your heels and lower calves while you are coming down from the post to keep them in a consistent trot.
If your horse starts to want to walk, squeeze with your calves and heels. If your horse starts to want to canter, sit up straighter and give them a nub with the reins (don't pull though). Keep your hands low to their neck and the reins loose at all times.
If your horse starts going too fast, you might want to give the horse a little nub with the reins. Sometimes horses stumble after going so fast.
If you want to go into a canter, slightly tighten the reins and squeeze with your outside leg. Finally, if you want to go even faster, or your horse won't listen, use a whip, this gives them the boost they may need.

, Or, gently pull, if necessary.

Know that the secret to leg-yielding is in timing.,
Mount your horse.,
Keeping your body straight, when the horse's outside shoulder is up (when you are rising), shift your hips to the outside as though you are going to stand in that stirrup.,
Get the horse to take one or two steps at a leg-yield, then allow them to move straight and forward again.,As the horse learns the signal, you will be able to perform a leg-yield by simply shifting your weight slightly to the outside

",How to Leg Yield1," In order to really get a feel for it, it is necessary to begin without being mounted. Have an assistant in the ring that can have her hands free. Begin by walking in a straight line with your assistant walking on your left. Have her put her hand on your ribcage (approximately the same place a riders leg would be if you were a horse). First, have her push gently on you every time your left foot is on the ground. You will notice that you bend around the pressure, but can continue to walk in a straight line without much trouble. Then, have your assistant begin to push you gently when your right foot is on the ground. You will find that you have to step over in order to stay upright.;
, Start at a rising trot (posting). The signal will come when the horses outside shoulder (the shoulder toward which you want to go, in this case) is up.

, Your inside leg will automatically come in against the horse's side. With a surprisingly small amount of pressure, you will cause the horse to step over (you are acting like your assistant's hand on your side.)

, Make sure to praise the horse.

,"
"
Be comfortable walking with your horse.,
Have your helper lunge your horse with you on the horse.

,
Have the helper guide the horse into a trot.,
When you feel comfortable, take control of the reins.,
When you think you are really ready to trot by yourself ,get your helper to stop lunging your horse.,
When you know how to trot without any worry, try a canter.",How to Trot2," You're not ready to trot until you're 100 percent confident with the walking.

,, Your helper should start to make your horse go from a walk to a trot and while you're getting used to it. Loosen your rains and hold the saddle.

, Start to rise as the horse's shoulder goes forward. Go down as its shoulder comes back.

, Then squeeze your horse a bit more tightly than you would normally do and the horse should trot.


If your horse starts slowing down squeeze in again.
If your horse starts to go into a canter, don't panic. Just gently pull the reins in a bit until your horse goes into a trot again.

, It is often a lot easier to canter than trot as it is less constrained.

"
"
Ride in a straight line.

,
With your core muscles, lighten the seat bone which is on the hind leg that you want to cross over.,
as the horse's hind leg is off the ground, push with your right leg, (when using the example above) and move your left leg out of the horse's way so that he can cross over and move sideways.

,
Keep pushing in until the horse moves sideways with its head facing forwards.

,
Pat the horses on the shoulder so it knows it has done well.

,
Don't practice too often or the horse will get bored.

,
Try to keep the horses brain active.

,
Practice doing it weaving in and out of cones.

,
The cones might need to be further apart as the whole side length of the horse will need to fit between it.",How to Leg Yield2,", For example, if you are leg yielding to the left, lighten your right seat bone by scrunching up the right side of your core, making sure that you keep your upper body straight.

,,,,,,,


Note: As you are practicing the leg yield, make sure that your horse does not simply fall onto the shoulder that is the direction that you want him to go, make sure he stays balanced and straight, crossing over the hind leg to reach into your hand and stretch through your outside rein. the steps do not have to be fast, but rather even and rhythmic with your horse's gaits.

Get your horse moving in a working trot.,
Sit back.,
Signal for the canter at the right time.,
Signal your horse to canter.,
Hold your body in a neutral position.,
Move your hips with the rhythm of the canter.,
Follow the horse's head with your reins.,
Keep your legs loose and relaxed.,
Make sure you're not gripping too hard with your knees.,
Check the lengths of your stirrups.,
Return to the trot or the walk if you grasp the reins during the canter.,
Consider riding without stirrups periodically.",How to Sit the Canter Properly," Before you can move into the canter, you want to get your horse into a working trot. The trot is a bouncy gait, slightly faster than walking. You can squeeze your legs when the horse is walking to signal him to trot. Allow your horse to get into a nice, rhythmic trot as you circle your riding arena. Keep trotting for several minutes to warm up your horse and prepare for the canter transition., You'll need to sit back slightly during the canter. In preparation to signal, shift your weight backwards in the saddle. You do not want to shift too far back, as this can cause you to lose to control.Shift your weight from your pelvis to your seat bones. You should never hunch forward when you signal for the canter.
Make sure you can feel your seat bones resting against the back curve of your saddle as well as the horse's back. If you cannot feel your seat bones on the saddle, you've shifted back too far.

, You want to signal for the canter at a time when it's easy for the horse to transition. Signal for your horse to canter just before you reach a corner or when you're rounding the corner of a circle., To signal your horse to canter, squeeze with the leg facing the inside of your riding arena. Move the leg facing outside of the arena slightly behind the horse's girth and squeeze to signal., When you're cantering, you'll want to hold your body in a neutral position. This allows you to best follow your horse's lead. The same neutral position you would hold during the halt should be maintained during the canter.You should be sitting up straight enough that your ear, shoulder, hip, and heel align. They should form a vertical line that is perpendicular to the ground.
Keep your back straight, but do not arch your lower back. Remember, your shoulders should line up with your ear, so resist the urge to move your shoulders back, causing your back to arch.

, When cantering, you want to move with the horse. The canter is a three-beat gait, and you'll want to let your hips follow the rocking of your horse's back.During the canter, the horse's inside hip and outside hip move up and down in quick succession. The horse's hind feet will then push off the ground, causing both hips to rise.
Allow your body to shift along with the horse's shifting hips. You will have to tilt, shift, and then rise your hips slightly while keeping your buttocks in the saddle. This will not happen overnight. It will take a lot of practice, as well as you getting used to your horse's particular rhythm, before you can sit the canter without trouble.
Your core muscles will also build over time as you practice the canter. Strong core muscles help you maintain a neutral position, allowing your hips to move more freely.

, You should also move your arms back and forth slightly in the rhythm of the horse's head, which also moves during the canter. If you struggle to move the reins, you may want to loosen the reins slightly before you canter. This gives your horse enough neck room to move his head without tension., During the canter, many people feel an inclination to grip with their legs. However, this actually makes it harder to maintain your balance. Strive to let your legs hang loosely at your side, lightly wrapping around the horse. Squeezing your legs can confuse the horse and cause you difficulty during the canter.Not hollowing or arching your back can help prevent your legs from swinging excessively during the canter, which can also happen if you're gripping too tightly., You may find yourself bouncing a lot in the saddle when cantering, a problem caused by gripping too tightly with the knees. If you're a young rider, you may feel inclined to grip with your knees for balance. This actually makes balance harder to maintain.You want to instead stretch your leg downward during the canter, allowing it to lie somewhat loosely at the horse's side.
Stretch your calf muscles and shift your weight into your heels. This should cause your knees to lock less, allowing you to more efficiently sit the canter.

, If your stirrups are too long, this can make it very difficult to sit the canter. You may have tightened your stirrups before riding, thinking shorter stirrups would give you more control. The opposite is the case.Remove your legs from the stirrups for a moment. If they're the right length, they should bump against your ankle bone if you're riding with English stirrups.
When riding with Western stirrups, your stirrups should be long enough that you can easily tip your toe forward and get your foot in the stirrup, while bending your leg slightly.

, You do not want to canter before you're ready. If you find yourself gripping the reins tight before cantering, this is a sign of tension. This will make it difficult for your horse to control the motions of his head enough to canter properly, and will also make it hard for you to balance in the saddle. If you can't canter without gripping the reins, return to walk for a few minutes before trying again.If you can't seem to stay calm while sitting the canter, you may want to wait a few weeks and then try to canter again.

, Many young riders have issues gripping with the legs during the canter. If this is an issue you have, try riding at a walk or trot without your legs in the stirrups. This will help you improve your seat and balance during the canter.Make sure you only do so under the supervision of an instructor, especially if you are a young rider.

Learn how to post.,
Learn your diagonals.,
Improve your sitting trot.,
Have fun trotting!,
Make them listen to you don't let them take control.",How to Trot a Horse," Keep your horse at a lively, balanced walk. Check that he is ""on the aids"" (which means listening to your signals) by speeding up and slowing down at the walk. When you are ready, shorten your reins and give him short, brisk squeezes with your legs until he begins trotting. If your horse needs extra encouragement, you can say ""trot!"" or give him a quick kick with your legs. Don't think you are going to hurt them. They are stronger than you but, don't kick too hard.;
,


When you first begin trotting, you should only trot for a little while before walking again. For example, you can count five trot strides and then walk.
You will probably be very bouncy and unbalanced when you first start trotting. In order to prevent pulling on your reins and hurting your horse's mouth, it's best to hold on to the pommel of your saddle or your horse's mane.

, When you first start trotting, it's a good idea to keep your horse at a very slow, steady trot. This will help you relax and follow your horse's movement. Remember not to grip with your thighs, knees, or calves - they should rest evenly against your horse's sides as you balance yourself with your seat. Keep your hips, knees, and ankles as springy as you can - imagine that they quietly absorb the jolting movement of the trot.

, Posting means to rise up and down with the strides of your horse's trot. Remember not to try to force yourself to post - the trot is bouncy enough that it will move you softly up and down. The pressure on your stirrups should remain steady as you rise and sit; instead of bracing your ankles and forcing yourself upward, you move gently up and down with springy, supple ankles.

, When a horse trots, he uses diagonal pairs of legs together. First he reaches forward with his left foreleg and right hind leg, and then he reaches forward with his right foreleg and left hind leg. This makes the trot a two-beat gait - you can count ""1-2-1-2"" or ""clip-clop"" as your horse trots. When you are trotting correctly, you should rise up as your horse's outside shoulder (the shoulder closest to the arena fence) moves forward.


When you have had a lot of practice at posting, you'll be able to simply feel whether you're on the right diagonal or not. While you're learning, however, you can check by peeking out of the side of your eye. Try not to tip your head - this will unbalance you.

, Once you can post the trot with balance and coordination, you can begin to improve your sitting trot. Begin by sitting the trot only for five strides and then walking or posting the trot. You can go on a circle and switch between posting and sitting, or you can post the trot on the long sides of the arena and sit on the short sides. Remember to keep your hips, knees, and ankles supple and springy, and try to feel your seat melting deeper in the saddle. Be careful not to brace your legs at the sitting trot, or grip with your knees - if you do, simply slow your horse down until you can balance again.


Some horses' trots are easier to sit than others'. It's best not to learn how to trot or sit the trot on a horse with a very bouncy, uncomfortable trot.

, Trotting is a lot of fun once you've gotten the hang of it, and it's a great way to improve your riding. Don't forget to give your horse a treat after your ride, but be sure to take off the bridle first.

, Make sure that your horse is always on your rein and you keep contact via their mouth and girth. Keep a good position while you ride and remember to sit lightly. And when you want to stop, rest your reins at the beginning of your horses mane.

Sit tall and deep in the saddle.,
Use your rein aid.,
Lengthen your legs slightly.,
Create a slight resistance in your seat to suggest a halt.,
When the horse shifts down, apply your driving aids.,
Do not let the half-halt last longer than one stride.,
Do not overdo the reins.,
Do not wait too long for the half-halt.,
Communicate clearly to the horse with your aids.,
Practice your seat aid at home before trying on the horse.,
Build the horse's expectation to halt through with a trot-to-walk exercise.,
Evolve your half-halt signal from a halt.",How to Perform a Half Halt," Your body should be flowing with the movement of the horse's, rather than holding stiffly. Relax your shoulders up and back. This way, the horse can more easily sense signals from the seat.;
, When you're first learning the half-halt, it's likely you'll use your hands more than when you get accustomed to the signal. Let the signal be very slight: turn your wrists in to increase contact with the bit.Do not pull on the reins.
You'll probably notice the horse lighten the bit and stride more evenly – however, this is most likely not a true half-halt (where the pace is maintained in the hind legs), but rather a disengagement of the hocks and consequent disruption of energy.
If the horse hollows his back and raises his head, these are also signs that you need to continue to adjust your signal by engaging other aids., This signals the horse to deepen his hind-leg step., Briefly tighten your lower back muscles and squeeze your rear end, as though you were sitting on a swing and propelling yourself forward.If your elbows are hanging at your sides, the slight change in your back should travel through your arms into the reins, giving the horse enough of a signal that you do not need to manipulate the reins at all., Once you sense a bit of ""halt,"" signal to him to keep moving steadily forward. You may do this primarily with your seat or leg, or with the two in combination. Push your seat in a forward motion.Apply pressure with your leg lightly at the horse's side. Keeping your legs lightly against the horse's side throughout the half-halt helps ease the transition into driving forward., Pulling on the reins or bracing for too long against the horse may cause the horse to lean against your hands, rush off, or become unresponsive to your aids.


If your half-halt was unsuccessful, try again in another stride, this time with a little more emphasis.

, Remember, most of the half-halt signal comes from the seat and leg aids. You may find you don't need to do anything to the reins at all. If you do, rather than tugging on them, squeeze them gently as though squeezing a sponge.

, Some horses need a half halt in the first strides of their cantor or trot in order to establish the rider's control over the pace. If you wait too long for the half-halt, the horse may have gathered too much momentum to execute it., It's important that you have a precise concept of the half-halt signal and what each aid is telling the horse. Some say the half-halt is like talking to the horse, but you must know what you want to say. In short, ""ho and go."",


In a seated position, push downward with your lower back and rear end as though you were on a swing and pushing it forward. This helps you get used to the half-halt signal.
When you're ready, practice on the horse in a walk: squeeze your seat and apply just a light pressure to the reins.
If the horse halts, reward it by gently scratching him and praising him.
Keep practicing this until the horse responds to the seat aid with minimal (or no) rein pressure.
When you've mastered that, repeat those steps from a trot.
If the horse is confused, you can return to the walk-halt exercise to reinforce the meaning of the signal., This simple exercise can help make the half-halt signal clear. In a way, both you and the horse are learning at the same time.


In a dressage arena, ask for a transition from trot to walk at A, E, C and B.
Walk a few strides only, move back to a trot.
Repeat this for a few circuits. The horse will quickly learn the pattern and expect to slow down at the given letters.
Next, at those letters begin to ask for a transition to walk, but at the last minute change your mind and stay in the trot.
This method lets you give a small suggestion of half-halt, and since the horse is expecting the signal, he is likely to respond. When you tell him to continue, he'll rebalance and move forward., Like the above exercise, this builds the horse's expectation of a change, this time working from a full halt. Try this if your horse doesn't respond to the exercise in Step 2, or use the two exercises in combination.


Signal a full halt and let the horse rest for two minutes.
Trot about 40 yards (37 m), then signal another full halt, resting again for two minutes.
After trotting another 40 yards (36.6 m), start your halt signal, but as soon as you feel the horse shifting downward, drive him forward."

Set up a training schedule.,
Check your horse’s mount.,
Warm up your horse.,
Trot your horse.,
Increase trotting to a lope.,
Return to a trot.,
Cool down your horse.,
Assess your horse’s condition.,
Work with a coach.",How to Make a Horse Run Faster1," You can condition your horse just by running it regularly. However, setting up a plan for how you want to train your horse can help you measure her progress and keep you on task.Keep your training consistent for the first eight weeks. For example, you may want to run your horse every day for this first phase. Once you’ve built up the horse’s endurance, you can decrease the number of training days to four or five.Allot equal amounts of time for warm-up, trotting, loping, long trotting, and cool down. You may want to set a specific distance, such as four miles, and split up each section by miles.
Add a variant such as a sprint every couple of days to change the training routine, which can help better develop your horse’s muscles.
Observe and note changes to your horse’s condition each week. Reset your goals or training program as needed.;
, Comfort is an important factor in your horse’s ability to accelerate and can make conditioning easier for you and her. Make sure her mount is properly fitted and nothing is broken or worn to help ensure your horse is comfortable. An uncomfortable mount could make your horse not want to go faster or move its legs.Check the following items on the mount:


Saddle tree, to make sure it doesn’t move
Saddle bars, for loose rivets
Flaps, for weak or loose stitching
Billets, for dryness
Stirrups, for dryness and wear
Bridle, for rough edges that could harm your horse’s delicate mouth

, Before you start any conditioning routine or exercises, it’s important to let your horse warm up its legs and body. This can remove lingering soreness or swelling and prevent injury.Allow your horse to walk at a leisurely pace for 15-30 minutes. Consider walking her in both directions as well as in circles.
Be careful when making circles with your horse. Keep them gentle and interspersed with straight walking. Circles can be physically hard on your horse., In order to get your horse into a faster run, it will need to trot for a distance. Trotting is a pace that is faster than a walk but slower than a lope or run. Depending on your training plan, you can trot your horse for a certain time or distance.Encourage your horse to trot with verbal or physical cues such as clucks or a gentle push from the stirrups.Add sprints, or long lopes, to the trotting phase to build your horse’s muscles. For example, you could trot for 30 minutes and then add a one minute sprint followed by another 15 minutes of trotting. Alter this pattern as you and your horse wish., About half of your horse’s training program should be at a lope, or running, pace. Once she is comfortably trotting, cue her to speed up into a run.Break up the loping phase into manageable chunks. For example, you could let your horse lope for a mile and then allow her to trot for a minute or two before starting another mile lope.Be aware that your horse may not be able to lope for long distances if she is in the early phases of training. Either decrease the speed or length until she is ready to lope for a specific time or distance.

, After your horse has loped for the allotted time or distance, decrease the speed into a trot, which some people call breezing.You can break up this phase into two parts for optimal training: the first part can be a long trot and the second part a slow trot.Consider varying the trot with moments of walking or loping to build the horse’s endurance and muscles.
Be aware that the long trot after loping can lengthen his stride and help him tuck his belly., Horses can get warm or overheat during training. Cooling your horse down after a good training session can help reinforce the training, remove lactic acid from its muscles, and prevent injuries.Walk your horse as a way to cool it down. Keep the cool down time commensurate with the training. For example, if you increase the speed or distance, you should make sure your horse has more walking time at the end of the session.Give your horse a treat for a good workout and make sure she has fresh food and water, which provide her proper nutrition and hydration and can help her run faster.

, After about 45 days, you should be able to see a difference in your horse’s muscle tone and endurance. Take the time to look at the progress your horse has made and adjust your training plan as necessary.Allow your horse sufficient time to rest in between training sessions. This can help prevent injuries. If your horse seems lethargic, has long or dull looking hair, or shows signs of injury such as limping, it may not be rested enough or have a condition that needs immediate medical attention from a vet.
Injured ligaments and torn muscles are common in horses that are training too much for their condition. It’s also common for overtrained or out of shape horses to not react quickly to commands or cues. Remember to not push your horse too hard and give it ample time to recover in between sessions.

, If you are not an expert at training horses, consider hiring a coach or another horse professional to help you design your training plan. You may want to spend money for a private training session, which can help the coach identify any problems with your horse’s gait or condition. The coach can then suggest a way to remedy the issue and help your horse get faster and stronger.Make a list of questions and concerns you have for the coach. Be sure to include your goals for your horse, a health history, and any other pertinent information. Make sure you are completely honest if the coach asks questions. Not doing so could cause harm to your horse or not effectively get it to the goals you’ve set.

Cue your horse with voice commands.,
Use hand aids.,
Connect leg aids with hand signals.,
Avoid artificial aids.",How to Make a Horse Run Faster2," Once of the most simple and effective ways to get your horse to run faster is to command her. Although horses won’t understand words in the same way a human does, they do understand simple commands such as “trot” or “gallop” and even sounds such as clucking or smooching.Make sure to use short and consistent words when cueing your horse. For example, if you want to get her to go faster always use the term “lope” or “run” instead of using them interchangeably. You also need to make sure that you clearly say the words.
Watch the tone and pitch of your voice. Keep them soft and gentle because your horse won’t respond to yelling or anger.
Back up verbal cues with other aids or signals until your horse runs faster. Once your horse speeds up, you don’t need to give her any further verbal commands until you want her to slow down.

, Your horse’s reins are another way to communicate with her to speed up. In most cases, you will need to combine hand aids with leg aids for the most effective way to communicate your wishes to the horse. The better you know your horse, the more you will understand the most effective hand and leg aids to use.Move your hands in a forward direction along with leg pushing to signals to the horse to lengthen its stride on a trot or lope.
Keep your hands level and raised above the horses wither without crossing over the horses neck. Use the hand aid until you’re ready for your horse to slow down.

, In most cases, a leg aid is used with a hand aid. The leg aid reinforces commands and can gently nudge your horse forward. Try different combinations of leg and hand commands to see what works best for your horse.Check to make sure your leg is in the proper position when you mount your horse. It should fall right behind the girth strap on the saddle, which spans the largest area of your horse’s body.
Apply a gentle inward pressure with your leg or foot to cue your horse to go forward and increase her speed. A light tap also works. If your leg hits your horse’s elbow, adjust it so that it strikes just behind the girth strap. This can prevent miscommunication or injury to your horse.
Stop using leg commands once your horse begins running faster. You can use them again when you want your horse to slow down.

, Whips and spurs are man-made aids that some people use to make their horses run faster. However, there is conflicting evidence on whether they’re effective signals for a horse. In addition, they may cause injury or trauma to your horse, which may make her reluctant to run at all.Consider staying away from whips altogether. Evidence suggests that they do not perform better when whipped, but actually worse. In addition, whips can cause harm to your horse if used excessively or on the wrong parts of its body.Wear spurs only if you are an experienced rider. Spurs are worn on the heel to give a more precise leg aid but can cause significant damage to a horse’s side if not used properly."

, Don't let your butt come off the saddle. Try to stay with the motion of your horse. It should feel as if you're rocking your hips slightly when you sit the canter.

, Keep the heels down., Seek to enjoy it, because if you are worrying the wobbliness out of a jelly, then you shouldn't be on a horse. Just relax, have fun and get used to the rhythm of the canter."

Get comfortable with cantering.,
Practice standing up in your stirrups at a trot or canter.,
Adjust the stirrups (assuming you aren't riding bareback).,
Ride the horse at a walk or trot for at least ten minutes before you allow the horse to begin galloping.,
Slowly pick up speed (rather than forcing the horse to go up to a gallop immediately).,
Stand up in your stirrups.,
Ease into a gallop.",How to Keep Your Balance on a Galloping Horse," You must be able to control your horse and feel happy in a canter before attempting to gallop.;
, Learn how to ride in the 2-point position. Lean forward and hold the horse's mane (which helps you keep your balance without using the reins for balance). Keep your seat-bones pointing down towards the saddle, your abdominal muscles pushing your lower back out so your back stays straight rather than arching inwards, and your weight in your pelvis rather than your shoulders. The rider shown in this photo has their weight in their shoulders and is therefore not really stable over their feet. Your upper body and head will remain stable while your arms and legs will be absorbing the movements of the horse. Think of someone who is skiing down moguls. If you are doing this correctly and your horse stumbles, you will sit down automatically and get deeper in the saddle rather than pitching forward towards the horse's neck.

, You want to be able to stand up in the stirrups and clear the saddle. It may be counter-intuitive, but shorter stirrups actually provide a more secure position as they encourage your heels to sink down.

, This will enable it to warm up and stretch out. Also, you will be familiarizing yourself with the horse's personality and signals.

, That way, you can continually adjust until you can keep on perfectly.

, Go into the ""2-point"" position.

, Go to a good-sized hill (it is safer to gallop uphill, as it is harder for the horse to trip) and get your horse to canter in 2-point. Once it is steady, urge your horse to go faster into a gallop.

Keep your core strong.",How to Canter With Your Horse," As some horse experts might tell you, ""you can't teach the canter from the canter.""Horses need good foundational knowledge of the trot and walk (plus the muscle strength that comes from learning these commands) to learn the canter properly. Without this, your horse may have difficulty maintaining safe canter form, which can be bad for you and (especially) the horse.


This is extra true with young, inexperienced (or ""green"") horses. Since the canter is what's called a ""three-beat gait,"" it puts the horse's entire body weight on the outside hind leg when it steps off. Young horses typically don't develop the strength necessary to do this safely without good foundational training.;
, The canter should be taught in a flat, open space that's at least about 60 feet (about 20 meters) wide. Begin by trotting at a steady, comfortable pace (in whichever direction is easiest for you to control.)


Horses need lots of space to balance properly as they're learning the canter, so don't skimp and use a space that's too small. In some cases, a lack of space can even lead some horses to become panicky or agitated.Note that, at this point, the horse should be tacked up with bridle, saddle, side reins, and boots., Before you teach the canter the first time, you want your horse attentive and responsive to you. To do this, give the horse a few commands that it already knows. For instance, try transitioning between a walk and a trot and back again a few times until the horse is sharp to your commands and is responding instantly.

, Now, you're ready to perform the canter command. Get the horse moving in a wide circle at a trot once again. When you're ready, say ""can-TER"" in a sharp (but not angry) voice.The goal here is to associate your verbal command with the act that you're about to ease your horse into doing — eventually, your voice alone should be enough to get a good canter from your horse.


When you make this command, you'll execute a few commands with your body (described in the next step) simultaneously. For more detail on these body cues, see the section below.


, As soon as you give the ""can-TER"" command, slide your inside hip (the side pointing to the inside of the circle you're trotting in) forward and your outside hip backward. As you do this, squeeze with your inside leg and slide the outside leg back. Ideally, the horse should interpret your actions as a command to go faster. See the section below for greater detail and for information on proper form and posture once you begin to canter.


Note, however, that if the horse doesn't seem to notice your command, you can use a lunge whip or another riding aid (gently) to get its attention.However, this works best if the horse is already comfortable using these aids — if not, they may confuse it.

, If, after giving the canter command, the horse stays in a two-beat trot and doesn't transition into a three-beat canter, give the command (and the body motions) once again. The horse should go faster still. If necessary, repeat the command again. After a certain point, it will need to transition from the trot to the canter to go any faster.


Once your horse transitions into the canter, be sure to reward it by praising enthusiastically with your voice. If you desire, pat the horse on the neck. Over time, these rewards should associate following your commands with positive feelings in the horse's mind.

, Believe it or not, a basic canter can be quite fatiguing to a young horse that hasn't built up its riding muscles yet. Be attentive to your horse's movement as it canters underneath you. As soon as you feel the canter begin to become unbalanced or off-rhythm, transition back into a trot and immediately give a half-halt command to get the horse's movements back under control. See the section below for more detailed information on performing a half halt.


Note that, at first, a horse may be able to do less than a single full circle of cantering at once. This is OK — with frequent practice, the horse will become stronger and more confident.
Using an experienced rider as an observer can help immensely here.

, Get your horse trotting in a circle again and repeat the steps above to start another canter. Repeat this several more times, staying conscious of your horse's fatigue as you do so. You may notice that your horse becomes more responsive to your commands within a single training session. If not, be patient — this will come with time.


Keep training sessions short at first so that the horse doesn't become overly tired or lose interest. A training session of about 20 minutes is fine for the first month or so of training., When you're riding your horse ""for real"", you won't be limited to simply cantering in a circle. To give your horse the sort of versatility that it will need for cantering in practical situations, try changing up your training routine once it's comfortable with the one described above. A few good ideas are:Canter and trot in figure-eights to get your horse used to turning to both sides.
Trot tight circles at the corners of your training area, making your horse canter from one to the next in sequence.
Canter and trot in a long, winding course of your own design.
After a month of training, try executing a half-halt during a canter.

, While professionals may make it seem effortless, a good canter results as much from the rider's efforts as it does from the horse's. As you canter, your body should be positioned to open the front (leading) shoulder of the horse and to cue the horse behind the girth, all while adding forward movement. Assume the following posture while you trot to prepare to transition into a canter.


Keep your back straight.
Keep your chest up.
""Open"" your chest by drawing your shoulders back gently.
Use the core muscles of your hips and abs for balance. Ideally, you should be able to canter without pulling on the reins, pommel, or saddle horn to steady yourself., As you work into the canter, maintain good rein contact contact, but open the inside rein of your horse while holding a firm grip on the outside rein. This will give your horse important support on the diagonal beats. Note, however, that the goal here isn't to support the horse too heavily, as it needs to develop its own sense of balance while cantering.

, As described in the section above, cuing a horse to canter involves several simultaneous motions of the rider's body. Follow the steps below to start cantering:


Turn your torso and shoulders (keeping your hips straight ahead) so that your shoulder on the outside is positioned slightly further back than your shoulder on the inside.
Move your outside leg back. As you do this, give pressure with your inside leg and slide your inside hip forward slightly.
Use the inside rein to pick up the correct lead. This also opens up your horse’s leading shoulder, helping them to understand your intentions while keeping their movement ""collected.""Using your rear leg, squeeze your horse’s barrel and ask for increased speed. Note that some horses are also trained to shift into a canter when you cue them with a ""kissy"" noise (different than clucking for increased speed), so you may need to do this at the same time.
Make sure you are cuing your horse behind the girth — that is, with your feet a few inches back from where they would ordinarily hang.In addition, try not to move your hands forward. These mistakes can get you a fast trot or a side-pass.

, One of the best things about the canter is that it's actually fairly easy to ride. Unlike a trot, a canter is very smooth for the rider, giving a ""More floaty"" feel rather than the ""bumpier"" one of the trot. However, it is possible to ride the canter incorrectly, so use the steps below to ensure you're sitting correctly:


Hold the reins without pulling on them. Just like when you cued the canter, you should have increased contact on the outside rein and light contact on the inside rein. If you feel out of control and are pulling on the reins for balance, then you're going too fast and you should slow your horse down.
Stay balanced in an erect, upright posture. Don’t lean forward or to the inside. Although it may feel like the other way around, the horse actually gets much of its ability to balance based on what you’re doing on its back. If you’re out of balance and tipped forward and in (as many inexperienced riders have a tendency to do), your horse will have a hard time not doing the same.
Avoid gripping with your legs. As with trotting, it can seem instinctual to “hold on” to the horse using your legs. However, this will give the horse mixed signals, as it's usually a cue to speed up. Similar to tugging on the reins, if you feel like you can't stay in the saddle without gripping with your legs, slow down until you can remain seated comfortably., A half-halt is essentially a partial stop, just as its name suggests. The half halt can be performed at any speed and is done similar to the way you would cue a regular halt. This technique gets your horse’s rear feet on the ground, which gives it the necessary strength and balance to either start a collected canter or get their movements under control. You don’t have to cue a half-halt in order to canter, but doing so will give your horse better grounds for moving into the faster gait. Use the steps below to cue a half-halt:At a canter, maintain a soft supporting leg as you sit up and brace your back in preparation for a halt.
Let your elbows come back and put a little pressure on the reins as if you're asking to transition into a trot.
As soon as you feel your horse respond, add more leg, soften your fingers on the rein, and resume cantering. This may feel like you're asking your horse to ""canter in place"" for a brief moment.

, Old-time Western movies have popularized images of cowboys cantering away on their horses with their entire body moving in sync with the horse. While it is a good thing for your hips to move, your torso and shoulders should not sway or rock in time with the horse. This can put both you and your horse off balance, making the canter difficult to sit.

, This is often a problem at any faster gait for beginning riders. Your foot should be situated in the stirrup so that you are putting your weight on the ball of your foot with your toes tipped up slightly and your heel tipped down. This keeps you in balance and helps prevent you from leaning forward or gripping with your legs.


If you have a hard time doing this, your stirrups may be too short. English stirrup irons should be at about ankle bone-height, while Western-style stirrups should be long enough to leave a slight bend in your knee., It can be difficult to keep your hands stationary while the horse is trotting or cantering beneath you. However, if your hands move too much, they can yank at the reins, which can be very confusing for the horse. Try to move your hands only as much as feels natural from the horse's movement — this should get easier with experience.


If you need help keeping your hands still, try gently gripping your horse's mane with your pinkies. The tug of the mane will help keep your hands centered and in-sync with the horse's natural movement., As your hips naturally shift with each of the horse's strides, it can be easy to let the motion carry into your legs as well. This, however, is a bad idea, as excessive leg motions can confuse the horse. Try to keep your leg in the proper ""behind the girth"" riding position for maximum control and sharp responses from your horse.


If you need help, try keeping your heels down in the stirrup (as suggested above.) This tends to naturally push your legs back into the proper position., The so-called ""fetal"" position is a riding mistake that involves leaning forward (sometimes to grab a handhold on the mane, horn, pommel, or reins), gripping with your legs, tipping your toes down and bring your heels up. This a usually a nervous response done in hopes of maintaining balance and preventing the rider from falling off, but, unfortunately, it does just the opposite: it throws your horse out of balance and speeds the horse up.


Good self-control while riding is important to avoid this. When you get anxious, slow your horse down a bit, loosen your legs and lean back. Even if you feel like you’re leaning back too far, odds are that you’ll probably be perfectly vertical (which is good cantering posture.) Resist the urge to ""hunker down"" and grip tightly — remember, this will give you the opposite of what you want.

, It’s not a good habit in general to slouch your shoulders and curve your back while riding, and it is a particularly poor idea when you’re cantering. Make sure your shoulders are always upright and positioned over your hips. This gives you better balance and keeps you from accidentally urging your horse to go faster (see above.)


If you need help maintaining your posture, try using a long crop slid behind your back and in the crook of each elbow while you ride. This will prevent you from slouching forward and will help your arms stay in the correct riding position as well.

, Core strength is essential for cantering, as riding a horse (especially at higher speeds) is a workout that uses the core muscles heavily. Even if you do everything else correctly (shoulders back, heels down, upright position, etc.), if you go soft in the middle this can cause you to lose your center of gravity. Keeping yourself centered with a firm core will help your horse maintain a collected canter and make things easier and more comfortable for you in the long run as you teach your horse new skills.


If you feel like your core muscles aren’t up to par, you may want to practice doing the plank exercise in your free time. Get in pushup position, but balance on your elbows with your forearms laying along the floor. Hold this position for as long as you can, take a one-minute rest, and repeat three times. If you do this every day, you should notice a significant difference in your balance while riding."
"
Before you canter from the walk, you should be able to canter from the trot.,
Pick up a sitting trot around the arena, or in the field, if that's what you're more comfortable with, and trot for at least 5 paces.

,
Move your outside leg back behind the girth, but only far back enough that you feel your hip kind of ""drop"" and shift your inside leg like you're pushing your hip up to your elbow.,
Squeeze your inside leg while pushing with your outside leg (a squeeze but with a SLIGHT forward motion) and encouraging with your seat.,
Keep your reins tight, don't pull, though, and keep moving your seat in time to the horse's hooves.,
Focus on the tempo and pace of your horse's canter, so you know what to expect from the walk.

,
Bring your horse down to a trot, then change directions.,
Repeat the canter on the opposite lead.,
Bring your horse down to a working walk.,
Move your legs into ""canter position"".

,
Begin moving your seat as you do in the canter.,
Repeat ""canter position"" with your legs in place, and be prepared for the canter.,
It's okay if you don't canter on the first try.",How to Canter from the Walk," This is vital in understanding how your horse moves in the canter as well as what pace you can expect.;
,, If you're out in the field, start on either lead but remember to do the exercise on both leads so your horse doesn't become one-sided.

, Your seat should make an almost rocking motion, from back to front, but subtly as you want to push your seat into the saddle. Ideally your seat would never leave the saddle, but it's okay if you rise up to, at most, an inch or two. This is the ""canter position"".

, Your seat should become natural, as you are just moving with the horse.

,, If you are in a field, you can change directions or, if it's a long field, just keep going.

, Note that this is important for flexibility and to ensure your horse isn't one sided, so DO NOT forget this step.

, Make sure your horse's head is bobbing and they have as much energy as at the trot.

,, Remember that in traditional riding, Western or English, the seat is the first aid used, not your voice, hands, or legs. In riding, you shouldn't need vocal commands. They're a crutch. An occasional kissing noise or clucking for encouragement, but saying ""canter"" and letting your horse canter is teaching them that that word means go, regardless who it's from, and is encouraging you, the rider, to form habits of not going through the steps of speeding up or slowing down. That'll impact you if you get on a non-vocally trained horse or step into a show ring. Don't just kick your horse to make them go and pull the reins to make them stop and expect s/he to know what you want, either.

, If you're unbalanced, there's a chance you could fall.

, For many school horses or inexperienced horses, they may not understand you're asking for a canter, not a trot. If this is the case, work on sideways movement (pushing your horse sideways with no forward movement away from the track, then back) then ask. This may help them understand what you're asking for better.

English saddles provide a closer contact with a horse's back, while a Western saddle can distribute the weight of a rider more evenly on the horse's back.Most Western saddles also have a horn in front to help with herding cattle.In general, Western saddles are deeper and more contoured than English saddles as well.


If you want to ride Western, be sure that you are using a Western saddle and not an English saddle.;
, Place the Western saddle on your horse to prepare your ride. Be sure that you place a saddle pad on your horse's back and secure all loose straps before attaching the saddle itself.Make sure the distance between your horse's elbow and the front cinch is about the width of 3 fingers to ensure a proper placement.Then you can connect the cinches and breast collar (if used) to secure your saddle.

, There are many different kinds of bridles, used for different kinds of horse activities. However, in general, a Western bridle is less complicated than an English bridle and has fewer components.Western bridles often do not have a noseband and instead have a component that fits around the horse's ears or underneath the chin.Western reins can be split or connected with a handkerchief, but all Western reins can be held with a single hand.English bridles tend to use a snaffle bit, whereas Western bridles can involve either a snaffle bit or a curb bit., When you mount the horse, sit deeply on the saddle. You should sit immediately in front of the cantle (the back of the saddle that curves upward) but not be pressed tightly against it.Sit up straight and let your legs hang freely down the sides of the horse. A properly fitting Western saddle should have the bottom of the stirrups hitting your ankle bone.It might feel more secure to sit on the cantle. However, this is uncomfortable for your horse and you should move up a couple of inches., In order to be sure that your horse is comfortable and able to interpret your signals, be sure that you have good Western riding posture. Sit up straight with your legs securely in the stirrups. (Cowboy boots can help you remain in the stirrups properly.) Keep your legs hanging straight down from your hips--do not push them forward too far. Hold your reins with the non-dominant hand and keep your other arm loose at your side. Both arms should be at lap height or so. Do not raise your arms too high., Unlike English style horses, trained Western horses work without much contact. They have bits with longer shanks which work by placing pressure on the polls, rather than their mouths. You can therefore steer with light touches from the reins with a single hand. Hold the reins with your non-dominant hand so that you can use your dominant hand for other tasks, such as tying cattle or lassoing highway robbers., Neck reining guides your horse to move in the direction you want using a gentle touch instead of a pulling motion. Think of the motion as a gentle push (in the opposite direction) instead of a pull (in the same direction). This means that if you want the horse to turn left, gently touch the right rein to the horse's neck. If you want the horse to turn right, gently touch the left rein to the horse's neck.


One helpful hint to do neck reining correctly is that you should steer your horse in the direction of the inside rein. If the left rein is inside, the horse will turn left. If the right rein is inside, the horse will turn right.The Western trained horse is always trained to move away from the direction of the rein touch.

, Western trained horses interpret even the subtlest of signals from a rider. If you look to your left and shift your hips accordingly, a trained Western horse will follow suit and turn left. English horses are steered much more actively with their reins, but if you want to ride Western, you will have to rely more on how you shift your weight and carry your body.Make sure that you do not lean your body, however. You want to remain upright and centered at all times. Use gentle shifts in your body weight to guide the horse., Both English and Western trained horses have four gaits, two of which overlap. The English gaits (from slowest to fastest) are the walk, trot, canter, and gallop. The Western gaits (from slowest to fastest) are the walk, jog, lope, and gallop.A jog is a slightly slower version of the trot, and the lope is a looser form of the canter., A walk is a slow, 4-beat natural gait. The Western walk is basically identical to an English walk. A proper walk involves the horse moving its legs forward in the following order: back left, front left, back right, front right.When you want your horse to walk, relax backwards, put your legs forward, and allow the horse to stretch its head down and out.


In English you sit tall, but in Western you should round your back out slightly to keep you in your seat and keep your horse relaxed.

, The next fastest gait is the jog, which is a 2-beat diagonal movement. A proper jog involves the horse moving its legs forward in the following order: back left and front right (simultaneously), back right and front left (simultaneously), etc.In order to get your horse to move from a walk to a jog, apply more leg pressure.


In general, a jog is a trot movement that happens to be slower and cover more ground. Like a trot, a jog must be a two-beat movement where the horse moves one pair of diagonal legs, then the other. However, you should sit deeper and back a little further in the saddle than you would for a trot.
If you like, you can post during a jog. Posting is when you move your body up and down in time with the horse's gait, and it is more common in English riding. However, there is a special posting trot in Western riding as well.Most of the time Western riders jog in the sitting position, however., Like the jog, a loping gait should be correct and flowing. It is a complicated gait, so it can take some time for your horse to learn it properly. It is a 3-beat gait in which the first beat is the outside hind leg, the second beat is the inside hind leg and outside foreleg simultaneously, and the final beat is the inside foreleg.Encourage your horse to lope by shifting your weight to the horse's outside hind leg (for the first beat) and use your leg to apply pressure to the outside of the horse.Keep it slow and controlled. If you need to shorten your reins in order to have more control, do so.

, Galloping is not necessarily a gait you will use in Western horse shows. However, if you want your horse to move at great speed, you can use a cue to encourage your horse to gallop. Depending on how you've trained your horse, you can move your hand further up the horse's neck, make a purring noise, or squeeze your legs together slightly to cue a gallop.

, Some Western trained horses can speed up and slow down using noise signals. Many riders use the ""kiss and click method,"" in which you click your tongue to ask for a jog and you smack your lips together to ask for a lope. Other horses might recognize voice commands. You can train your horse to respond to any simple sound as long as you remain consistent and ensure that the sounds do not resemble one another., Pull gently back on the reins while giving a voice command for stop, usually ""Whoa."" At the same time, apply gentle leg pressure and sit deeply in your seat to encourage your horse to slow down.Do not ever yank on the reins. That can hurt the horse's mouth, especially with a Western style bit."

Understand what causes trotting pains.,
Make sure that you use your inhaler before your lessons if you have asthma.,
Try to avoid running before you ride.,
Slow to a walk immediately if you are starting to feel the pains coming on when you are riding.

",How to Cope With Trotting Pains when Horseback Riding1," Although there are several theories, the one with the most evidence to back it up is that trotting pains occur when you forget to breathe.;
, This will open up your lung passages.

, No matter how eager you are to see your horse, you should not run. Horseback riding is one of the only sports that moves your body the same way it would be moving if you were walking or running, so running and cantering may produce the same effect.

Put out cone markers (optional).,
Start in the center of an open area.,
Canter forward and left.,
Curve right and around.,
Switch to the other leg as you pass through the center.,
Complete the second half of the eight.,
Repeat if desired.",How to Canter a Figure Eight," Imagine a figure eight shape in your practice area. Position two markers, one on either end of the figure eight. This is a useful guide for riders or horses who haven't yet learned this exercise.;
, At a show, you would start your figure eight in the center of the arena. This will be the center of the eight shape as well, where the two circles touch. Make sure you have plenty of room ahead and behind you.

, Neck rein to the right to cue the horse to canter. Let the left rein become slightly slack, so the horse can stretch his neck to begin cantering. Move forward and to the left, in a straight line.


To cue the horse to start moving or to turn, tap with your heel. Which side you use for these cues depends on how the horse was trained.
If your horse knows its cues well, you may be able to just use your foot and not pull the reins.

, After a short distance, cue your horse to turn to the right. Finish the first curve of the eight in a smooth turn. You should end up approaching your center point again, from the opposite side.


If you are using markers, circle around one of them.

, Keep cantering through the center without stopping. Neck rein to the left to cue the horse to canter on the left leg instead of the right.


Do not stop at this point, as the main purpose of the exercise is to get the horse to respond to these cues quickly. Your horse may be stressed at first, but steady practice will improve her behavior.

, You're now on the second side of the eight shape. After cantering straight ahead for a short distance, turn left in a steady circle. As before, you should turn until you face your starting point again, from the opposite side.


If using markers, circle around the second one during this motion.

, If you continue on, switch legs again when you pass through the center. Your horse may get tired or aggressive after a couple changes, so be alert for rearing or violent cantering.

Thoroughly cool down your horse!",How to Ride a Horse at a Gallop," A gentle horse is best, but make sure that your horse is in good shape to gallop. If you don't know how to tell if your horse is ready, ask your local vet.;
,


If your horse is not listening to you at each pace, stop your horse, and realize that you should not do a gallop this time, it's too dangerous.

,, Your body should be slightly leaned forward, just enough so that the wind does not hold you back.

,,, Many say that they enjoy it more than any other pace. At first it may be a little frightening, but after awhile you'll get the hang of it!

, Do not expect a horse to go straight from a gallop to a walk, go down through each pace, from the gallop, to the canter/lope, to the trot, to the walk.

, A gallop is a lot of work for horses, and though they like it, and will probably want to keep that pace, it is not good for them to gallop too much. To check for how 'hot' your horse is, stop your horse, dismount, and feel it's chest. It should be warm, but not hot. If it's still hot, then you need to cool your horse down more.

Test your horse’s ability to move away from pressure.,
Train a turn on the haunch.,
Train a turn on the forehand.,
Combine your groundwork to accomplish a grounded side pass.,
Move your horse into position.,
Open your body to create the proper lines of communication.,
Cue your horse to side pass.,
Practice the side pass at a stand still.,
Perform a side pass while walking.,
Perform a side pass at higher speeds.",How to Teach Your Horse to Side Pass," The natural instinct of your horse should be to move away from where pressure is applied - the same instinct humans have. Test this reaction in your horse by bumping them with an open palm near the girth where you would bump them with your calf. They should move away from your hand, possibly already in a side pass.


Continue bumping your horse near the girth with added pressure if they do not respond to you. As soon as they take a step away, release pressure and reward them.
Practice this until your horse needs only a single bump, or no bump at all (just pushing energy with your hand towards their girth), in order to move away from you.;
, Put your horse on a lead rope, and if necessary grab a crop. Stand so that your body is positioned slightly behind the barrel of your horse’s body, and gesture with your arm or crop towards their shoulder. If they do not respond to this, then apply pressure on their shoulder. The goal is to get them to move away from your pressure by rotating their body around their back legs.


If your horse turns away or simply walks in the opposite direction rather than crossing their front legs in a turn, grab the lead rope and hold them straight ahead.
As soon as your horse crosses their front legs in a turn on the haunch, release pressure, drop your eyes, and reward them for doing what you asked.
Continue practicing a turn on the haunch on the ground, so that your horse will respond to the same cues when riding.

, Similar to a turn on the haunch, a turn on the forehand is done when your horse rotates their entire body around their front legs by crossing their back legs. Accomplish this by standing near the shoulder (to block shoulder/forward movement) and gesturing towards the haunch with your crop or open hands. If they don’t respond without pressure, add a bit by pushing against the haunch with your open hands, or tapping them with the crop.


Don’t remove pressure if your horse simply backs away or turns to the side. Straighten them out if necessary, but continue bumping with pressure until they take at least one step by crossing their legs.
As soon as your horse achieves a single step in a turn on the forehand, release pressure and reward them for following your cues.
Practice this over and over until your horse requires a minimal amount of pressure to accomplish a turn on the forehand.

, Stand next to your horse near the barrel of their body, using a crop if necessary. Bump the girth of the horse to tell them to move away; if they don’t move how you want, give them the cues for a turn on the haunch and a turn on the forehand. Continue working back and forth between your cues until your horse clues in and does at least a single successful step in a side pass.


Reward your horse and release pressure as soon as they take even a single step in the form of a side pass.
Continue doing this until they don’t need to be cued for a turn on the forehand and a turn on the haunch in order to recreate a side pass. Eventually they should only need to be bumped on their side near the girth.

, When starting to teach a side pass from the saddle, it is easiest to move to a location where your horse won’t mistake your one-sided bump as a cue to move forward. Therefore, move your horse so that they are facing a fence or a wall. This will allow them only movement to the side or in reverse.

, Your body language is what tells your horse what you’re asking, so in order to get what you want from your horse, you need to practice as well. If you’re side passing to the left, lift your left leg to release pressure and lift the left reign up and out slightly to open movement towards the left. You will apply pressure on your right side.


To side pass to the right, reverse these cues so the right side of your body is open and you apply pressure on your left side.

, With one side of your body open, move your opposite leg forward and bump your horse with your calf near the girth. Make sure you keep the opposite side of your body open as you do this. Continue bumping with added pressure if necessary, and then stop as soon as your horse takes at least a single step in a side pass. Reward your horse as soon as they manage this.

, Continue using the same cueing patterns you’ve taught your horse to get them to side pass. Do this for a while against a wall or a fence until your horse has it down, and then move to an open area and do it again. Practice until your horse can sidestep several feet in both directions in an open area.

, The moving side pass is in theory the same as a stand-still seated side pass, the only difference is more pressure is put on the rider to perform the cues correctly. Follow the same aforementioned directions, but as your horse walks cue the side pass by bumping their side at the same time their barrel moves in the direction of the side pass. The barrel of the horse swings back and forth as they walk, so there will be a break between bumps rather than constant pressure.


Performing a side pass while walking requires more attention as well, as the horse can more easily get away with simply turning instead of side passing.
Have a friend or trainer stand on the ground and give feedback on your body language and your horse’s reactions.

, When you feel you have perfected the side pass in both directions at the walk, cue your horse into a trot and eventually a canter and cue the side pass. This gets increasingly difficult for the rider, but the horse should respond the same. Just remember to time the leg-bumps near the girth with the swing of the barrel.


It may be helpful to perform a half-halt before cueing the side pass when you are doing so at a trot or canter."

Prepare to canter your horse.,
Ask your horse to canter.,
Keep your seat in.,
Establish a good canter.,
Maintain a canter by pushing forward.,
Check your horse’s pace.,
Work on your lope departure.,
Maintain proper lope technique.Your body should be able to sit deeper than when riding at a canter, as the bounce should now be gone.,
Lope for a good few laps.,
Keep practicing.,
Ask someone to observe you.",How to Lope (Western Canter)," The lope builds off a canter, so you have to canter first. The canter, a three-beat gait, comes easily to some horses and riders but not to others. To canter your horse, you must be relaxed in the saddle, and be sure not to have your stirrups too short. Some common issues with cantering include too much rigidity, particularly in the lower back, bouncing in the saddle, and trying to keep too much control with your knees.Sit tall and don’t lean forward
Keep your seat in the saddle
Have your weight on your heels
The reins are light in your hands -- your horse should not be pulling;
, Your horse needs to respond to a series of cues that you give each time you want to canter. If your first effort doesn’t succeed -- don’t worry. Many horses take a while to figure out exactly what you want them to do.For a left lead, you need to softly close your right hand around the outside rein.
Do a steady squeeze and release on the inside rein using your left hand.
Use your inner left leg to add pressure.
This is asking your horse to get ready to canter.
Have your right leg back behind the girth.
When you are ready to start cantering, move your right leg in front of the girth and give a gentle bump.

, All riding revolves around your seat (bottom). You use it to stop, to go and to turn, as well as to back, side pass -- essentially everything involved in riding. When you lope, your seat is what keeps you in. Because the lope is a slower pace, it is seen as smoother, but when you are on the horse for the first time at a lope, it may seem a little bouncy., The pace will be forward and moving, but will be easy enough to slow down as necessary. Try placing a few poles in your riding area, spaced far enough apart so that you can keep a canter going over each and around. You will soon notice that after a few laps your horse has settled into an established canter of 3 footfalls. This is the very first step to getting a horse to lope. A horse needs to be traveling at the correct speed and have the correct footfalls to be able to slow and handle the required pace., If your horse tires, then come back to a trot, which is slower than a canter, and let him settle and rest. Then return to a canter as your horse gains back energy. If your horse proceeds, you can start to get a lope., Squeeze the reins one at a time and slightly sit deeper -- imagine you are a sack of potatoes for this exercise. Squeeze your legs onto your horse. This will encourage your horse to pause slightly, which is the tool to get them to slow. When you get a slight pause, release your legs slightly while maintaining a forward leg pressure. Release your hands also and move him into the stride. Repeat this step about three or 4 times until you have a slow canter, or lope., When moving from a walk or jog to a lope, lift your hand slightly. At the same time you squeeze with your outside leg, ask the horse to flex a little to the inside. Do this as you are pushing your horse in the direction you want. It’s at that point that you will ask your horse to go into a lope. You can do this a couple of ways:


You can add more pressure from your leg or your spur
You can combine either leg pressure or spur pressure with a sound, The bounce will have been replaced with a soft seat, with a slight elevation of the legs in mid-suspension. This is hard to feel as you start out, but as you improve you will be able to feel the suspension. All of this is in your legs -- your reins need to be loose., Then take a break by trotting or walking your horse. Begin the steps above again to allow your horse to practice getting into the gait. As you advance in your loping ability you will be able to see a huge improvement in your horse’s posture, as well as his awareness of your riding and a faster response to your commands for lope.

, Like any new skill, your horse needs time to master loping. Each stride will have three footfalls, but should be a slower and more relaxed pace. As your lope becomes maintained and correct, you will be able to proceed to getting your horse to lower its head and be suitable for a western class., Even if you think that you have loping down, it’s best to get someone to watch you and your horse to make sure it’s all working as you hope. Sometimes it’s obvious to an outside observer that you need to make a small change in order to become truly proficient at loping."

Prepare your horse for the ride.,
Warm him up.,
Dismount and tie your horse for a moment.,
To set up the course, begin with the poles.,
To weave the poles, start at one end of the line and simply steer your horse so he goes between the poles.,
The barrels are to practice barrel racing.,
After that, it's time for the jump(s).,
After your horse is finished jumping, it's time for a trail ride.,
When you get back from your trail ride, untack your horse.",How to Exercise Your Horse's Talents (Western Riding)," First, catch him and lead him to a hitching post. If he is wearing a blanket, take it off. Now, groom him. Do this by brushing him, picking out his hooves, and combing his mane and tail. Now, tack him up. Make sure you get the girth tight! If your horse dislikes being bridled, you may need some help.
Before you ride, you may want to join up with him. Pet him, talk to him calmly, and let him know you love him. This is a great chance to bond with him. As soon as you are ready, mount up and ride!;
, Take him to the arena and walk him in circles. After a few laps around, begin doing figure eights and spirals (moving in a circular motion and making your circles smaller and smaller), still at the walk. Turn him in the reverse direction and begin trotting. Repeat the previous exercises at the trot. Bring him back down to a walk, then halt him. After a few seconds, bring him back to the trot and ask for a lope. Repeat the exercises again. Bring him down to a trot, reverse directions, walk him, and halt again. Quick note: You don't have to follow all the warm-up steps exactly, they are just a suggested plan. Decide what works best for you. Now that your horse is warmed up and ready to go, get ready for some real riding.

, Remember, never tie a horse by the reins! Once he is secure, gather the materials you will need for your course. You will need:


At least three barrels or large boxes
Six poles
Several fence boards or long, skinny pieces of wood
Two cinder blocks or bricks per board

, Line up the poles along one of the long sides of the rectangular arena. They should be about three yards apart. Save plenty of room at the end and beginning of the line.


Now for the barrels. If you plan to barrel race, they should be set in a triangular pattern. Take two of the barrels down to one of the short ends of the arena. This will be your starting point. set the barrels across from each other on opposite sides of the arena, setting the barrel on the right slightly closer to you. Remember to leave some space between the barrels and the edge of the arena. Now, drag the remaining barrel between the two other ones. Set it down several yards behind the other barrels, directly in the middle. The barrel racing course should resemble a triangle.
Next, you will set up some small jumps. Although most western horses are not trained to jump, all horses have the ability. This part of your course will really test your horse's skill and his trust in you. Assembling the jumps is very easy. Simply set up two cinder blocks or bricks and lay a board on top of them. Make sure they are on the opposite side of the arena as the poles. The jump should be no more than four inches tall, if your horse has never jumped before. If you decide to build multiple jumps, leave lots of room between them. To show your jumping range and warn the horse of the approaching jump, place a barrel on the opposite side of the jump as the fence. The barrel and the fence are your boundaries.
Now, get back on your horse and prepare to ride the course. Depending on how long it took you to set up the course, you may need to warm up again.

, You don't need to yank on his head for the turns, just slightly move your hand, and he should respond. Once you can do this at the walk, try the trot, then the lope. The object is to weave quickly without knocking the poles over. If done correctly, you will feel the horse twisting under you. Even if your horse messes up or knocks over the poles, stay confident and keep trying!

, Before you attempt to run the course, practice on the computer. The following link will take you to a game where you will learn the course: Barrel Blast at Horsecity.com
To run the course, begin at the starting point. Remember to barrel race safely! Get your horse walking and head for the barrel on the right. Go around it on the left. Now approach the second barrel, which should be next to the first one. Go around it on the right side and head for the third, and final, one. Go around this one on the right and go between the other two barrels until you reach the place where you started. When you are going back to the starting point after you circle the last barrel, pick up speed. This is called the homestretch. Once you can do it at the walk, try the trot, then the lope. After doing this exercise, your horse may get excited and maybe even out of control. To get through the next activity, you will need to get him under control

, It is best to jump your horse at the trot or a slow lope, because if you do it at the walk, he will just step over the jump like it's a twig. Ask for a trot and head straight for the jump. Unlike English riding, you are not required to shorten the reins, rise into three-point, etc. That is hard to do in a Western saddle, and it will only confuse your horse. If he has never jumped before, he may try to avoid the fence, so make sure you keep him in line. Try not to flop forward and hit the horn when he jumps, as this is painful. If he knocks it over, don't get mad, just dismount and set it back up. Keep trying until he has jumped it at least three times. Every time he makes it over, pat him and tell him how great he is.

, This is not required, but it is a good way to reward and relax the horse and cool off. Remember to stay safe.

, If he is really sweaty, which he should be after a workout like that, give him a quick bath. If, for some reason, he isn't very hot, just give him a good grooming. Remember, it is very important that your horse is properly cooled down. You may also need to calm him down a bit. Once you're done, turn him out in his paddock or put him in his stall.

Learn about the career.,
Work on your skill set.,
Start off in high school.,
Get a relevant education.,
Look for early work experience through linking programs.,
Engage in good farming practices.",How to Be a Cowboy1," Before you decide to become a rancher, spend some time learning a bit about the career. A career in ranching can make you feel like something of a modern day cowboy. If you love the outdoors and animals, it could be a great career path for you.


A rancher's job is to look over land and animals on a large farm property. Ranchers can own their own farm and can also work for other farm owners. The life of a rancher can be exciting due to its unplanned nature. Every day presents unique challenges and opportunities depending on season, animal temperament, weather, and other factors.As a rancher, you'll spend a lot of time outdoors. You may have to travel a lot as well, but will see a lot of beautiful countryside across the United States. If you love traveling and the outdoors, this could be a great career for you.Salary can be tricky when it comes to a rancher. Your annual salary will fluctuate based on the current market and how much a given farm makes in a year. A bad season can mean financial setbacks. Traditional benefits, like healthcare, are not usually offered for ranchers. These are factors to consider before committing yourself to the life.In recent years, the outlook for rancher as a career has been getting worse. Keep in mind you may make less money the more time you spend working on a ranch.;
, To be a rancher, you'll need analytical skills, critical thinking skills, interpersonal skills, and mechanical skills. Start working on these early on.


Analytical skills are useful for managing a farm and ranch. Taking on leadership positions and college courses in marketing and management can help. You'll also need critical thinking skills as you'll have to make decisions regarding livestock. Seeking out management positions, even for unrelated fields, can help hone your critical thinking skills as problem solving is a key component to management.Interpersonal skills are important. Seek out experience in customer service and other jobs where you have to work with people. Take a summer job at a call center, for example. Networking with other ranchers and making deals with farmers is a key component of ranching, so interpersonal communication is key.Mechanical skills are also vital. Work on a local farm and ask for the opportunity to learn how equipment works. Take an internship or apprenticeship with a local mechanic., Many people who go on to become ranchers are born into the life. Oftentimes, their parents or grandparents worked on farms. If this is not the case for you, you can still become a rancher but should seek out experience working on farms and with animals early on in high school.


Stock up on science related classes in high school. While there's no specific educational path to become a rancher, having knowledge of animal biology can certainly help your chances of success. You should also take food and consumer studies courses to learn about agriculture, food production, and other aspects of farming.Start gaining experience working with animals. Volunteer on a local farm. Join 4H. Take horseback riding lessons. Anything that builds relevant, hands-on experience with farm work can help you build your resume for a career as a rancher., As stated, there is no specific career path for becoming a rancher. However, if you're serious about the career some secondary education can help. Some of the following degree paths might prove relevant for a career as a rancher:


A four-year degree in food studies, agriculture, biology, or other fields related to farming and farm studies can help.An associate's degree or apprenticeship might also be a good option if you don't want to dedicate four years to school. Depending on your location, you may be able to enroll in a program that specifically focuses on ranching and farm work. Ask around at local farms or talk to your school counselor about your plans.Many land-grant or state universities offer beginning farming programs. They're not a full 4-year degree but provide you with a relevant certification., If you're just starting out, look into working for retiring farmers. As many farmers are retiring in the coming decade, a lot of ranchers start out through linking programs. These are programs that connect new ranchers with retiring farmers.


The US government has some beginning farming and ranching programs you could look into. This would be a great place to start gaining experience.Linking programs are listed on the Center for Rural Affairs website. This can help you find linking programs in your area and match you with ranchers who share your ethics.Even if you do not end up staying in the program long term, doing some work for various linking programs can help build your resume and allow you to gain valuable experience., Once you're an established rancher, work on practicing good farming. Always stay up to day with the latest and most innovative techniques and talk to other ranchers about how you can improve.


Be a steward of the resources around you. Make sure you take care of land you work on and engage in in environmentally friendly farming techniques.
If you're working with a herd of livestock, use preventative health plans. Vaccinate calves against contagious diseases and watch for the signs of seasonal colds and flus. Quarantine animals showing early signs of sickness.
Make sure all the livestock in a herd get enough food. Some animals may to slow or weak and get cut off from a food source. Always monitor animals to make sure they're at the proper weight.
Buy quality but inexpensive materials. Network with other farmers to keep track of where to get the best hay, riding supplies, and other ranching materials for a low cost without sacrificing quality."

Join an organization.",How to Be a Cowboy2," Most people who work in rodeos were born into their field. Their parents were affiliated with the rodeo and they learned the trade from there. Even if you were not born into a rodeo family, it's important to be involved in rodeo culture from an early age.


Attend rodeos and see if you can volunteer. Just working as a farmhand can help as you'll get a sense of the scene., Try to learn some basic skills. Learning how to rope, ride a horse, and other skills are important if you want to become a rodeo cowboy. Taking horseback riding lessons can help you develop a basic riding skill set., Being a rodeo cowboy is a physically demanding job. You'll need strength, stamina, and agility to successfully work in a rodeo. Build up your muscles and endurance as you move towards your career goal.


Join a gym and make use of weight training equipment, like weight machines and elliptical machines. Talk to a trainer at the gym to get your current fitness level evaluated. If you start out pushing yourself too hard, you could end up with an injury that could compromise your career.
Try to work on endurance as well. Take up running, jogging, biking, or other activities where you have to be physically active for a long time.

, As a rodeo cowboy, you'll need to have experience riding a horse. You need to have a certain mastery over horseback riding so work on taking lessons.


If possible, start at a young age. Take horseback riding lessons at a local farm or ranch.
Practice all aspects of riding: jumping, barrel racing, western, english, side saddle. As a rodeo rancher a lot of your job is to entertain so you'll need to have a diverse skill set on hand.A good horse is also important. Many rodeo cowboys say having a good horse under them makes or breaks a career. Pay attention to how you bond with each horse your ride and how well that horse responds to your signals., While not as common as other training and apprenticeship programs, there are some rodeo training programs throughout the country. If you're really dedicated to a career in rodeo work considering enrolling in a training program. You can find lists of programs online or ask the cowboys at a local rodeo if they engaged in any professional training.

, Once you feel skilled enough to hit the rodeo, begin to build your repertoire. Begin to book gigs at a variety of rodeos so you'll have a performance listing to give out as your move forward in your career.


You might have to start small. Sign up for low stakes events and competitions at local rodeos. If you're successful and begin winning competitions, you'll begin moving up in the ranks.Practice. Daily practice and hard work is what will ultimately determine your success as a rodeo cowboy. You'll need to focus on using much of your spare time improving before you're established.Look into 4H rodeos. Many 4H's host low stake rodeo events. This would be a great opportunity to start off and gain some experience.

, There are a variety of professional rodeo organizations you could join to improve your chance of finding regular work. Organizations like the Southern Rodeo Association, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, the American Professional Rodeo Association, and more are excellent organizations to join. Membership requirements and fees vary from place to place. Browse the websites of organizations you're interested in for more information.

Make sure you have the correct gear!,
Get your horse fit and properly schooled.,
Start low and easy the first time you ride cross country.,
Work on your own form, too.,
Get feedback.,
Be patient.,
Be firm with your horse if he is uneasy.,
Deal with falls if they occur.,
Be confident!,
Enjoy yourselves!",How to Ride Cross Country on Your Horse," This is very important because cross country can be dangerous if you take a fall, or your horse could injure himself. Look in the ""Things You'll Need"" section to check out what you must wear for cross country, and what to equip your horse with. Research the equipment needed if you've never heard of them before. They must be fitted.;
, This is important because you need to have a fit horse to take you round such a big course of jumps. Work on the basics: schooling, controlling your horse on trail rides, road work/ hill work, jumping etc.


Try to ride as much as you can and get your horse fit. It's best to give your horse at least one day off work a week, and also a day of trail riding so your horse can relax and have fun. Road work can also strengthen their legs for jumping, as well as hill work, which can also strengthen their hind quarters. Create a training schedule for your horse.
You can also practise going over fallen logs and natural objects on trails.

, For example, small logs, log piles, tyre jumps and wooden cross rails. This will allow your horse to get the idea of it, and if you start off by going around a big course of advanced jumps, you could injure yourselves.


Practise a smaller course of jumps first; don't try jumping everything the first time.

, You need to work with your horse to make you both comfortable as you start cross-country riding.


Go into two-point position when cantering/galloping to enable him a free, forward and relaxed pace. You don't want him to feel like there's a bag of potatoes on his back.
Don't hold your reins so tight! Keep your hands firm but soft, and give your horse enough room for his neck to stretch over.

, Have someone with you as you practise riding and start cross country. A trainer would be ideal. They know how you ride and will be able to give you a lot of advice.

, If your horse doesn't like the look of one of the jumps, eg. water jumps, then work with them. Don't start getting frustrated. It will come in time, and patience. Slowly introduce a scary jump to them and take it in steps, instead of forcing him to go over it. We wouldn't want to be forced to do something that we were terrified of, so the horses shouldn't have to either.

, If your horse feels like he's going to run out, keep your leg on and give him a tap with the whip on his neck on the side he's trying to run out on. Keep your leg on and use your voice.


Your horse may get over excited/ scared and bolt- keep still and deep in the saddle, don't start tugging on the reins or he'll get even more spooked. If it's safe to, just let him keep galloping, and stop him when he's gotten a bit further, so it's like you've just taken him for a gallop. If it's necessary, turn him into a circle to slow him down.

, If you fall, roll out of the way of your horse and keep your head tucked in.


To help avoid falls, check the cross country jump hasn't been knocked and damaged before you jump. It could be boggy on the other side, which could result in injury.

, Trust your horse; otherwise he'll lack confidence. Use your leg and create energy, and encourage him to go forward in a nice steady pace.

, Cross country is very fun for both you and your horse, so be positive and confident.

Relax - Horses can sense if you're scared or nervous.,
The Approach - When approaching a jump, keep your horse straight.,
Tempo - Keep your horse in a flowing tempo that is under control.,
Posture & Two-Point - Sit up during the course.,
After the Jump - While you are in mid-air of a jump, look to your next jump and start giving your horse the signal with your legs to go that direction.",How to Keep a Horse Under Control While Jumping," Take deep breaths while riding and slump a little in your seat. Sit back, feel and look calm; not stiff and nervous. Remember to make nice wide turns in hunter classes. If you look calm in a show, the judge will see that and you receive higher marks.;
, Try not to let it pull to the side. If the horse starts to shy away from the jump and you can feel it, then really sit deep in your seat and use your hips to push and your legs to squeeze the horse on. When your legs squeeze the horse on, don't use one continuous squeeze, you squeeze, then relax, squeeze, relax.

, Start by counting out loud the rhythm. If trotting, then count 1, 2, 1, 2 for each stride the horse takes. If cantering, then count 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 each stride the horse takes. Do this for the whole course. If the rhythm changes, then fix it accordingly. When you find the right tempo the course flows beautifully. There always seems to be one direction that a horse goes faster, so be prepared to work harder one direction to keep a good tempo. Use check and release to slow them down, if needed. Check and release is when you pull the reins back slightly, but then give the reins back. Don't pull for more than a second and then relax the reins. Tempo is important because you don't want your horse to chip or stumble over a jump. Tempo allows the horse to find the right take-off spot for a jump, and then they won't knock down a rail. Soon your eye will be trained to see how many strides need to fit between jumps and tempo will be familiar to you. You won't need to count out loud anymore once this is accomplished.

, On some courses, you are asked to be in a half seat, or leaning forward slightly, but certain horses take this to mean ""go faster."" Practice full seat and half seat. Keep your hands down near the horse's neck. Don't look at the ground or the jump, look forward. Now for two-point. One of the most important rules about two-point is that you don't go up too early. If you go up too early and the horse refuses then you could fall over their neck. if you go up too late then the horse may jump and you will be left behind therefore pulling on the horse's mouth. Get into your two-point just as the horse's front hooves leave the ground. Put your hands about halfway up the neck. Keep your heels down. Don't let your legs slide backwards.

, If your horse was speedy to the last jump, then don't stay in two-point as long over that jump. Sit down and use a check and release right as their front hooves touch the ground. Sit down in your seat. Keep the tempo.

Understand that it is in horse's nature to run away from anything suspicious or scary.,
Start low.,
Show your horse the fence before you try to make him/her jump it.,
Use a controlled gait.,
Do not stress or get frustrated.",How to Train Your Horse to Jump Solid Fences," And a solid fence or small wall can very well be scary. Therefore, be aware of your horse's ears, as they will show you when (s)he is scared (they will be pointing backwards), and when (s)he is about to try and escape.
, Even if you usually jump quite high (say for example 1 metre), start with a way smaller solid fence (in this example, 0'6 metres), so that the horse will feel more confident. Keep practicing with the small solid fence until you notice that your horse is no longer afraid of it, and jumps it naturally. Then, you may move to a larger one., That is to say, as you are starting to warm up your horse, you can walk by the fence a couple times, forcing the horse to look at it, and smelling it if possible. This way, (s)he will get used to it faster., When approaching the solid fence, always keep a steady but controlled rhythm since the horse is quite likely to refuse the fence. Leaning slightly backwards and holding the reins tightly will also help encourage your horse to jump, and will help you not to fall if the horse happens to refuse to jump. When you are about two or three metres away from the fence, you may also press your heels against the horse, to push him/her forwards and encourage (s)he to jump., It may take some time before your horse learns to jump solid fences. Perseverance and patience are the keys to success!"

Begin by setting up the course.,
Set the rest of the poles in a straight line going down the middle of the arena.,
Warm up.,
Get off your horse and tighten your cinch.,
Remount and introduce your horse to the poles at a walk.,
Tell your horse to gallop.,
Head for the first pole.,
After weaving the last pole, make a sharp turn and do the same thing going the other way.

,
When you get to the end of the set, turn your horse and slow him down gradually by taking him around the arena in circles.

,
Congratulate yourself and give your horse the praise he deserves.

",How to Polebend," You will need six poles, about six or seven feet tall, with sturdy bases. Set the first one in the middle of the arena, about six yards from the fence/wall. You can also use cones, barrels, etc., though it is best to use actual western equipment if you plan on teaching this and performing at shows (that way your horse knows the set up best).;
, You should be able to take about 7 steps (on foot, not horseback) between each pole. If you're less than about 4 and 1/2 feet tall, it's more like 11 steps. Make sure they are in line with each other.

, Especially if you and your horse are new to this, it is important to get the horse moving and get you in rhythm. Warm up by walking, trotting, and loping your horse around in circles.

, You will find that often it has loosened itself up after your warm up, and your horse is more relaxed. Make sure that you can slide two fingers under your cinch; if it is not tight enough there is a large chance that you will not be able to stay on as easily.

, When you go around the poles, you should stay about four feet away. Remember to start on your horse's best lead (if you are unsure what this is talk to a professional for help). Don't forget to use your leg cues, too! As you are going around the pole, use your other leg to switch the lead your horse is on.

, Take him around the ring once or twice.

, When the pole is next to your leg, ask for a turn (your horse is moving so fast that, by the time he gets the signal, it will be time to turn).

,,,"
"
Place four poles on the ground.,
Check to make sure that the striding is right for your pony.

,
Warm up.,
Start by doing 10 minutes of walking, then 15 minutes of trotting, then 5 minutes of cantering.

,
Practice doing serpentines and figure eights.

,
Use a walk, then trot, then canter to go cautiously over the poles.,
Raise one of the poles a tiny bit.,
Place two poles into a small cross pole.,
Walk up to the jump but this time a bit faster, with your leg on.,
Repeat in trot.,
Do not go into canter yet.,
Don't forget to end on a good note.,

,, Get your pony on the bit.

,,, Repeat until your pony is confident and going over without hesitation.


Be prepared for anything. Keep your leg on and look ahead.

, Repeat the walk, trot, canter over it until the pony is confident with each approach.

, Then walk up to the jump and let your pony look at it, to become familiar with what it will shortly jump.

, Your pony may hesitate but speak softly to encourage and reassure it that what you are doing is okay. Be prepared for it to leap or stop.

, Always remember that this is scary for your pony––it's new and daunting. Anything could happen and it's as if you're suddenly jumping off the monkey bars––you'd hesitate and find it scary at first too.

, Give it a few more tries jumping fillers and coloured poles.


Keep the jump on cross poles but change the height. Do not try spreads or combinations yet, as your pony is not used to having to stride and pace itself at this stage.

, Pat your pony and praising it. Always cool down effectively, on a long rein.

, Give it a treat, acknowledging that the pony did a brave thing for you. However the exercise went, the pony still tried to please you.

First, make sure you are comfortable with all the gaits in a saddle, and in bareback which include the walk, the trot, sitting trot, and canter.,
Make sure your horse is warmed up.,
Ask your horse to canter on flat, level ground.,
When you are relaxed and your horse is collected, ask for the gallop by squeezing with both legs, and keep your legs against the horse so the horse doesn't quit on you.,
Remember not to slam on your horse's back.

,
Your pelvis should be moving with your horse in a scooping motion.,
Have fun galloping bareback on your horse!

",How to Gallop Bareback," You must also be comfortable with your horse.;
, Never start off with the canter in the ring. That is just asking for trouble, and for your horse to be overworked.

, Be sure to always inspect the ground for holes, dips, etc. before you canter. Nothing worse than having your horse trip in a hole, and you falling off the horses neck.

, You should be leaning slightly forward and be moving with your horse. If your horse has an uncomfortable gait, it is ok to slightly lean back, almost as if sitting on your pockets (also think of the dressage canter;scoop forward with your pelvis). You'll know he's galloping by the distinct 4-beat thump, thump, thump, thump. He'll also be going very fast, but do not panic. If you panic, the horse will panic too.

,, Do not try to go against your horse's motion, or you will fall off! When in doubt, relax, and let your body go with the motion of your horse.

"
Begin with single poles spaced out around an even land in your riding school.,
Use aids to guide your horse over them, letting your horse move his neck around and look at the poles.

,
Change your direction from time to time.

,
Once your horse is used to the poles, ride over them at a rising trot.

,
Keep at an even pace, and concentrate on your rhythm and impulsion.,
Try this in forward Position too.

",How to Do Pole Work with a Horse1,";
,,,, Don't look down or back at the poles, or you may lose your balance.

,"
"
Once you can trot over single poles, try a row of three.

,
Never use two- your horse may think he is meant to jump the pole like a fence.

,
When you can trot over 3 poles, add more, one at a time, until you have a row of six.",How to Do Pole Work with a Horse2,",,


The way in which you space your poles depends on the length of your horse's stride. The table below shows Trotting pole distances.
All you need to know is the height of your horse or pony

up to 12.2hh= 1.05m (3.6ft)
12.2hh-14.2hh=1.20(4ft)
14.2hh- 16.2hh=1.35m (4.6ft)
over 16.2hh= 1.50m (5ft)



"
"
To make the exercise harder, raise the poles slightly by putting blocks under alternate ends.,
Once you feel happy riding over raised poles in your normal position, try it in forward position.

,
Don't try to do it too many times in a row, and end each session while your horse is going well.

Seek the guidance of an experienced rider or instructor to supervise your foray into bareback riding.,
Understand that it is important to try this on the right horse.,
Focus on where you want to go with your eyes.,
Look, leg, rein.,
Keep your legs in the same riding position you would if you had stirrups.

,
Learn to ride balanced at a walk, trot, and canter in a saddle but without the stirrups.,
Consider using a bareback pad, but choose one without stirrups.,
Again, ride as you would normally.,
Use a stirrup leather without the stirrups, strapped around the base of the horse's neck, to hold onto if you feel you may lose your balance.,
Use just a halter/head collar to ride.,
Sit forward on the horse.,
When you trot, be stiff.",How to Ride a Horse Bareback," Also, build up your leg muscle before you try bareback, especially your thighs, this will help keep you safe and make the ride easier. Do this by practicing 2-point position and posting.;
, Some horses throw you up higher than others. A smooth-gaited horse with a broad back and low withers is ideal (although a horse with good-sized withers is ideal for going downhill). Be careful of horses that startle easily; if it's your first time riding bareback you may not be able to stay safe if your horse decides to rear.

, Do not look down at your horse or you may become unbalanced.

, Before you use the reins to ask for a turn, turn your head to look where you want to go. Horses are very sensitive, and when you turn your head part of your torso will turn as well, and the horse will feel it. Once you have looked, use your legs to reinforce the balance-shift signal you've already given the horse. After following this step, use the rein if needed. (An experienced horse feeling you look and/or use your leg will likely start the motions before you've even moved the reins!)

,, Have your instructor walk or lunge with you at first so that you can focus on balancing. Start at a walk and stay there for several days before trying anything faster. Practice for short periods of 15 minutes or less.

, A regular saddle has a rigid frame that keeps it from sliding under the horses belly when you put pressure in a stirrup. Using a bareback pad will still help get you used to riding without a saddle, because it gives you a better grip than the horses bare back would. Choose a bareback pad that you're comfortable with, as long as it doesn't have stirrups. But, what's the point of bareback if its not ""Bare"" back.

, Your calves should touch the horse's sides but not apply pressure.

, Alternatively, you can rely on the horse's mane, which will not hurt it. Whatever you do, do not use the reins to regain your balance, as that will upset and/or confuse the horse.

, This can sometimes confuse a horse, so simply loop it through the other side of the head collar to create a 'bridle' feel. This also allows the horse to have a free mouth, and not to be so rigid.

, Right by the withers. When you canter bareback, relax your legs, sit back a little and let your body rock with the movement of the horse.

, Sit up straight and make a grip with your thighs.

If your horse is feeling up to it, you may want to add a bounce or a grid.

,
When your horse/pony feels up to you can put the jump up or add more challenges such as spreads, fillers, gates, waters, etc.

,
If you want a real challenge then you can try to get your horse going over the jumps in course, without blocks.",How to Free Jump a Horse/Pony," You will need to set up the jump A) Along the fence. Or B) In the middle. However if you have an outdoor arena make sure your jump is smaller than the arena fence. If it is bigger, the horse might get confused and jump out of the arena!;
, The blocks mean your horse has a better chance of jumping the fence straight.

, This pole is used both as a guide and warm up jump. You can place wings on either side of your jump, but make sure any wings you use do not have cups attached. (These are a safety hazard)

, Your horse should be groomed, as if you are going to ride, but should not be tacked up. You can either exercise your horse in a headcollar or an in-hand bridle (A bridle with the reins taken off)

, Lunging the horse allows you to warm them up safely as when you remove the lunge line your control is limited.

, Take your horse/pony by the halter/bridle up to the pole. A few feet away let go of your horse/pony. Urge your pony over the pole with hands, voice and only if needed a whip. You may want to lead them over first, if your horse is young or nervous.

, Remember to start with a cross pole and gradually work upward.

You should also lean forward while lifting yourself.Getting yourself into position should happen quickly, basically as the horse is changing from his final stride into a jumping position. You will be learning to do this transition so it takes you only a few seconds.;
, As you lift yourself, your weight should shift to the balls of your feet. This movement should come naturally as you rise in the saddle and move forward., It may be tempting to ride this position with your heels up. However, you need to keep your heels down, putting your full weight in the stirrups. In addition, make sure to bend your leg slightly. This keeps your leg from moving backwards too much. If your leg moves backwards too much, it can make your horse go too fast., That is, you need to push your hands up the horse's neck a bit from where you normally keep your hands. Some riders even grab the horses mane. Moving your hands gives your horse a chance to really stretch out his neck as he takes the jump., It can be difficult to learn the proper position in the heat of the moment. Every jump only provides a little bit of time to get into position. Therefore, try practicing in front of a mirror at home. You can also practice on your horse when he is trotting or cantering to get a feel for the position.Basically, as soon as you get the feel for how to shift your weight, you can start trying it in the saddle.

, If you've never jumped a horse before, try using a neck strap. If you don't, you may jerk back on the reins at the wrong time, pulling the bit hard into the horse's mouth., As you turn to take a jump, you must make sure the horse is in the correct position to take it. In other words, the horse needs to take it dead on, directly in the center, rather than slanted or off to the side.Part of lining up the horse properly means you are sitting up and looking straight at the jump, which helps to push the horse in the proper direction., You shouldn't be putting any weight on your hands as you prepare to take a jump. Also, make sure you are not holding the reins too tightly, giving your horse freedom to move his head., As you feel the horse prepare for the jump, you must get into position, detailed in the previous section. Remember, you also must keep your leg around the horse, or else you could fall off. Also, look forward as you take the jump, not downward., As the horse jumps, lean forward even more. Leaning forward helps you maintain your balance on the horse, as it shifts your weight., You only return to your normal position as the horse lands from the jump. During the jump, stay in this position.As he lands, transition back into normal position as he transitions back into his stride. It should take about the same amount of time.


During this time, you should keep contact with the reins and the horse's head, but let the horse balance himself as he will. Also, you can keep one leg in the jumping position as you head to the next gate., Now that you've come out of the jump, it's time to be looking for the next one. Once again, make sure to approach it head on, rather to the side., Bouncing is when you set up a series of small fences in rapid succession. Start with two at first. The idea is the horse never goes back into regular strides between fence. Therefore, you must stay in the proper position for jumping the whole time, giving you and the horse practice., It's important to look ahead through the jump. For one thing, it helps you plan ahead for the next jump. For another, shifting your head can shift your whole body. That can throw the horse off, which in turn can make you lose your balance., While you generally canter a horse in competition, starting the horse on trotting helps acclimate him to jumping. It also helps him learn how to jump the best way, meaning leaning back on his hocks before he takes the jump., One of the best ways to teach your horse not to refuse a jump is to start with very small jumps. That way, the horse can jump it even if he stops in front of it. If you let him walk away and come back to it, you're only telling him he can refuse a jump at will.For instance, you can start with just rails on the ground.Another way to introduce a horse to jumping is trail logs. Because they're round, there's less chance the horse will hurt himself.In addition, let him jump in the way he feels like when he first starts jumping. That is, he's inexperienced and will not be jumping properly yet. In time, he will learn, but in the meantime, still try to get into position as he jumps. In addition, try using a neck strap to help you stay on the horse., Anytime you introduce your horse to something new, it helps to have an older horse around to show him what to do. Horses follow other horses' lead, so once the young horse sees the older horse do it, he'll be willing to give it a try., Introduce higher jumps and trick jumps over time. However, every time you start, review what you've recently taught the horse to solidify it in his memory., If a horse starts refusing jumps, it's usually because of the rider. The rider may be inexperienced and not approaching the jump correctly, meaning the horse feels like he can't take it. Occasionally, it may mean mean the horse shouldn't be jumping anymore.If a horse decides to have trouble with a particular jump, have someone lower it for you to help the horse build confidence again."
"
Look into why your horse is bony in the first place.,
Develop a good seat.,
Consider purchasing a bareback pad.,
If you've never ridden bareback before, consider trying it for the first time on a less bony horse - for maximum comfort the first time, go for a fat, or at least broad backed horse, preferably shorter and easy to control.,
Try riding your own horse.,
Recuperate.,
Move on to trotting, jumping, galloping, and anything else you'd like to try doing without a saddle.",How to Ride a Bony Horse Bareback," Some horses, when in pretty good shape, just have naturally bony backs, but if your horse is slightly underweight (which can also cause a protruding backbone), gradually change his feed to help him put on a little more weight.;
, The bony back is really only painful when you're bouncing up and down on it, so the better you are at keeping your backside on the horse, the more enjoyable this will be.

, A bareback pad is a fluffy piece of saddle-shaped cloth that cinches onto your horse, and you can sit on it to cushion yourself. They also offer better grip, and are great for first time bareback riders, and those with bony horses. See the tips and warnings for advice on buying and using a bareback pad.

, It will be easier to adjust to riding your bony horse bareback if you're not also adjusting to riding bareback, too.

, You will definitely notice the difference, but especially if your seat is pretty good, you may be thankful for the backbone as a guide to keep you in the middle of the horse. Simply walk the first time, and you may also try cantering (or loping, if you ride western). The canter is actually more comfortable than the trot when you're riding bareback - you're rocking back and forth instead of bouncing up and down.

, Regardless of how much you've prepared for this, you're likely to be a bit sore and stiff for a day or two. Don't try to ride until you feel a bit better, because trying to avoid the pain when you ride will throw off your balance.

, Once you get used to it, you won't be uncomfortable at all, and just about anything is possible.

Use heavier weight poles (not PVC pipes or bamboo) so if your horse hits one of the poles he will realize that hitting them is uncomfortable.;
, Warm your horse up around them. Don't ask him to go over them yet.

, Dismount and walk the horse around them. Allow him to smell them and check them out.

, It's good if his hoof knocks into them once or twice so he gets used to the sound.


Head for the first pole and walk over it as if it's no big deal.
Praise him once he walks over it. This reassures him that going over the pole was the right answer.
Do this until your horse walks over the poles comfortably. He is familiar enough with the poles once he can walk over them without pausing to look at them and ask himself what they are doing in his way.

, You may need to adjust the distance between them to allow freedom of movement. (See related topics.)


Ask the horse to do this about five times.

, Make sure you always do this so he doesn't pull anything.

, Do this until the horse is comfortable and familiarized with it. Don't forget to praise him for doing what you ask

, This will come easier to some horses than others; make sure you don't overwork the horse till he hates you -- instead, teach the horse one or two things a session and end the session on a good note.


Once you can walk, trot, and canter him over the poles easily and without hesitation, move on to the next step.

,, Do this a few times so your horse is used to it.

, Once you and your horse get comfortable, raise it a little higher each time.


When cantering your horse over the cavaletti, find the correct distance from the jump to remind your horse when to jump.
Soften your hands (as in hold the reins less tightly) when you are about 2 strides before the poles, so that it is easier for the horse to jump (they actually need to stretch their necks to jump properly).
If your horse is going too slow towards the jump, ask him/her for more momentum.
If they are going too fast, shorten their stride to get the right distance.
If the horse has never jumped before (or you are trying a higher jump), it may refuse to jump (rear up, dodge the poles,...), and so you have to be quite experienced so that you don't fall or get hurt.

, Contrary to what many believe, horses generally jump better if you don't apply pressure and instead stay of out their way. Horses know how to jump, and they don't want to get hurt. When riders apply pressure to ""make"" the horse jump, the pressure limits the horses' freedom of movement.

Shorten your stirrups and reins.,
Assume the 3-point position.,
Grasp a handful of mane.,
Straighten your back.,
Keep your feet in line with your back.,
Direct your horse forward with your legs.,
Steer with your legs.,
Move back to three-point when necessary.",How to Ride in 2 Point Position," If your stirrups are too long, maintaining the 2-point position will be exhausting. Since 2-point is used primarily for jumping and the hand gallop, you'll want a slightly shorter stirrup. Shorten the reins as well to retain contact with the horse's mouth.;
, This is your ""normal"" riding position, with both legs and seat fully on the horse. Sink as much weight into your heels as possible. Do not continue until you feel stable and comfortable.

, Take a handful of mane in one hand, about a handspan in front of the pommel (5–6 inches / 13–15cm).


This step helps you balance. It is not preferred to hold onto any parts of the tack because if the tack falls off you will probably fall off too.

, Push your rear and hips upward, slightly above the saddle. This motion will also help you straighten your back, aligning your heels, hips, and shoulders. Your center of balance should be slightly forward of where it was in 3-point. Steady yourself on the horse's neck until you find your balance point.


Resist the impulse to squeeze your knees as you lift yourself up.

, Your ankles should be under your hips. If your feet are too far back, you may fall forward. If your feet are too far forward, you may fall back.

Do not straighten your legs. Your knees should be bent forward, so they can flex along with the horse's motion.

, When you feel comfortably balanced, squeeze your horse forward with your legs. Congratulations! You are now riding in a correct, clean 2-point position.

, If you want to go left, press against the horse with your right leg and ""open the door"" with your left hand, loosening the reins on that side and pulling outward. To direct the horse right, use the mirror image of these motions.


Do not steer with the reins except for the motion described. Pulling against the reins too hard may cause you to lose your balance. Use your leg to guide the horse.

, You'll probably start feeling uncomfortable or sore quickly the first few times you try this. If you ever feel like you're about to lose your balance, or if you're having trouble directing the horse, return to three-point position. Once you've readjusted your seating or handled a difficult situation, you can return to the two-point position."

Tie the horse up and groom it.,
Go over your horse with a rubber (not metal -- see Warnings) curry comb.,
Use the stiff brush.,
Use the soft brush next.,
Pick the horse's hooves.,
Use a mane and tail comb to gently ease out any tangles and burs in the horse's mane and tail.,
As you were grooming you would probably have noticed any swelling or cuts.,
Next, take a quick look at the horse's tack.,
Tack up your horse.,
Take the reins and put them back over the horse's head.",How to Prepare to Ride a Horse1,"

If it is Spring, and the horse is shedding, first use the shedding blade and sweep it along the horse's body in the direction of the horse's hair. You will have to stop and clean the hair off of it every few seconds. Do not use this brush on the head and legs and go lightly over the bony areas. Only use this brush in the Spring.



 

;
, Move it in small circles, removing any loose hair and dirt next to the skin. It also massages the horse's muscles. Push harder over the major muscles such as the hind quarters. Go softer over the bony areas such as the spine. NEVER use a curry comb on a horses legs, unless they have mud or dirt crusted on. On the horse's head don't use this brush at all.

, Move it in the direction of the hair in long strokes ending with a flick of the brush. This removes dust and hair that the rubber curry comb brought to the surface. Again,go gently on the bony areas. You may use this brush gently if needed on the legs. Do not use this brush on the head, as it will be too harsh.

, Go with the hair in long strokes. Use the soft brush all over the horse's body and face. This grabs all the dirt and hair that the stiff brush could not.

, To do this, you pick up the horse's hoof and pick the dirt, manure and stones from the sides of the frog. Do not do this if you are inexperienced at it! If you are experienced you probably know what to do. If you are not, get help from an experienced horse person several times until you know what to do.

, Start at the bottom of the hair and slowly work up to the top. You may have to use mane and tail detangler. When doing the horse's tail do not stand directly behind the horse, as the horse cannot see you. Take the tail and pull it to the side. Stand on either side of the horse's rump as you work.

, But, just to make sure, stand back and look at the horse from all angles. If there is any swelling in the legs or where the saddle and bridle would be, do not ride. If there is a major cut on your horse or a cut on the horse's legs or where the saddle and bridle would be, do not ride either. If there is only a minor cut or swelling somewhere else on the horse, you can still ride, and treat the cut or swelling later.

, If it is frayed or severely damaged, do not use it and ride after the horse has new tack.

,

Put the saddle pad on. Make sure the pad is in the right direction. Put it on the horse's back, covering the horse's withers completely. Then slide it back so that the front of the pad is half on the withers, half on the back. You do this to make sure the hair on the horse's back is flat so the saddle and pad are not rubbing against the horse's skin, causing a sore.






Gently set the saddle on the horse's back. You then, if you are using an English saddle, fasten the Velcro strap on the pad onto the keepers on the saddle on both sides. Then put the keepers through the strap on the bottom on both sides. If you are using a western saddle , just put the saddle on.






Put the girth on. You do this by fastening it to the keepers on one side.Then you go on the other side, grab the girth and fasten it to the keepers on the other side. It should be tight enough so that you can snugly fit two fingers in between the girth and the horse. Then make sure the saddle has not shifted. If you are using western tack you may just need to cinch it up.







Put on the bridle. Do this by first, putting the reins over the horse's head, so that after you take the halter off, the horse can't run off. Then remove the halter. Stand on the left side of the horse. Hold the top piece of the bridle in your right hand. Put your right hand, holding the bridle in between the horse's ears, so that the bridle dangles over the horse's face. Then with your left hand, Insert your thumb into the corner of the horse's mouth, so that the horse opens it's mouth. Use the same hand to move the bit into the horse's mouth, while pulling up with your right hand. Then put the top of the bridle up over the horse's ears, where it rests behind the horse's ears. Then situate the bridle so that it's comfy for the horse. If the bridle is not already fitted to your horse, have an experienced horse person adjust it. Don't for get to buckle up the nose band and throat latch.The first times you do this, I would strongly recommend you ask for help. Depending how tall the horse is and how short you are, you may want to have a stool or mounting block for this.







, Lead the horse around for a few minuets so that the horse will release the air that it has held in, expending it's tummy. Then tighten girth so that you can just barely fit one or two fingers between the girth and the horse. You should check the girth throughout your ride and adjust it accordingly. Now mount up and ride!

Use light reins.,
Sit on a “seat saver.” Soften the blows that your butt has to endure from sitting on a hard saddle.,
Adjust your stirrups’ length.,
Use a saddle whose stirrups swing freely.,
Wear the right boots.,
Choose flexible clothing.",How to Avoid Soreness During Your Horse Riding Training1," Expect your hands to grow numb or sore from having to hold the reins over the course of long rides. If possible, avoid using a thick rein made of rope. Instead, use a thinner rein made of leather, which is usually lighter and less taxing in the long run.Also, wear gloves to prevent blisters.;
, Cover the saddle with a seat saver whose cushioning absorbs most of the shock before it reaches your rear. Store your seat saver somewhere warm and dry after your ride.Keep in mind that some seat savers’ material (especially foam) may act like a sponge if it gets wet. This means it will become just as hard as your saddle if temperatures dip below freezing.

, If your knees feel strained as you ride, play with the length to find one that helps alleviate the pain. Length is a matter of personal preference, so don’t feel obligated to copy a more experienced rider if their preferred length causes you pain. As you shorten and lengthen your stirrups, remember:You want to find a leg position that allows your legs to comfortably exert enough force into the stirrups to raise your butt a little. This prevents you from sitting with all of your body weight on the saddle, which will make your butt sore.

, Whenever you go downhill, let your feet follow gravity. Straighten your legs in a forward direction as you descend. Do this to lessen the amount of pressure that your knees have to bear.Only use loose stirrups to straighten your legs forward. Sticking them out to your sides as if you were doing a split causes your muscles to tense up all over., Make sure they are tall enough to cover your ankles, which will keep them supported as you ride. Opt for a heel between 1 and 1 ½ inches to prevent your feet from spilling out of the stirrups. At the same time, avoid boots with heavy treads, which may cause your feet to become stuck in the stirrups, preventing a quick dismount in an emergency. Do not wear the following:Waffle treads
Thick treads
Hiking boots
Winter boots
Sneakers
Sandals and flip-flops

, For upstairs, stick to sweatshirts and T-shirts so your arms and upper torso aren’t restricted. In colder weather, opt for layers topped with a vest to keep your arms mobile. Downstairs, favor tights, jeans, and sweatpants. Be sure that they are flexible enough to allow your legs to move freely.Although you want your clothes to allow you freedom of movement, they should still be form-fitting or close to it. Loose clothing may become caught on your equipment or surroundings, which can lead to injury.
Don’t wear pants that easily become twisted or bunched up as you move in them.

If the horse, is hot and sweaty, loosen the girth but not so much it could slide to the horses belly, then walk it around until it is cool and dry.,
Then, untack the horse, beginning with the bridle.Put the reins, over the horse's head.,
Curry comb the horse where the saddle and girth was.

,
If your horse has a sweat stain where the saddle was, rinse your horse off with a hose.,
If your horse worked hard, don't let it drink much.,
Put your horse back into it's stall or pasture.

",How to Prepare to Ride a Horse2," An easy way to check if they are cooled of is to place your hand on their chest. If it is hot, keep walking your horse. If you don't your horse could get sick.

, Undo the nose band and throat latch buckles,lift the top of the bridle up and hold it there for a while until you can lower it without banging the horse teeth. If the horse doesn't release the bit, stick your thumb in the corner of it's mouth. Then, put the halter on, take the reins over it's head,and tie it back up. Now, you take it's saddle off. First take off the girth and drape it over the back of the saddle. Then undo the keepers from the straps and lift the saddle off the horse's back. If you are riding English, run up your stirrups first.

,, Walk your horse around until it dries. Only rinse your horse if it is warm outside. If it is cold, don't exercise your horse so much it sweats hard. When you are done riding it,don't walk it as long and put it in it's stall with a cooler on it for an hour or two instead.

, Offer it a sip of water after you are done walking it, and a sip of water after you untack it. Then with hold water for 15-20 min. depending on how hard it was worked.

Ride as though you’re standing up, not sitting.,
Hug the horse with your legs.,
Avoid arching your back.,
Point your toes slightly outward.",How to Avoid Soreness During Your Horse Riding Training2," Imagine that the horse suddenly winks out of existence from underneath you. Ride so that you would immediately land on your feet in a standing position if this were to happen. Ask a spotter to watch you ride and correct your posture as you go. Aim to maintain an unbroken line from your ear, through your shoulder and hip, and all the way down to your heel when viewed from the side.Although this form is considered ideal, the exception would be if you need to adjust your stirrups to alleviate strain in your knees.

, Although the horse’s body will force your upper legs to stick out to your sides, resist the urge to follow through with your lower legs. Don’t stick your whole leg out to the side. Keep your lower legs close enough to the horse’s body to maintain contact.Ask a spotter to watch you as you ride straight toward them. Have them alert you whenever you start to straighten your legs to the side.
Exerting pressure downward into the stirrups and out to your sides can lead to ankle and knee pain.

, Sit up straight to keep a straight line running from ear to shoulder to hip. However, be careful not to overdo it by arching backward. Stay seated on the seat-bones on your butt.Arching your back causes your weight to shift forward, which means you’ll be landing on your tender bits instead of the bones in your butt as you bounce in the saddle.
Being able to sit up straight without having to think about it is an important reason to strengthen your core both on and off the horse. This will prevent you from tensing up as you try to maintain posture.
In the meantime, focus on drawing your bellybutton in toward your spine. Concentrate only on the muscles required for this. This will help keep your back relaxed as you ride.

, Disregard outdated instructions about pointing your toes straight ahead of you. Avoid the unnecessary stress that this places on your joints. Instead, angle your feet so that each is pointing away from the horse by just a smidge. As you do, keep the balls of your feet in the stirrup. Stop when the weight of each foot feels evenly distributed across the entire stirrup.


This may be referred to as “pronating” by instructors.

Tuck, twist, turn.,
Balance your core.,
Clap your hands.Get into position by standing back against a wall.",How to Avoid Soreness During Your Horse Riding Training3," To start, stand up with your feet placed under your hips. Curl your fingers into loose fists with your thumbs sticking out. Keep your upper arms and elbows tucked to your sides. Raise your forearms to either side of you, with your palms facing up and your thumbs pointing behind you. Then:Bend your knees a little bit while tucking your tailbone inward.
Keeping your feet in place, turn your upper torso to one side, twisting from your waist.
Stop once your rear arm is pointed directly behind your butt.
Twist back to your original position, again using the muscles in your waist.
Perform the same movements on your other side for one rep.

, To begin, stand with your feet placed a hand’s length apart.Keeping your upper arms and elbow tucked to your sides, raise your forearms straight out to either side with your palms facing in front of you. Spread your fingers wide to keep the muscles in your hands, arms, and back active (think “jazz hands”). Next:Raise one foot slightly off the ground.
Keep your other leg’s knee slightly bent to better absorb your body weight.
Rotate your raised foot until your toes point inward.
Focus on your heel as it directs each movement, not your toes.
Lower your foot and repeat the exercise with your other foot.
Concentrate on your heels throughout to keep your core muscles engaged.

, Set your feet a hand’s length apart.Bend your knees as you do so your entire back makes contact with the wall. Tuck your upper arms and elbows into your side. Raise your forearms straight out to either side. Now:Sweep your forearms in toward each to clap your hands in front of you.
As you do, keep your forearms perpendicular to your body.
Once your hands have clapped, fold your fingers with your thumbs on top to mimic holding a rein.
Bring your forearms back to starting position and repeat.

Decide which ponies and horses that you would like to check out.,
Assess the environment in which the horse is being kept.,
When the animal is brought out to you, look at a how it is brought out.,
Ask the owner to put it through its paces.,
As the owner is riding, ask if it is okay to take pictures.,
Take a ride on the horse.,
After your ride, look at the horse's hooves.,
If all seems well, ask the owner to put the horse on ""hold"" for you.,
Consider the information you've gathered and the vet's report.,
Arrange for transport.,
Pay the owner as soon as possible.,
Introduce the horse gradually to other horses.",How to Choose School Horses," Prepare a list of places where horses or ponies are up for sale that appear to meet your budget and other needs and make appointments to turn up to each place (be sure to leave yourself enough time between visits). Bring a notepad and pencil along, as well as a camera, so that you can document the visits for reflection later.;
, When you have arrived at the place for each horse, check out the surroundings. Does it look neat, clean, and safe? Are all of the other horses (and other animals) in good condition?

, Does the owner have to pull hard, slap, or drag it over? Check to see if the owner is too hard on the animal and if the horse looks afraid of the person. Frightened horses are not suitable for school situations.

, The animal should have good, rhythmic paces and should not falter; if it does falter, it could be lame. If the horse goes crazy when the owner even gets in the saddle, something is definitely up.

, If so, take various pictures at each gait. Make sure that the owner is a good rider and that if the horse is wild, it is not the fault of the owner. Look carefully to see that the horse is not drugged (it will be sleepy looking or unnaturally calm).

, The owner should let you do this. Are the gaits smooth, even, and strong? Is the horse calm and steady, yet still alert? Make sure you know what level the horse is at––is it suitable for beginners?


Ask the owner if the horse has been ridden by other persons than the owner. If the horse is used to different riders, this is a good indicator for a horse intended for school work.

, They should be clean and healthy looking. Check the coat and mane/tail. They should look healthy and well-brushed.

, Get a vet to give the horse an all-over checkup. The vet will tell you everything you need to know about the horse's health.

, After reflection, you'll know whether or not you're making a right choice. If the vet okays everything, and you like the horse's temperament and gaits, etc, go ahead and sign the papers. If the owner has papers proving the breed, etc, take these as well.

, Also prepare ahead, to make sure that your home is ready for the new arrival.

, The owner may not allow you to remove the horse until payment has cleared but be sure that you've both signed a sale contract before handing over money.

, For the first few days, keep it separate until it becomes familiar with you and its surroundings. Make sure your horse is healthy, happy, and safe!

Do stair exercises.,
Try the wall strengthening exercise.,
Try beach ball hip adductor exercises.",How to Get Into Shape for Horseback Riding1," Walk up to the stairs in your home-if you don't have any, a stair stepper will do or a stepladder if you have one. Stand on the stair closest to the ground. When you stand, hold onto the railing at first. Now, holding the railing, balance on only the balls of your feet. Slowly stretch down and lower your heels until you feel the stretch in your calves. Sound familiar? This is recreating the stirrup! Hold for ten seconds. This will not only improve your position, but your balance as well!
Now, try letting go of the railing- this will take some practice. Try until you can balance for two seconds, then try five, then increase little by little as you improve.;
, This is a variation of the stair exercise. Walk up to any wall in your house and put your foot up against it about 1/2 to 3/4 of the position it would be in your stirrups. Hold for three seconds then release back against the wall.


Repeat five times; as you get better you can increase amount of time with your foot up and how many you do in all.

, Use any rubber or plastic ball as long as it is at least a foot in diameter. Find a hard chair that allows your knees to sit at right angles to the floor and then scoot to the edge of the chair so that your thighs are completely off of it. Squeeze the beach ball between your knees, hold for fifteen seconds, and then release. Do this a few times a day until 15 becomes easy, then increase to 20, then 30, and so on.


This is a great way to increase your ability to hang on to your horse with your thighs. It increases the inner thigh muscles. You can also go to the gym and use what is called the ""hip adductor"" machine. Many equestrians who have had to take time off have noted that when they regularly use the hip adductor machine before getting back on a horse, they are more likely to feel fit and avoid the pain in the inner thighs when one gets back on a horse after a long time off.

Just like runners walk to cool down after a long run, a horse needs time to cool down before he stops working entirely. You can never walk for too long. Horses that have worked hard deserve to cool down as much as they need to! When you finish walking on your horse, he should not be breathing heavily or still actively sweating.;
, Take both feet out of the stirrups at the same time and get off your horse from his left side.Roll up your stirrups. Loosen your girth by one or two holes. Put the reins over his head so that you can lead him more easily.


Put your hand between your horse’s front legs. If he feels extremely hot or is still actively sweating, keep walking him by hand. Make sure that the horse is not breathing heavily. If he is, keep walking him by hand.

, Fill a bucket with lukewarm or cold water and offer it to him. If he drinks a whole bucket of water, give him another. It is a myth that “hot” horses, or horses who have just worked, cannot drink water after a ride.A horse can lose between two and four gallons of sweat per hour if it’s hot and he is working hard, so he will need to drink to prevent dehydration., Put your halter in your left hand. Put the reins over your horse's head, as though you are going to ride again. Undo the nose band and the throat latch. Slip your horse's bridle over his head, putting it in your right hand. Put on his halter, which should still be in your left hand. Put the bridle aside so that you can clean it later., Attach the horse to cross-ties if you’re in a barn or a hitching post if you’re outside. If you’re using cross-ties, attach the small metal buckles of the cross-ties to either side of the horse’s halter, through the metal loops closest to his mouth.


If you’re attaching him to a hitching post, attach the buckle on the lead rope to the loop on the halter that is underneath the horse’s cheeks. Attach the lead rope securely to the hitching post.

, Take off the horse’s saddle, girth, and saddle pad. If there is no saddle rack in the barn, you can put the pommel (or front) of the saddle on the ground, leaning it against a wall. You can also leave it upside down.Flip the saddle pad upside down so that the sweat can begin to dry.


Make sure that you can access your lead rope easily. Keep your grooming area clean and organized.

, Your horse should have his own set of brushes, which should include a curry comb, stiff brush, soft brush, hoof pick, towel, and sweat scraper.

, Curry comb your horse for, ideally, ten or fifteen minutes. The curry comb brings up dust, dirt, and sweat that is matted inside the horse’s hair., Brush from nose to tail, or with the direction of the hair. Don’t be afraid to be vigorous. Focus especially on areas that are sweaty or have touched the tack. If your horse doesn’t mind, use the stiff brush on his face, especially around his ears, which will be sweaty from the bridle., Use a damp towel on his face if it is sweaty.

, Make sure that there are no rocks in his feet and that you do not scrape the frog of the horse’s foot, which is the softer triangle in the middle of his foot. This area is sensitive., If your horse is hot, sweaty, or still has sweat marks on his body, you can hose off the areas of his body that are still sweaty. It is important to get all the sweat off of his body before he goes back in his stall; imagine sleeping in your own bed after you’ve run four miles and haven’t showered!After you hose down the sweaty areas of your horse, use a sweat scraper on those areas to rid your horse of excess water so that will dry faster. Instead of sweat scraping his legs, dry them off with a towel.
If your horse is only mildly sweaty in a couple of places, dip a stiff brush in a bucket of water to “wet brush” him. With the wet brush, brush the sweaty parts of the horse. This is like a miniature bath. When you’re done grooming your horse, there should be no sweat marks on his body. He should look either well-brushed or well-bathed!

, Put on anything that he needs to wear in his stall, such as bell boots or a cribbing collar. Apply any medications, like thrush medication for your horse's hooves, if it is necessary.

, Attach the lead rope to his halter and lead him into his stall or paddock. When you lead a horse, you should put your right hand near the end of the lead rope, near the horse's chin, and have your left hand holding the excess lead rope. Do not wrap the lead rope around your hands, though. The horse should walk to your right., When you enter the stall, turn around so that you are both facing the stall door. Remove his halter, exit the stall, and close it behind you. Put the halter away; there is usually a hook right next to the stall door. Give him a peppermint or a slice of apple to reward him!

, Pull excess hair away from your brushes and throw it away. Place all of your brushes back in your grooming box, and put your grooming box back in the tack room. If your horse pooped in the barn, scoop up the poop and put it in the poop bucket.

, Wipe down your saddle, girth, and bridle with saddle soap, removing any sweat or dirt. To do this, take a sponge, dip it in a little bit of water, and then apply soap to the sponge. Sponge all parts of the saddle, bridle, and girth thoroughly. Work the soap into the leather so that there are no suds on the saddle.The leather should look clean and feel soft. Rinse and clean your horse’s bit with water. Put the tack back where it belongs in the tack room.

, There are several reasons why disabled people choose to ride, ranging from therapeutic, sport, recreation, communing with nature, exploring a relationship with one of man's best allies, educational etc. Hippo therapy can improve the quality of life of a truly engaged disabled person, so it is definitely worth raising as a good outdoor activity for a disabled person champing at the bit to get out there and experience the free movement of nature via a caring animal.

, There are very reputable organizations in many countries that cater for disabled riding. Get their information pamphlets, look them up online and phone them for an appointment. Share the information with the person you are seeking to encourage and ask them to come to the appointment with you. If possible, arrange a meeting with some of the horses to help a familiarization process take place.

, Horse riding can result in innumerable benefits. For one, the relationship between rider and horse is unquantifiable and is a great source of affection, support and connection that is hard to describe adequately in words. Disabled persons who horse ride have been known to increase their levels of confidence, their interactiveness with people and have overcome fear and pain barriers that previously held them back. Physical benefits include improvements in balance, flexibility, muscle strength, toning, spatial awareness and coordination. Emotional benefits besides the bonding include increased concentration skills, planning skills, improved self-esteem, increased confidence and patience.

, Many great plans die for lack of transport and someone must be responsible for this aspect.

, Take the disabled person to a horse riding gear specialist to obtain the appropriate gear. Ask about making modifications as needed and get these done well in advance of lessons.

, You should have already decided in advance if group or individual lessons will work best in the particular situation. Take into account level of knowledge, fears, need for company, availability of teachers etc.

Try the plank position.",How to Get Into Shape for Horseback Riding2," If you prefer other abdominal exercises like crunches, that’s okay too. Good riding is abdominal riding. This means that you need to really use your abdominal muscles to balance yourself, while clinching the horse with the legs when needed. Doing sit-ups with a work-out ball is up to 20% more effective. , Even if you don't practice yoga regularly, holding a few key positions, like the boat, half-boat, or warrior, for a few seconds a day can improve your fitness. As an added bonus, doing these moves correctly can also strengthen your back and improve your posture! These also help open up the shoulders, which is good for people who do a lot of slouching.

, It is easy to become complacent about posture when sitting at a computer or watching TV, but these are some of the best times to work out your back and shoulder muscles by simply sitting up straight and opening your chest. Riding is an aerobic activity, so the longer you are able to maintain your poster, the better equipped you will be for riding. , This is a good exercise for the back and core, and it doesn't require as much coordination as yoga. Lie with your back on the floor and your knees flexed. Now lift your knees towards your head instead of the other way around. Repeat as many times as you would do a normal sit up. This move is better for your abs and doesn't shorten your hip flexors. It's important that those are loose for riding. , This is often considered yoga move and it is great for your core muscles. Put yourself into the push-up position but instead of leaning on your hands, lean on your forearms. Push yourself up so that only the balls of your feet and your forearms are touching the floor. Contract your deep core muscles and keep your back flat, making sure to not let your lower back arch or your hips droop toward the floor.


Hold for about 45 secs and repeat a few times a day. (If you can't do an elbow plank without your lower back hurting, start with an easier version, which is just holding the upper position of a push-up.)
Try the plank on horseback in the jockey position, and grab the neck for comfort to the horse and the rider. This will gain the forearm to help you stay balanced on the horse for 20 secs.
This is also good for people who are into show jumping and approaching a jump.

Don’t neglect any muscle group.,
Do your own horse chores.,
Make sure you do aerobic exercise at least three times a week.,
Build muscle endurance.,
Stretch!,
Try doing pull ups, push ups, or other back-related workouts.",How to Get Into Shape for Horseback Riding3," In riding it is necessary to have even toning all over your body. Do not neglect doing some upper body exercises. Many upper level riders have a small set of weights and lift them a few times a day.

, Give your horse a good massage with a rubber curry comb. Carry your own water buckets and hay. Do chores around the barn like clean the horse's stall or paddock and wheel the wheelbarrow. All of these horse related activities are exercise and make the barn your free workout gym.

, You don’t need to be aerobic shape to run a marathon, but you do need to be relatively slender and fit. Try to go on a 20-30 minute run three times a week to keep your endurance and stamina up and any extra weight off. , Endurance is a huge part of being a rider. Running should help with your aerobic endurance, but you need to build muscular endurance also. Try starting a weight lifting regimen with lower weights and high reps. Fitness is great but if you don't have endurance you can't go anywhere.

, Always stretch before and after exercise. Take time to warm up and to cool down. Focus on stretches that target your groin and thighs, such as the butterfly stretch, to stay flexible and reduce stiffness. Be sure you do all of your stretches slowly and carefully.


Studies have shown passive static stretching prior to a workout can reduce stability and strength. If you must stretch, warm up using dynamic stretches particularly for the inner thighs.

, Swimming is also a good option. Many beginner and intermediate riders focus too much on abdominal strength and end up leaning forward in the saddle. Counter this tendency by exercising back muscles and think ""lean back"" instead of ""sit up"" when on the horse.

Go to many different riding schools before choosing the best one for you.",How to Choose a Good Riding School1," Here are the things you need to look for when choosing a riding school:

Look at the facilities that suit you the best.
Look at the horses.
You want a friendly, helpful place.
Look at the cleanliness.
Are there people your age?
You also want a place that has fair but firm rules.

"
"
Ask around.,
Look through the yellow pages.,
Search the Internet.,
Also, don't be afraid to watch a horseback riding lesson to see what you will be doing if you choose that school.

",How to Choose a Good Riding School2," Never underestimate word-of-mouth recommendations. Do you have a friend, or know somebody or rides locally? Ask them where they go. Other places to get recommendations are:


Horse-savvy relatives or friends
Your local equine veterinarian
Employees at the tack/riding supply shop or at your local feed store
Local tack shops.
;
, However, not all stables or riding schools are listed under the yellow pages, and it is hard to tell the quality of such a school or stable through an ad.

, More and more riding schools and stables are getting websites or advertising online. Websites can give you more information then a single advertisement. There are some local authorities and organizations that inspect and approve riding school. Some have lists of approved centers on their website.

,"
"
Call the prospective lesson site.,
Be prompt.",How to Choose a Good Riding School3," Ask for a tour of the facility. They will be happy to show you around as they understand that without surveying the facilities you will not be able to make a decision. Set a date and time.

, You want to make a good impression. Some things to watch for:


Is the barn clean and tidy? The muck heap and dirty bedding should be kept in a pile away from the barn. There should be no broken glass or other dangerous items around.
Is everything in good repair? For example, does the barn seem run down or in danger of falling apart? Are any of the fences broken?
Are the stalls relatively clean? Horses should not be standing in puddles of their own urine, and stalls should be mucked out once daily.
Is the riding arena cramped or obviously too small for the size of the lesson?
For any individual activities you may pursue, are there facilities to encourage this? For example, is there a jumping arena, or a place to go trail riding?
Do the horses seem happy and healthy?
Is the owner and staff open and friendly?

"
"
Speak to any instructor(s) that you will be learning from.",How to Choose a Good Riding School4," An instructor can make or break a riding experience. Before you sign up for lessons, make sure that the instructor(s) is certified and can make your horseback riding experience a safe and enjoyable one. Here are some questions to ask:


Where did your instructor get their credentials?
How long have they been riding and teaching.
What style of riding do they teach? Is this the style you want to learn?
The most important question is one you should ask yourself: Can I see myself learning from this person?


"
"
Watch different types of lesson, and lessons by different instructors.

,
Watch one or two lessons to make sure that this is really a place that you want to learn at.,
Pay careful attention to the horses.,
Do all of the people in the lesson seem to be about the same level?,
Also observe the students.",How to Choose a Good Riding School5,", Watching more than one is a good idea, as you can develop more of a feel for this person's teaching style.

,


Are they well-behaved?
Are they full of energy, or do they seem tired and lethargic?
Are they well-groomed, or very scruffy? A little mud or dirt is okay, but when the horse is caked with it, you have a problem.
Does the experience level of the rider match that of the horse they are on?
As a general rule of thumb, no horse should be used more than four hours a day with breaks, and no more than 15 hours a weeks. This would depend on the horses fitness and the type of lessons/hacks given. Work load should be suit the individual horse.


, You do not want to be a beginner in a jumping class, or working with people who have only begun to trot when you are already cantering. Is the barn staff appropriately dressed for teaching? They should be wearing jodhpurs or long pants, along with boots or close-toed shoes. When they are riding, they should always wear a helmet. Western instructors tend to be a bit more lax when it comes to this, however.

, Are they dressed in appropriate riding clothes? These would be long pants, riding boots, and a well-fitting helmet. Everybody should be practicing proper conduct around horses, i.e., no running, shouting, or otherwise endangering themselves or their horses.

Choosing a barn is a very personal thing.",How to Choose a Good Riding School6," You will be investing a lot of time and money into your horse-back riding education, and it is not worth trying to get an education at a school or stable you do not feel comfortable around. Here are some questions you should ask yourself:


Does this school teach the style of riding I would prefer to learn?
Do I feel comfortable around the instructor/stable hands?
Do I feel comfortable on/around the horses?
Does this school have ample facilities to accommodate my interests?
Do I like the other students and do I feel comfortable spending large quantities of time at this stable

Avoid things that cause ulcers.,
Look for signs of stomach ulcers in foals.,
Look for symptoms of stomach ulcers in adult horses.",How to Treat Stomach Ulcers in Horses1," Diet, exercise, and lifestyle all play factors in whether or not a horse will develop an ulcer. A horse’s stomach is split into two parts--the the non-glandular part which immediately follows the esophagus, and the glandular part, which secretes enzymes like pepsin and hydrochloric acid. The glandular part is coated with mucus and bicarbonates, which protect it from the effects of hydrochloric acid or in common terms Muriatic acid! (Imagine drinking Muriatic acid). The ulceration of the non-glandular part of the stomach is the most common type of ulcer because it does not have the same protective lining as the glandular part. Causes of ulcers include:Prolonged feeding of concentrates.
Prolonged starvation and low frequency of feeding (feeding only 3x/day).
Stress like prolonged and high intensity exercise, prolonged or frequent transport, prolonged confinement, depression, and no socialization with other horses.
Prolonged use of NSAIDS (Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs). These drugs block the production of chemicals in the stomach that inhibit acid production.
Starvation in foals caused by poor mothering mares that lead delayed or infrequent milk suckling.;
, Foals may exhibit different symptoms than those of adult horses. Stomach ulcers are very prevalent in foals who have not suckled milk properly and they can actually lead to death. If you notice any of these symptoms, bring your foal to a horse veterinarian immediately. In particular, look for:Colic or extreme abdominal pain
Teeth grinding or bruxism
Excess salivation
Diarrhea
Poor appetite
Emaciation or poor body condition
Attempting to lie on his back

, Some of the symptoms that foals exhibit may also become apparent in adult horses. Whenever you observe these clinical signs you should suspect stomach ulcer, and immediately consult or bring your horse to a horse veterinarian. They can diagnose it definitively using an endoscope (a device that can see the inside of the horse stomach) and give proper treatment and advice. Look for:Poor appetite
Poor body condition
Weight loss
Mild colic
Mental dullness
Attitude changes
Poor performance
Lying down on back more than usual

Discuss vaccinations with a veterinarian.,
Decide what vaccinations are needed.,
Figure out when to give vaccinations.,
Gather supplies and the vaccine.,
Get training from an experienced person.,
Recruit someone to help you.,
Fill the syringe.,
Prepare the injection site.,
Inject the vaccine.,
Dispose of the needle and dirty supplies.,
Care for the horse.,
Look for bad reactions.",How to Vaccinate Horses," A veterinarian should have a good understanding of what diseases are common in horses in your area, whether the horse's health history and vaccination history should impact its vaccinations, and how much and when vaccines should be given in order to prevent common diseases.This discussion can occur over the phone or over email if your horse does not need a veterinary exam.
You can also just make an appointment for the veterinarian to give your horse its vaccinations. However, this will cost you more money than doing it yourself.;
, There are core vaccines, which all horses should get, and at-risk vaccines, which are usually used only if your horse is in a region where the disease is active. Even if a veterinarian suggests a variety of vaccinations, it is up to you to make the final decision. Balance your veterinarian's expertise with your desires and your financial ability to pay for vaccinations.


Core vaccines include equine encephalitides, rabies, tetanus, and West Nile virus.Optional vaccines include equine influenza virus (EIV), strangles, Potomac horse fever and botulism and equine herpesvirus 1&4 (EHV1&2)., The vaccinations a horse needs should be given at very specific times in order for them to be effective and in order to avoid negative side effects. Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for when to give specific vaccinations or follow a vaccination schedule supplied by an organization that you trust.Different vaccinations will need to be given at different times and some vaccinations need repeated doses. This means that you will likely need to give your foal many shots in the first couple months of its life.
For example, the rabies vaccine should be given annually, tetanus should be done annually but also right after an injury occurs, and the West Nile virus vaccine should be given in the spring.

, If you are doing the vaccinations yourself, you will need to get the vaccine from a veterinarian or a veterinary supplier. You will also need supplies like a syringe and cleaning supplies to keep the needle and the injection point clean.A new needle should be used for every injection. Keep this in mind when ordering supplies.

, You should not inject a vaccination into a foal with no training or experience. Find someone who knows how to do it and get them to help you through the process.If you have never given your horse a shot before, consider hiring a veterinarian the first time and watching how they do it.
Remember that the health of your horse is important and doing intramuscular injections incorrectly can be dangerous for it.

, Even if you know how to do the injection, you will need another set of hands to help. While you are injecting the vaccination into the horse, you will need someone to help keep it steady.


Ideally, you will have someone that the horse is comfortable with to help you with the process. This way, the horse is more likely to remain calm.

, Before you give the shot, you will need to put the vaccine into the syringe. Take the cap off the needle and place it into the hole on the vaccine bottle. Turn the bottle upside down and draw the vaccine into the syringe by pulling on the plunger of the syringe. Next push on the plunger a bit to get all of the air out of the syringe.Lastly, pull the needle out of the bottle. Tap on the syringe while you hold it needle-side up. This will loosen any air bubbles stuck inside. Then gently compress the plunger on the syringe to get rid of those air bubbles.
When filling the syringe, draw in a few more cc's than you are planning on injecting. This will allow you to push a few out when getting air out of the syringe.
It is very important that you make sure that there are no air bubbles in the syringe before you inject it into the horse.

, You can inject the vaccine into the horse's neck or into the muscles around the tail. The neck is most commonly used and is best if only giving a few shots.Once you have decided where to give the shot, you will need to clean the injection area.


Cleaning the injection site can be done simply by removing all dirt and debris and then rubbing the area with a cotton ball covered in rubbing alcohol.

, You will need to do an intramuscular injection. This type of injection goes into the muscle mass of the horse. It is done by quickly plunging the needle into the muscle and then compressing the plunger of the syringe slowly.Tap on the injection site with your finger before you insert the needle. This will get the animal used to the feeling of the shot and will lessen its reaction.
A quick insertion of the needle is less painful for the animal than a slow one.

, Once you have injected the vaccine, you will need to pull out the needle and dispose of it properly. A used needle should be put in a sharp instruments container. This is used so that the needle doesn't accidentally prick anyone. Any supplies that have blood or body fluids on them should also be disposed of properly, ideally in a biohazard container.


Biohazard containers and sharp instrument containers are available online or through you local medical supply company.
To find out where you can dispose of your sharp instruments container when it is full, contact your local waste disposal agency., After a vaccination you should care for the injection site and you should also take it easy on the horse. A horse that has received an intramuscular injection is likely to be sore, so exercise it gently.The injection site should be kept clean. There is no need to bandage it but don't allow it to get filthy dirty.

, After you give your horse a vaccination, you should keep an eye on the horse for a day or two afterwards to look for a bad reaction. Look for swelling or irritation around the injection site, as well as the general signs of illness. If a horse is lethargic or has a lack of appetite right after getting vaccinated, you should contact your veterinarian.Keep an extra close eye on a horse that is getting a vaccine for the first time. This is when adverse reactions are likely to occur.

Look for signs of a ringworm infection.,
Keep a close eye on horses at high risk of infection.,
Get the ringworm diagnosed by a veterinarian.,
Isolate the infected horse.,
Assess whether treatment is necessary.,
Apply a topical treatment for ringworm.,
Clean all equipment and areas that the infected horse has been in contact with.,
Give your horse oral medication for ringworm if topical treatment is not effective.Oral medication, such as antifungal Griseofulvin, can be is added to the horse's feed.",How to Treat Ringworm in Horses," A horse may be infected for up to three weeks before signs develop and therefore look entirely normal. Typically, the first hint of infection is patches or tufts of hair that don't lie flat and stand a little proud of the coat. This is because the ringworm fungus invades the hair shaft and weakens the hairs which makes them stand at a strange angle. These hairs are easy to pluck out because of the damage to the hair shaft.Areas where the skin is rubbed regularly, such as on the neck along the line of the reins, or behind the thighs where the rug string rubs, are more vulnerable to infection. The skin in these areas is slightly worn away and weakened by the friction. Also areas such as the nose and muzzle are at increased risk, as the horse explores water and feed bowls used by other (possibly infected) horses.Ringworm lives off superficial, dead skin cells and hair, so lesions appear on the skin's surface. As the infection progresses the damaged hairs are shed, leading to small bald patches. Often there are multiple patches that have the appearance of round, bald, scaly areas. These are often grouped together on the neck, withers, or behind the thighs, although any area can be affected.
As the infection becomes mature, the bald areas may coalesce together to form larger bald areas. These patches are often scaly and may have a grey, 'cigarette ash"" tinge to them. Crusts may form over the bald area, but these are not a sign of healing, indeed the crusts can protect the fungi and make it more difficult to treat.;
, Young horses and horses who have come into contact with an infected horse are at high risk of infection. Young horses are at great risk because their immune systems have not met the fungus before and so don't know how to fight it off. Older horses, especially those who have had infection in the past, may develop a degree of immunity that lessens the effects of ringworm in the future.Unfortunately, a common way to catch ringworm is from other infected horses. This can happen simply by rubbing against a fence or stable touched by another infected horse. Indeed, tack such as reins, girths, or saddles, or equipment such as riding boots can become infected and act as a source of transmission from one animal to another.
Another problem is that it can take up to three weeks before an infected horse shows signs of the infection. During this time the horse may be in contact with other horses or be transported in a trailer and rub against the walls, which acts as a source of infection for others.However, remember that the fungus that causes ringworm occurs naturally in the environment and in the soil. Contact of the skin with the fungus can lead to colonization of the skin and an infection developing.

, You want to get a professional diagnosis in order to verify that your horse is indeed infected. Your vet will diagnose ringworm either by examining samples of plucked hairs under the microscope to look for the fungus or fungal spores, or by placing pieces of hair onto a special nutrient plate that changes color in the presence of ringworm., You need to limit the spread of the infection, which is done by keeping the infected horse away from uninfected horses. Where possible, it is best to isolate the horse for 2-3 weeks during and after treatment to reduce the risk of spreading the infection.

, In some cases, the horse's immune system will fight off the infection. In these cases the infection is considered 'self-limiting,' meaning that no treatment is necessary to cure that horse. However, because of the risk of infection and widespread shedding of fungus into the environment, it is advisable to treat ringworm before it has run its course.


It can take around 6 - 15 weeks for self-cure to take place. During this time the horse is a source of infection to other horses.
If the lesions are itchy and the horse rubs a lot, the ringworm patches may get infected are require further veterinary attention. Signs of infection include reddening of the area, inflammation, scabs formation, or weeping or discharge from the area., The first line of treatment is to use a topical treatment that is wiped over the affected areas to damage and kill the fungus. The product licensed for use in horses contains a drug called enilconazole (Imaverol). This is a liquid which damages the structure of the fungus and kills spores. It should be applied to the skin and hairs every three days for at least four treatments.Imaverol is concentrated and needs dilution prior to use. 1 ml of Imaverol is added to 50ml of water to make a 0.2% solution. It is best to spray the whole horse for the first treatment, in order to contact any fungus which is present but not yet showing signs of infection. After than it is acceptable to treat the infected areas only with a margin of skin around them to catch any sideways spread.The diluted imaverol needs to contact the fungus, therefore scabs need to be removed first. This can be done by soaking them in a shampoo Malaseb (containing an antifungal agent, miconazole) and then picking them off or brushing gently with a toothbrush. Take care to wear gloves so that your skin doesn't become affected.
After removing the scabs, thoroughly dry the skin so that water doesn't further dilute the Imaverol and weaken its action.

, Use any leftover Imaverol solution to wipe down reins and tack to decrease the risk of spread via equipment. It is also advisable to scrub down woodwork and surfaces with a 10% solution of bleach to kill the ringworm spores, which could pose a source of future infection.

, This treatment is usually reserved for hard-to-treat cases that are resistant to topical therapy.


The horse receives treatment daily for 7 days. However, this treatment works from the inside out, and takes longer to be effective as the fungus need to contact the chemical in the blood. Also, some of the shed fungus could potentially still be infective.

Rest the horse for a week.,
Place the horse in a stall and make sure that his hay bin is always full.,
Feed your horse before letting him exercise.",How to Treat Stomach Ulcers in Horses2," This will ensure that no reflux of acid will reach the non-glandular part of the stomach. During exercise and training, a lot of acids are refluxed, because exercise puts pressure on the stomach. Rapid movement that occurs during training can also cause acids in the stomach to splash. The stomach contains rapidly dividing cells. Resting the horse will ensure that the damaged lining will be repaired.

, Horse stomachs secrete acid in a cyclical fashion. This means that the acidity will increase and decrease throughout the day--sometimes a horse’s stomach will have a pH of 5 or it can drop to as low as a pH of 1. When a horse has hay 24/7, his stomach will always be full. Hay causes the horse to chew more, thus creating more saliva; saliva protects against strong acids.


The chewed hay will float in the horse’s stomach and will form a protective layer that prevents the reflux of acids into the non-glandular part of the stomach.
Roughage like alfalfa hay, for example, contain a lot of substances that act as antacids like calcium, magnesium sulfate, saponins, and mucilage proteins.

, After you have let your horse rest for a week, you can begin to reintroduce him to exercise. Thirty minutes before the exercise, feed him small amounts of alfalfa hay or 500 grams of alfalfa chaff. The alfalfa will create an alkaline layer that blocks acid splashing into the upper non-glandular section of the stomach.

"
"
Give your horse proton-pump inhibitors.,
Give your horse histamine Type 2 (H2) receptor Blockers.,
Try giving your horse protective coatings.,
Try other substances that promote protective lining growth.,
Give your horse antacids.,
Give your horse probiotics.",How to Treat Stomach Ulcers in Horses3," These drugs cause complete blocking of acid production, which in turn lets the stomach heal itself. These drugs are more potent than others and are generally given to the horse once a day.


Omeprazole and pantoprazole are both proton-pump inhibitors. Omeprazole (dose at 0.7mg to 1.4mg/kg daily), is the only FDA approved drug for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses. Commercially available paste of omeprazole can be given once a day, and during transport.

, These drugs cause partial blockage of acid production in the stomach, hence it is given more frequently. In general, you should give your horse this medication three or four times a day.


Cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine are variations of this medication. Dose of cimetidine (300 to 600mg 3 to 4 times a day). Ranitidine is effective in foals and is given once a day.

, These drugs provide a protective lining in the stomach mucosa and aid in its healing process. There are two main kinds of prescribed protective lining, sucralfate and lecithin.


Sucralfate: this drug binds to the stomach mucosa and may promote healing. Dose for foals (1 to 2 grams in foals 4x a day), in horses (2mg/kg 2x a day).
Lecithin: contains phospholipids and essential fatty acids like linolenic acid (omega 6), and linoleic acid (omega 3). Lecithin binds to the lipid layer of the stomach, providing an additional layer of protections against acids, omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids strengthens the cell membranes of the stomach lining.

, Other substances that give a protective layer in the stomach include slippery elm powder, low protein whey powder, and psyllium husk. These substances can be given as slurry before feeding, or as top dressing in dry feed.

, Sodium bicarbonate can be used up to 200grams per dosing to provide short term relief, and neutralize gastric acid, it is usually given after feeding whole grain rations.

, Probiotics include yoghurt products containing Lactobacilli spp. As a daily, these probiotic supplements can help as the beneficial bacteria competes with ulcer forming bacteria.


Prostaglandins can also combat bad bacteria. These are recommended in horses that have developed ulcers because they have high doses of NSAIDs.

Look for dental landmarks in horses between the ages of 5 and 20 years old.,
Identify the dental landmarks of a senior horse (20 years plus).",How to Tell a Horse's Age by Its Teeth," The color of a horse's teeth provide a general clue as to horse's age. The milk teeth are white, and the permanent teeth (which erupt at 2 ½ to 5 years of age) that replace them are cream-yellow. With increasing age they turn brown (20 years plus).;
, Looking at the shape of the chewing surface on a horse's incisors will also help you to determine its age. Milk incisors are oval, adult incisors are circular, and senior incisors are triangular.


The cutting or chewing surface of the tooth is the portion of the tooth perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. It is also sometimes called the “table” of the tooth.
The incisors are the teeth located at the front of the mouth, which the horse uses to chop grass. When you peel back the horse’s lips, it is the incisors you see. The teeth at the back of the mouth, which you cannot see without special equipment, are the molars.

, These are the names given to various ridges that form a pattern on the biting surface of the horse's incisors. They are formed by deep ridges in the enamel, which wear away over the course of the animal's life to give characteristic shapes.


To check for an infundibulum or “cup,” open the horse’s mouth to see the chewing or cutting surface of the incisors. A cup is a deep brown linear mark toward the back of the incisor surface and is present from when the adult tooth first erupts, but it becomes fainter over time. The cup disappears first from the central incisors (those in the center) around 9 years of age, then the middle incisors around 10 years of age, and the corner (outer) incisors at around 12 years of age.
Once all the cups have worn away, the horse is said to be ""smooth mouthed"".
""Stars"" are a circular brown mark that sits in front of the cup. This first appears at 8-10 years of age and becomes more obvious with age.

, Young teeth meet in a vertical line. After 5 years of age, the teeth start to slope and meet at an angle. In an aged horse (20 years plus), this sloping angle can be very acute.

, Galvayne's Groove forms as a result of a slight fold or indentation in the tooth enamel. It is a quirk of nature that it develops at a fairly predictable age and is a useful guide to aging horses between the ages of 10 to 25-30 years old.It is a brown mark that appears at the gum line at the center of the upper corner incisor at approximately 10 years old. It grows down and reaches halfway down the tooth at 15 years before leaving the gum line at 20 years. The mark then grows out completely over the subsequent 5-10 years afterward.


For example, a horse where the groove is only present in the lower half of the corner incisor is going to be between 23-25 years old.
Horses under the age of 10 and over the age of 30 do not have a Galvayne's Groove, so to avoid jumping to the wrong conclusion, take other factors into account when aging the horse., The teeth most easily visible, and those which are most commonly used to age a horse, are the incisors. They are found at the front of the mouth and can be seen by peeling the upper lip up, and the lower lip down.


The incisors are used to shear grass, which is then passed to the back of the mouth by the tongue, to be chewed by the molars. There is a gap between the incisors and the molars, called the diastema. In this gap, some horses grow extra teeth called ""wolf"" teeth (actually the first premolar), but these teeth are usually extracted between 2-5 years of age because they interfere with the bit, and they are therefore not relevant to aging., The horse has 6 incisors in the lower jaw and 6 in the upper jaw. The two middle incisors are called the ""central"" incisors, and moving outwards there is the ""intermediate"" and then ""corner"" incisors (which are the incisors in front of the diastema).The horse also has six upper and six lower cheek teeth on each side. These are grinding teeth and are used for chewing. They are difficult to see at the back of the mouth and play no major role in aging a horse.

, Aging a horse is not straightforward and every clue helps. As well as looking at the teeth, look at the horse itself to gain a general picture as to whether it is a youngster who still has some growing to do, an adult in its prime, or a rickety old nag in its golden years.


Look at the horse as you approach, stand back even and appraise him. Does he look sprightly and young, doddery and old, or is he a leggy colt with growing still to do?

, Take your time and don't feel pressured. It helps to have a notebook to record what you see. There are a lot of factors to consider and it's easy to forget one or two.


To avoid this, perhaps jot a list down of the things you need to inspect in the horse's mouth, and then note beside each what you saw.
This allows you to sit down later and draw all the jigsaw pieces together.

, When preparing to examine the horse's teeth, have the horse restrained in a halter, so you have good access to the mouth.


Have the horse stand in good light, and if it is raining, perform the examination under cover so that you can concentrate without water running down your back.
It helps to have an assistant to hold the horse, or even write down notes, so that you are free to concentrate on the teeth.

, When performing the exam, it is the incisors at the front of the mouth that you will look at. To get a good view, simply lift the top lip and gently push it upwards out of the way. Do the reverse with the bottom lip, pushing it down so that you can clearly see the lower incisors.

, Be meticulous in your exam so that you don't miss anything. Ask yourself:


At what angle do the upper and lower incisors meet? Stand to the side of the head and decide at what angle the upper and lower incisors meet.
Do they meet in a straight line, or at an angle? If the latter, make an estimate as to the angle and write this down.
What color of the incisors? Are they white and milky looking (deciduous teeth), or more yellow and brown (adult teeth)?
What shape are the incisors? Are they spade shaped with a narrow neck and wide crown (milk teeth), or are they uniformly ""tombstone"" shaped (adult teeth)?
What shape is the biting edge of the incisors? Is it long and narrow (young teeth), oval (adult), or triangular(old)?
Are all the teeth present or have some fallen out?

, After you have attended to the general observations listed above, you should start looking for specific marks and grooves.


Is a hook present on the upper corner incisor? The so called “seven-year hook"" is a very useful clue as to the horse's age.
Is there a vertical brown mark on the upper corner incisor? If so, does it touch the gum and how far down the tooth does it reach? This is Galvayne's groove and a useful tool to help age the horse.
Examine the biting edge of the incisors. Is there a distinct brown line (cup) present, a faint brown line (mark), or a brown spot (star)?

, It's important to understand that aging a horse by his teeth gets less accurate the older he gets, especially when he is over 10-14 years of age.


Factors such as diet can ""age"" the teeth, whilst vices (such as crib biting), general dental care, and genetics also play a part.
For example a stabled horse eating soft alfalfa hay has less wear on his teeth than a horse out on rough pasture, and in comparison the latter's teeth will make him look older than his true age.

, Within days to weeks after its birth, the foal's first milk teeth start to erupt through the gums. The central incisors are generally the first to put in an appearance.


The milk teeth are smaller and whiter than permanent incisors. They are shovel shaped with a distinct neck (adult teeth are more ""tombstone"" shaped).

9 month old: By 9 months of age the foal has a complete set of milk teeth, but not all the teeth have grown down sufficiently to be in wear.

, You can accurately age a horse from newborn to 5 years of age. Landmarks in this period include the eruption of all the milk (deciduous) teeth, and their replacement by permanent, adult teeth, which is complete by 5 years of age.



12 months old: All milk teeth present but the corner incisors are not long enough to be in wear (they do not touch the matching teeth from the opposite arcade). The milk teeth are white and spade shaped with a distinct neck.

2 years old: The corner incisors meet the opposite arcade and are now in wear (used for cutting grass and chewing).

3 years old: The center milk incisors are replaced by adult incisors. The adult teeth are bigger, blockier and lack a distinct neck. They are more yellow/cream in color than the milk teeth.

4 years old: Adult center and intermediate incisors, but the corner incisors are still milk teeth.

5 years old: All the incisors are now adult teeth.

, Aging an adult horse is done by taking multiple factors into consideration, such as marks on the chewing surface of the incisors, the angle of the teeth, various grooves in the enamel, and the presence of spurs.



5 year old: Adult teeth newly in wear. Incisors meet at a near vertical angle. Teeth are upright and blocky. The chewing surface of the incisors is concave. The shape of the tooth is cross section is oval.

5-9 years old: Cups are present on the chewing surface of the incisors. These grow out by 9-10 years of age, leaving lighter ""marks"", which are gone by 12 years of age.

7 years old: The upper corner incisor has a spur or hook where it overhangs the lower incisor. This is known as the ""7 year hook"" because it disappears by 8 years of age. However, this is an inconsistent finding and may be present on one side of the mouth but not the other.

10 years old: Galvayne's groove appears as a brown-colored mark at the gum line of the upper corner incisors. By the age of 11 years the chewing surface of the incisors is flat. The shape of the tooth in cross section is round. Stars appear (from 8-10 years) on the chewing surface of the incisors and become more distinct with age.

15 years old: Incisors meet at a near 90 degree angle. Teeth are elongated with a chisel like edge. Galvayne's groove is now halfway down the upper corner incisor.

20 years old: Galvayne's groove has disappeared from the gum line of the upper corner incisor.

, This is where the expression ""long in the tooth"" comes from, because an aged horse has long incisors that meet at an acute angle.


The teeth are yellow or brown in color. The incisors are very long and sloping. The upper and lower incisor arcades meet at an acute angle. The cutting surface of the incisors are triangular.
Galvayne's groove is absent from the gum line and grows out completely by 25- 30 years of age.
25 years plus, some teeth may start to loosen and fall out.

Digital thermometer: A digital thermometer is best, as it will beep when the temperature becomes stable. It will also keep the temperature displayed in the display window for you to easily record the temperature if needed. Purchase a digital thermometer at your local drug store. This can be a regular “oral” or “rectal” thermometer, which are basically the same thing.Dedicate this thermometer for use with your horse. If you are unable to get a digital thermometer, a mercury thermometer works just as well. Double check to make sure that it is clean and does not have any cracks, as this can be very dangerous for the horse.
Gentle lubricant. You also need a gentle lubricant to ease the passing of the thermometer into the horse's rectum. Vaseline or KY Jelly is ideal. These products are readily available at grocery stores and drug stores.
A pair of latex or rubber gloves.
Cotton wool or tissue and rubbing alcohol.;
, It’s best to time taking a horse’s temperature for just after he has passed stool. This will reduce the possibility that you will insert the thermometer into dung. Dung registers a higher temperature reading and your reading will not accurately reflect the horse’s body temperature.


Try feeding the horse or giving it a treat. This way, the horse will begin to trust you.

, Usually, the owner of the horse will be the one taking the temperature. However, in instances where you may be taking care of a friend's horse or you're relatively new to first aid for horses, you need to become familiar with the horse. You also need to let the horse become familiar with you.


Talk soothingly to your horse.
Feed it a little treat, such as a carrot or apple.
Scratch your horse’s nose or behind its ears.

, Ensure that the horse doesn't move around too much while you are taking his temperature. Tie him up to a wooden fence or post.


Use a quick release knot so you can release him quickly if he gets spooked or agitated.

, A helper can hold the horse and talk soothingly to him as you take the temperature. This not only reduces the risk of getting kicked and/or trampled. It also means that you can concentrate on the job at hand while another person watches the horse's reactions and informs you of what the horse is doing.

, If you are using a digital thermometer, switch it on. Make sure that the digital display appears in the display window. This will ensure that the thermometer is working correctly and that the battery is not dead. Wait until the digital display is flashing L (for low temperature reading). This will flash for approximately 10 seconds before registering a reading of a low or normal temperature.


If you’re using a traditional mercury thermometer, shake it vigorously two or three times to make sure that the mercury has returned to the bulb prior to use. If you don’t take this step with a mercury thermometer, the mercury will read a previous ""high"" and you will get a false reading.

, This is best done by dipping the bulb end (the end that inserts into the anus) with a blob of Vaseline or KY Jelly. Once this is done, you are ready to take the horse's temperature. , Prevent your horse from getting spooked by standing on the mounting side. Most horses are trained to be handled on the near side (for mounting, catching, etc).

, Move toward the rear of the horse from the front at an angle. This allows the horse to see you, as horses have a blind spot directly behind him and directly in front of him. You will be much less likely to startle him if you come from an angle.


Run one hand along the horse’s back, maintaining his attention and reassuring him that you are still there.
Stand close to the horse's rump to avoid being kicked.
Never under any circumstances stand directly behind the horse. If he kicks out, you could be seriously injured or even killed.

, As you stand with the horse’s rump to your left, you are facing towards the horse’s tail. Stroke the horse with your left hand (holding the thermometer in your right) and travel your hand down the horse's rump to the base of the tail. Gently grasp the tail base with your left hand and raise it sufficiently high to gain access to the anus., Peer around to get a good view, but without stepping behind the horse. Gently introduce the thermometer bulb into the anus.


If the horse is ""clenching,"" it helps to gently rotate the thermometer. This may help the thermometer to gently slide past the clenched muscles of the anus.
Alternatively, wait a few seconds. Most horses don't clench their anal muscles for long, so once he relaxes, slide the thermometer right on in.
You only need the bulb of the thermometer to be inside the anus. Do NOT slide the thermometer in beyond half the length of the thermometer neck. There is NO need to slide the whole of the thermometer into the rectum. This is how thermometers are lost internally!
While some techniques advocate tying string to the thermometer in case of internal slippage, this is NOT advisable. If the thermometer goes entirely internal and swings around 90 degrees, pulling on the string could damage the rectum. It is equivalent to trying to get a ladder through a door when it is full width across the door frame. It's just not going to work. Instead, you are better advised to be cautious with how far you advance the thermometer.

, As you insert the thermometer, keep talking with your horse to reassure him. Many horses may not enjoy the sensation and they will benefit from a soothing voice.

, Put slight pressure on the thermometer and push against the horse's near side (toward you). Don't do this too forcefully, just until there is a slight resistance. This will make sure that the tip of the thermometer rests against the rectal wall, not inside it.


This is important so that the thermometer is not inserted into dung, as dung registers a higher temperature reading.

, A mercury thermometer will gradually increase, so you should wait until it has stopped increasing in temperature and is sitting at a constant temperature. A digital thermometer will beep when a reading has been established.


This can take anywhere between 30 seconds and 2 minutes, depending on the time it takes for the temperature to become constant.

, Take the thermometer out by gently pulling it out of the horse's bottom at the same angle it went in. Make sure that you don't flick or pull too fast during the removal of the thermometer, as this will pull the dry skin around the thermometer.


If you were to slip or let the thermometer slip, you could possibly lose or drop the thermometer, or hurt the horse.
Be aware that some horses will pass gas during this process, so you might want to hold your breath.

, If you suspect that the horse has an elevated temperature, repeat the procedure another one or two times. This will ensure that you get a mean temperature rather than just one measurement. Sometimes, variables such as dung and a stalling thermometer may affect your results.

, Make sure the thermometer is turned off, or shaken down. Give the thermometer a good rub over with a disposable tissue or cotton wool. Soak a clean piece of cotton wool or tissue with rubbing alcohol and wipe it over the thermometer. This will disinfect the thermometer.


Make sure to remove any manure which may have become attached to the thermometer.

, Track how your horse’s temperature reacts depending on time of day, weather, and other circumstances. For example, in the early morning, the temperature should be slightly lower, whereas at night or late afternoon, the temperature will likely read higher.


If you take your horse’s temperature when he is not ill, then you’ll have a baseline temperature with which to compare abnormal temperatures.

, Make sure that you do this before you forget the temperature. If you jot down the temperature in a diary, you can track the temperature over some length of time.

, The average body temperature of a horse is 99 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 degrees to 38.5 degrees Celsius).

, Your horse’s temperature may vary slightly depending on which breed of horse you own. There are three types of horses: cold-blood, warm-blood and hot-blood.These designations don’t mean that your horse will have a drastically different body temperature from another horse, but there may be slight variations.


Cold-blood: Native ponies, such as Welsh, Fjord, or Fell ponies, are better suited to cooler climates and naturally have slightly cooler body temperatures.
Warm-blood: These horses are usually athletic with strength and stamina. Their body temperatures tend to run slightly higher. Examples include: Irish Draughts, Lipizzaners and Quarter Horses.
Hot-blood: These horses are usually the most athletic horses. They are often used in long-distance riding and racing. Some examples include Arabs, Shagyas and Thoroughbreds.
Keep in mind, however, that generally speaking, the normal range is from 99 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit, with anything above 101.5 to be seen as a possible infection.

, If the weather is extremely hot or extremely cold, your horse’s temperature may be slightly off one way or the other.


In cold winter weather, a horse’s normal temperature shouldn’t be above about 100.5 degrees F.
During the summer, a horse’s core temperature can raise up to 101 degrees F or more.
Call your vet if the temperature is over 101.5 degrees F., If your horse has been in an intense competition, such as a race or show, its temperature might be higher than normal. Some race horses can even have their core temperatures rise to 105 degrees F.


You should call your vet if the temperature does not go down to the normal range within about 90 minutes., If you have taken your horse’s temperature a few times over the course of several hours or a few days, and it remains high, call the vet.


Call your vet if the horse’s temperature remains above 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.

, If your horse's temperature is above the normal range, and he has other symptoms, contact your veterinarian.


Observe your horse and keep track of the other symptoms, such as loss of appetite or lack of energy.

, It is possible that the thermometer may slip entirely into the horse’s rectum. If this happens, call your veterinarian immediately.


If the worst did happen and the thermometer slips internally, there is a chance it may be passed when the horse has a bowel movement. Call your veterinarian immediately, but monitor fecal output and check for the presence of the thermometer in the droppings. You can always cancel a vet visit if the thermometer comes out on its own.

Don't maintain a tight grip with your legs around the horse's ribs, as this will lift you out of the saddle and forfeit some of your deep-seat control.Keep your legs directly under your hips. Your body should be aligned from your ear all the way to your heel.
Angle your feet so that your heel is lower than your toe. Turn your toes slightly out so that your lower leg has more contact with the horse's body.
Let your legs gently touch the horse's body from the thigh down to the ankle.;
, Turning your head will help you have a better command of where you want to go. Keep your chin up and look straight at a fixed point (a tree, a fence post, etc.) in the direction you want to turn. Let your shoulders turn just slightly. If you turn your shoulders too much you risk losing your balance., Once you've fixed your eyes on a spot you want to turn towards, begin rotating your hips towards that spot. This will send a message to your horse, indicating that a change of course is approaching.Try to maintain a stable position with the rest of your body. Just give a slight twist of the hips.
Don't rotate too abruptly, or again, you run the risk of losing your balance.

, Once your shoulders and hips are facing the desired direction, you'll use your legs to steer the horse's body. You'll need to coordinate both legs and control how much pressure you use from each leg, as this will affect the turn greatly.Squeeze gently just behind the horse's girth with the leg outside of the turn you're trying to complete. For example, if you're turning left, your right leg would be your outside leg.
Use your inside leg to apply a gentle pressure directly on the horse's girth.
If you're turning left, your left leg should press against the horse's left girth and your right leg should squeeze just behind the horse's right girth.
If you've done everything correctly, your horse should have turned in your desired direction. if the horse didn't turn, keep practicing or consider trying a more cooperative horse.

, As you ride around a fenced-in area on your horse and post with its movements, you should begin to get a sense of your horse's rhythm and the timing of its feet.Once you learn your horse's movements, you can gently move your hips with the horse's rhythm to maintain better control through the seat.Post the trot by rising out of the saddle slightly for one beat and lowering back into your seat for the second beat. Don't bounce up and down, just move gently with your horse's movements.

, As your horse moves, your pelvis rocks forward and backward in synch with the horse's movements. Your pelvis will naturally match your horse's gait, but you can alter your horse's speed by keeping your pelvis in position and adjusting your pelvic movements.Angle your pelvis slightly forward. Try to maintain your center of balance, and don't lean too far forward or you may get disoriented.

, With your pelvis and hips in place, you should be able to spur your horse to go faster using only your body's posting movements. This may take some practice, so be patient and stick with it.Increase contact between your legs and the horse's sides. A very gentle squeeze will let the horse know you wish to go forward, and your hips/pelvis will adjust the horse's speed.
Some horse riders deliver a gentle kick in the sides if a horse doesn't get the hint that you want it to speed up.Move your hips and pelvis forward and backward at a faster speed than the horse is rocking you.

, Once you've mastered how to speed your horse up, you'll want to learn how to slow it down. You increased the movement of your hips and pelvis to speed up, but to go slower you'll need to cease all movement of your hips and pelvis.Tighten up the muscles in your stomach and buttocks. This should stop the movement of your pelvis in the saddle.
Maintain contact between your legs and the horse's sides, but make sure you do not squeeze or create tension with your legs. Try to keep them relaxed and hanging naturally over the horse's sides.
Close your fingers around the reins to further indicate to the horse that you wish to slow down.

, You can try using vocal commands with your horse, but they work best when a horse has come to associate those words/sounds with a complementary action. However, some words (like ""woah,"" ""easy,"" and ""back"") are easily understood by horses due to frequent exposure.If you want your horse to respond to a verbal command like ""faster,"" you'll need to train your horse by saying ""faster"" while you squeeze or gently kick the horse's sides.
Be aware of your tone of voice. The tone you speak in is at least as important as the actual words you say to your horse.

, If you're determined to learn how to steer with your legs, you'll want to use an English saddle over a western saddle. English saddles are smaller, thinner, and lighter than western saddles. Other than the difference in saddles and steering, though, the two styles of riding are generally very similar.Western saddles are designed to be comfortable for prolonged sitting and riding, which is important for ranch work.
English saddles are designed to maximize contact between you and the horse's back and sides., Some horses are more willing than others to yield to a rider's commands. If you switch horses every time you practice steering with your legs, you may not get an accurate gauge of your progress. Try to get a sense of how cooperative your horse is, and if it seems like your horse won't be willing to take cues from your legs and hips then you may want to consider trying a different horse., All of your balance and much of your control stems from how you sit in the saddle. Many novice riders sit on the crotch instead of on the seat bones, but this hinders your ability to use the seat as an aid in steering your horse.Try to keep your hips forward and pull your shoulders slightly back, but not too far past your hips or you'll lose your balance.
Keep your elbows slightly bent and don't let your hands fall back past the saddle.
Make sure you're not tilted too far forward or your legs will not be able to properly grip the horse.

Since a stable has dust and other allergens in the air, increasing your horse’s pasture time would give him more fresh air and less exposure to allergens. More time at pasture would also give your horse a chance to eat fresh grass, which does not have heaves-inducing allergens.Heaves that is made worse by stabling is called barn-associated RAO. If your horse has this form of heaves, leave him out on pasture as much as possible.Another form of heaves, called pasture-associated RAO, can actually get worse with pasture time. If your horse has this type of heaves, limit his pasture time to only the winter months.If you are not able to increase your horse’s pasture time, house him in a part of the stable that doesn’t have a lot of airborne allergens.This could be a stall located closest to the stable entrance or near a window.
At the time of diagnosis, your vet will be able to tell you the form of heaves affecting your horse.;
, Whenever you bring your horse back in from pasture, the stable should be well ventilated. Keep the stable's windows and doors open as often as possible.Fresh air coming in from the outside will decrease the amount of allergens in the stable.If you keep the windows or doors open during the colder months, place a blanket on your horse to keep him warm. Make sure the blanket fits him—the straps of an ill-fitting blanket can leave rub marks and sores on a horse’s body.Use large overhead fans to promote airflow and circulation throughout the barn. You can also use box fans to increase the airflow within your horse’s stall. Either way, make sure clean air is flowing into the horse’s stall.

, Since hay contains allergens, storing it overhead could increase the level of those allergens in the air. Rather than storing the hay overhead, keep it in an area completely removed from your horse, such as a storage trailer or other weatherproof building.If you must store hay in the barn, cover the hay with a large tarp to decrease the amount of circulating allergens.

, Low-dust bedding is crucial to treating heaves in horses. Examples of low-dust bedding are chopped paper and chopped cardboard. Straw is extremely dusty and is not recommended for bedding.Particles in straw are fairly large and may not get far enough into the lungs to cause airway inflammation.Nonetheless, you would be better off not taking the risk of worsening your horse’s heaves with straw bedding.

, Cleaning your horse’s stall will also reduce your horse’s exposure to allergens, as long as it’s done correctly. After putting your horse out to pasture, use a metal pitchfork to remove the manure and dirty bedding. Then, use a shovel to pick up whatever fell through the slats of the pitchfork. If you see any damp spots on the floor (indicating urine), spray them with an absorbent deodorizer to remove the scent of ammonia.Ammonia, which comes from decomposing urine, can irritate your horse’s airways.It can take up to an hour for air particles to drift back down after cleaning, so do not return your horse to his stall until several hours after cleaning it.Do not sweep the stable frequently. Frequent sweeping will increase the level of airborne allergens.Before sweeping, consider wetting the floor to reduce the amount of dust flying into the air.If you decide to sweep or use a blower to clean the stalls or barn aisle, do so when all the horses are turned out and the barn is empty.

, Spraying down the arena will minimize, to a small degree, the amount of dust flying around while working your horse. Wetting down the arena should keep your horse more comfortable while exercising., Making changes to your horse’s diet will also treat his heaves. Since eating hay is a common cause of heaves in horses, you should take hay completely out of your horse’s diet. In particular, do not feed your horse round bale hay, which has a high dust content.Avoiding hay is especially important if your horse has severe heaves.
When a horse eats hay, especially round bale hay, he buries his nose in it. Moving his nose through the hay causes dust to fly up into the air, causing him to breathe it in, which severely exacerbates heaves., If removing hay from your horse’s diet is not possible, consider soaking it in water before feeding it to him. Soaking the hay overnight will reduce the hay’s nutrient content, so soak it for only about 15 minutes.Make sure your horse eats the immediately. If not, the wet hay will dry out and grow mold.Soaking hay can be helpful for mild cases of heaves.Unfortunately, soaking hay can worsen a severe case of heaves.Discuss the pros and cons of soaking hay with your vet. They can recommend whether it would be a good treatment strategy for your horse.
Consider getting a large commercial soaker that will steam your hay in big batches if you are feeding a lot of horses. Hay steamers wash the hay and kill mold and bacteria., While out on pasture, your horse will have access to grass, which is one of the best things your horse can eat. In the winter, when there is not much grass on the ground, feed your horse a complete pelleted feed, which is low in dust and provides the nutrients your horse needs to stay healthy.Consider feeding your horse the pelleted feed as a supplement to grass.Follow the label instructions to determine how much feed to give your horse.
Talk with your vet if you are not sure which pelleted feed to purchase for your horse.

, Other than grass and pelleted feed, several other low-dust foods are good for horses with heaves. Examples of these foods are silage, alfalfa pellets, and alfalfa cubes.Alfalfa is a type of hay, but is low in dust when in pelleted or cubed form.


Your horse may actually prefer hay cubes or silage over the complete feed., Feeding your horse off the ground keeps his airway open and keeps him from inhaling dust and allergens off the ground. It also allows for any bits of hay and dust to settle on the ground below where your horse won’t eat., If your horse has mild or moderate heaves, then changes to his diet and environment could be all that he needs for treatment.Many horses with heaves, though, require additional treatment with medications. Corticosteroids (steroids, for short) reduce inflammation, making them very effective for heaves treatment.Steroids can be given either intravenously or by mouth.Intravenous dexamethasone, one type of steroid, is effective in treating severe cases of heaves. Prednisolone, another steroid, has fewer side effects than dexamethasone. It is usually used to treat less severe cases of heaves.Prolonged steroid use can have serious side effects in horses. To prevent these side effects, your vet will gradually taper your horse’s steroid dosage., A bronchodilator relaxes the airways, allowing a horse to breathe more easily. This type of medication can provide immediate relief to airway obstruction. Bronchodilators come in several formulations: injectable, oral, and aerosolized. Aerosolized bronchodilators, which a horse can breathe in, are especially useful for horses with severe heaves.Bronchodilators can also clear mucus from the lungs. Their effects last about 1 to 3 hours.
Clenbuterol and albuterol are types of bronchodilators that are available a local drugstores with a veterinarian’s prescription.
Because bronchodilators do not treat inflammation, they cannot be the sole treatment for heaves. They must be given with steroids. , If your horse needs long term steroid use, your vet may recommend a low-dose, aerosolized steroid. An aerosolized steroid has fewer side effects than a systemic steroid. Be aware that aerosolized steroids are expensive, since you would have to purchase the mask to administer the medication. Despite the cost, this formulation would provide targeted relief of your horse’s airway inflammation.Aerosolized steroids are not given when beginning heaves treatment because the airways may be too obstructed for the medication to work effectively., Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antihistamines have not shown much benefit in horses with heaves.Do not use these medications to treat your horse if has heaves.

If you trotted sitting without difficulty, call for the canter gait.",How to Ride a Horse With No Stirrups," These should be done on the ground, regularly for several days before you begin to train without stirrups. Without having something to push down on while riding, you will be more responsible for your own balance while astride, and strong core muscles are a must.;
, Make sure the horse is responsive and both you and the horse are relaxed. Ride some schooling exercises, stretch your legs, and do some work with stirrups.

, If necessary ask someone to hold the horse.

, Do it in this order in case you need to get back on at any point (getting on with the left stirrup).

, Feet and knees pointing forward, heals down, back and shoulders relaxed, even weight in seat bones... It's even more important without stirrups to allow the weight to fall into your knees and have an independent lower leg. Sit like you would with stirrups, don't let your legs or feet lose their position or flop down. Point your heel far down, this makes it easier to grip with your legs.

, When you feel comfortable, start to post to the walk, rising out of your saddle as the horse's outside shoulder moves forward. This may be hard at first, so stick to just walking for now and move on to a trot next time. Don't use your hands for this: do NOT use the reins or pull on the horse's mouth for balance. Keep your posture, especially hands, in the correct riding position most appropriate for your discipline.

, When you are ready and relaxed ask for trot.

, Relax your back and shoulders.

, A common fault in novice riders is to raise straight up. Posting without stirrups will force you to post correctly by swinging your hips forward and moving your core. Keep proper riding posture. If you can't post, it is recommended to return to the walk to prevent any accidents.

, Let your hips swing side to side, and grip with your thighs. Do not grip with your knees, as this will cause uncomfortable pressure points for your horse, and do not grip with your calves as this is the aid that asks the horse to speed up.

, Grip with your thighs and let your leg straighten a bit to help you keep your balance. If you feel you are going to lose your balance, return to the walk. Remember, having a death grip on the reins is very bad for your horse and will not make you a better rider.

Make sure you’re dressed appropriately.,
Get acquainted with your horse.,
Groom your horse.,
Tack up your horse.,
Learn how to lead your horse.",How to Ride a Horse For the First Time (Kids)1," When you go to the barn for your first ride or lesson, you should be dressed appropriately for handling and riding horses. Here are some things that you should remember to acquire and wear before your first trip to the barn:


Long pants (jeans or breeches)
Closed-toe shoes, such as boots with a small heel or sneakers
A helmet (many barns provide helmets, but you should check to make sure)Gloves (optional, but sometimes helpful if you have sensitive skin);
, One way to make you and your horse more comfortable with one another before you ride is petting it. Always approach your horse from the side, preferably the left side. Scratch your horse’s neck gently. Different horses like affection in different ways, but almost all horses love a good neck scratch.You can also ask whoever is helping you tack up your horse for the first time (such as a barn manager, riding instructor, or the owner of the horse) if you can feed your horse a quick treat before you ride. Keep in mind, however, that it might be a good idea to wait until after you ride to reward your horse.

, At most barns, you will have to groom your horse before you ride it. You will have to use several different brushes to take good care of your horse before and after you ride.


First, you curry comb your horse. Using the curry comb, brush your horse’s entire body, travelling from front to back in small circles. The curry comb is used to bring up dust and dirt out from the horse’s coat.
Use a hard brush next. Use the hard brush in short, firm strokes that go with your horse’s hair. Go from the front of your horse to the back of your horse. Do not use the hard brush below the horse’s knees or on its face.
Finally, use a soft brush. You can use the soft brush everywhere on your horse, including below its knees and on its face.
You should also pick your horse’s hooves with a hoof pick. Stand at your horse’s side, next to one of its hooves. You should be facing the opposite way that your horse is. Run your hand down your horse’s leg. When you get to the area below the knee and the hoof, pull gently. Your horse should recognize this nonverbal command lift up its foot, exposing the underside of its hoof. With the metal hook of your hoof pick, pick out dirt and rocks from your horse’s hoof. However, the “frog,” or the soft middle part of the hoof, is often sensitive, so be careful not to pick at that., Depending on whether you ride hunt seat, western, or dressage, you will have different types of saddles and bridles. If this is your first time riding, someone will help you tack up your horse. Pay close attention to how this person puts on the saddle pad, saddle, girth, and bridle, so that you can do it by yourself next time.


Make sure that the girth it tight enough. You should be able to put one finger between the girth and your horse, but no more than that.

, When you lead your horse to the ring, you should be standing to the left side of it. The reins should be in your hands, not over the horse’s head. Your right hand should grip both reins near your horse’s mouth. Don’t hold them too tightly. Your left hand should hold the excess reins. Do not loops the reins around your hands.


When you walk forward, your horse should follow. If it resists, do not look back at the horse. Say something like “Come on,” and tug the reins lightly.

Notice any behavioral changes.,
Check for digestive problems.,
Watch for overall poor health.,
Look for wood-chewing.,
Know that gastric ulcers are common in athletic horses.,
Recognize that stress can cause ulcers.,
Know that diet can lead to ulcers.",How to Spot Ulcer Symptoms in Horses1," Symptoms of gastric ulcers can be nonspecific and hard to notice. Your horse may alter their behavior if they have a stomach ulcer. Their attitude may change and they may become less eager to do things they used to. The horse may act irritably or dazed.The horse may not perform as well or enthusiastically as before, and they may be reluctant to train like they used to. Your horse may seem nervous or not want to do certain moves as before.
Bruxism, or teeth grinding, is one of the most common behavioral changes with ulcers.;
, A symptom of gastric ulcers is poor or reduced appetite. Your horse may be reluctant to eat when presented with food or may graze less. After they begin eating, they may stop and walk away because the food hurts their stomach.Due to this, your horse may lose weight.

, Gastric ulcers can lead to a decline in your horse’s overall condition. Look for any decline or changes in your horse’s health or bodily condition. You may also look for any problems with the horse’s coat.Your horse may feel lethargic, so they may spend more time lying around than usual. They may also lie on their back to try to help relieve the pain from the ulcers.

, If your horse has a gastric ulcer, they may start chewing wood or cribbing. Chewing wood helps the horse produce more saliva, which can help neutralize stomach acid.If you notice this behavior, your horse could potentially have stomach ulcers.

, Stomach ulcers are common in all horses, but they occur more commonly in athletic and active horses. Thoroughbred race horses, endurance horses, and show horses seem to have the highest chances of ulcers. If you have an athletic or extremely physically active horse, your horse may be more prone to gastric ulcers.Exercise moves the acid in the stomach around, which can get it up in the upper and vulnerable part of the stomach. Exercise can also lead to more stomach acid production. These things can cause ulcers.

, Horses that are under certain types of stress can develop gastric ulcers. Stressors include being hauled around or being enclosed in unfamiliar stalls, both of which happen when going to and from horse shows or races. Changes in schedules can also lead to ulcers. It may take up to five days to develop the ulcers.Your performance horse may appear fine and unstressed, but the hauling or shipping can lead to ulcers.

, The way you feed your horse can lead to ulcers. Changing your horse’s diet suddenly may lead to an ulcer. Feeding your horse a diet high in carbohydrates can lead to gastric ulcers or acid reflux due to the fatty acids released by the carbohydrates.Horses that are not allowed to graze throughout the day for food and are instead fed twice a day can develop ulcers. This is due to the stomach’s natural acids and schedule getting off by a non-natural feeding plan.
Horses are grazing animals and having them graze steadily throughout the day will allow them to produce an even amount of stomach acid and natural digestion.

Mount your horse.,
Put your feet in the stirrups and your hands on the reins.,
Follow your instructor’s directions.",How to Ride a Horse For the First Time (Kids)2," Find a mounting block; it’s hard to get on a horse from the ground, especially your first time riding. Stand to the left of your horse. Put the reins over your horse’s head; hold them with your left hand and grab a chunk of mane, too. Stand facing your horse, and put your left foot in the stirrup. Stand up off of your left foot and swing your right leg around. Try not to land on the horse’s back too hard. Put your right foot in the stirrup, and take the reins in both hands.get on the normal way.

, Make sure that the balls of your feet are in the stirrups. You should put your heels down throughout your ride to provide stability and balance. You should also make sure that your reins are not twisted; they should be in a straight line from your horse’s bit into your hands.


Your instructor can also help you adjust your stirrups to make them longer or shorter.

, If you are riding a horse for the first time, you should definitely have an adult with you to supervise you. Whether you’re taking a riding lesson or going for a pony ride on a friend’s horse, you should always follow the directions of your instructor.


Make sure that you can hear your instructor, even from across the ring.
Be sure to tell your instructor if you feel nervous, uncomfortable, or scared. This is normal, and your instructor can help you get over your fears.
When you’re done riding, you will probably be asked to walk your horse for 10-15 minutes until it cools down. When its neck is about the same as the air temperature, you can dismount."
"
Dismount your horse.,
Groom your horse.,
Clean and put away your horse’s tack.,
Praise your horse.",How to Ride a Horse For the First Time (Kids)3," Take both of your feet out of the stirrups, hold the reins in one hand, and swing off onto the left side of your horse. Put the reins over your horse’s head so that you’re holding them again, and roll up your stirrups and loosen your girth., When you untack your horse, you should first take off all the horse’s tack and put it to the side. Then, repeat the same grooming steps that you completed while you were tacking up your horse. If your horse is sweaty, you might need to rinse it off with a hose in an outdoor “wash stall.” You could also sponge off its back with a large wet sponge.


However, since it is your first time riding, you should listen to what your instructor says. Different barns have different rules for taking care of their horses, so don’t be afraid to ask questions.

, Cleaning your horse’s tack is really important, especially if you’re sharing tack with other students or borrowing someone else’s tack. Put your saddle on a saddle rack, and hang your bridle up somewhere where you can easily clean it.


Find some saddle soap, a sponge, and a bucket of water.
Rub the sponge on the saddle soap. Dip it into a little bit of water (less is more). Squeeze the sponge to rid it of excess water.
Clean the leather parts of the saddle and bridle with the sponge. You should get all the dust and dirt off of your tack.
Clean your horse’s bit (the part that goes in his mouth) with water. Scrub it with a wet toothbrush to clean off all the grass and debris that was in your horse’s mouth.

, Give your horse a carrot, an apple, or a horse treat. Make sure to give it to the horse with your palm flat so that it doesn’t nibble your fingers by mistake. Pet him again, especially if you had a good ride!


Your instructor will help you lead your horse either back to its stall or to the pasture where it lives.

"
"
Look for any problems with the flank.,
Notice any digestive problems.,
Check for behavioral changes.",How to Spot Ulcer Symptoms in Horses2," If your horse has colonic ulcers, your horse may have sensitivity to its flank, which suggests a digestive problem like an ulcer.The horse may also resist having a saddle put on it due to pain in that area.

, Colonic ulcers can cause problems with the horse’s digestive system. The horse may not want to eat, which may lead to weight loss. Your horse may also have diarrhea or loose, watery stools. This is often caused by an ulcer in the colon.Colic or colic symptoms may also point to a colonic ulcer. Your horse may paw the ground or lay down a lot. They also may develop mild anemia and have a poor quality hair coat.
Colonic ulcers often present as nonspecific symptoms including recurrent colic episodes.

, Colonic and gastric ulcers both affect the horse’s overall behavior. Your horse may act lethargic or irritable, and they may refuse to do work or exercises that they used to do. Your horse may not have as much energy or stamina as they used to.Your horse may have poor body condition, such as a dull coat or decreased vitality.

"
Notice any redness or swelling.,
Look for discharge.,
Notice any changes in the appearance of the eyes.,
Identify the risk factors for corneal ulcers.,
Take action as soon as you recognize symptoms.",How to Spot Ulcer Symptoms in Horses3," One common symptom of corneal ulcers is redness of the eye. The area around the eye may also be swollen. The eye may be infected. The horse may have trouble opening or closing the eyelid, which may look like they’re squinting.If the horse has an injury to its eye, then the horse might try to protect it by holding the eye shut.

, Corneal ulcers may cause discharge from the eyes. This discharge may be clear or milky or white. It may be greenish or yellow, which can point to infection.The horse may have tears leaking from the eyes, or damp areas under the eyes to indicate tears.

, Another symptom of corneal ulcers is changes to the eyes or corneas. The surface of the eye may start to take on a cloudy or dull appearance, which changes the color of the horse’s eye.The ulcers may cause problems with the blood vessels, so the cornea may start to look bloody or dark red.

, Corneal ulcers occur from an injury to the eye. Your horse may get a corneal ulcer from running into something with their head or something entering or scraping the eye, like a branch or dust.If the horse gets into a violent altercation with another horse, it can cause a corneal ulcer if the eye is hit or damaged.
It may also be caused by a fungus or bacteria.

, Eyes can deteriorate and eye injuries can become very serious very quickly. If you see your horse has drainage from its eye, or the eye is swollen or being held shut, contact your veterinarian immediately. Eye injuries are considered emergencies and your vet will want to sedate the horse and look in the eye to find the specific cause of injury.

Do NOT put any medication in the eye until your doctor has confirmed whether it is an ulcer or not. If you put some medications in an eye with an ulcer this could make the eye much worse and potentially cause permanent damage."

Use the internet to find a good barn.,
Visit the barn before your lesson to talk to your instructor.,
Ask the instructor if you can borrow necessary gear.,
Sign release forms and make a payment.,
Wear long pants to protect your legs.,
Wear old boots with a heel.,
Drink plenty of water and wear sunscreen.,
Arrive at least 30 minutes before your lesson begins.",How to Ride a Horse for the First Time1," Most barns with lesson programs know that the internet is the best way for them to get the word out about what they can offer. Check out local barns’ websites to see pictures of their facilities and animals. Get ready to be excited about all the cute ponies! Be sure to also read user reviews to find out about other riders’ experiences at the barn.Choose a barn with a longstanding lesson program for your first ride. This will help you avoid any injuries or bad experiences as you get started with this new sport.;
, Once you’ve picked your spot, drive over and take a peek. This will help you get comfortable with the barn and the riding arenas. Call ahead to schedule a meeting with your instructor so you can chat about both of your expectations for the lesson.

Your instructor may also tell you which horse they’re planning to have you ride. Ask if the instructor would be willing to introduce you to the horse so you can start getting to know each other.

, During your in-person meeting or the phone call you use to schedule your lesson, ask about equipment. Riding gear is extremely expensive, and you don’t want to buy it unless you’ve fully committed to the sport. Most barns will have helmets available for lesson-ers, and they may also keep pairs of boots and half-chaps.If your barn doesn’t have helmets available, ask if they can put you in touch with a rider who’d be willing to let you borrow theirs. The helmet is the only absolutely necessary piece of equipment you’ll need for your first lesson, so if you can find one, you’re set. Avoid buying gear until you’ve ridden for at least two months.

, Most barns will require you (or, if you’re under 18, your parent or guardian) to sign release forms legally protecting them in case you’re injured. Don’t be alarmed by this form, as it’s standard procedure and doesn’t mean the barn thinks you’re in danger! Make a payment for the lesson when you sign these forms to help you and the barn keep your records straight., It’s important to protect your legs from friction when you ride. If it’s a hot day, you may be tempted to wear shorts or capris, but resist the urge! Stick with beat-up jeans that you don’t mind getting dirty., When you ride, you put your feet in what are called stirrups. A heel of no less than one inch (2.54 cm) will keep your feet from sliding in and out of the stirrups. This will help you keep your balance, which is especially important for your first ride., Just like any other sport, horseback riding will make you sweaty and thirsty. You’ll probably be riding outside if the weather is warm and dry. Make sure you’re hydrated and protected from the sun before you ride.Bring a water bottle along and ask your instructor if they’d be willing to keep it safe for you while you ride. If you get thirsty during the lesson, politely ask your instructor if they can grab your water bottle for you to take a quick water break.

, Before you ride, your instructor or a groom will need to groom and tack up your horse. It’s important for you to be there for this so you can get to know your horse and learn how to care for them yourself. This prep work generally takes about 15-20 minutes for experienced riders, so a half hour will give you some wiggle room."

Ensure your tack fits properly.,
When mounting a pony you do not need a mounting block, but if you can, ask someone to hold the stirrup on the other side so you don't hurt your pony, or move the saddle.,
Ride gently but firmly.,
Expect shorter, faster action.,
Make allowances for ponies while riding with horses.,
Make sure that you don't pull to much on the reins or it will hurt and maybe scare your pony.",How to Ride a Pony," Naturally, tack that fits a full-sized horse won't fit a pony, and riding in ill-fitting tack can be uncomfortable and even dangerous for both you and your pony. Some pony's tack will be made for children to use (often the stirrups will be the length used for a child).;
, You could also ask them to give you a leg-up., Special care must be taken to ride with a gentle seat and hands while riding ponies due to their small size, but firmness is required at points to convince them that you are the one riding.If you do not tell them where to go they will not know and may decide to not listen or buck/rear etc..

, Because ponies' legs are shorter, they take shorter strides, which are consequently more rapid. This can sometimes make their gaits feel more bumpy or even jarring. If you're used to riding horses, take time to get used to ponies' movement, and progress through the gaits slowly. Be careful when seeing a distance while jumping not to judge with a horse's stride in mind instead of a pony's. Make sure you are rising to the trot to a pony's stride, not a horse's

, As horses and ponies naturally wish to stay together in a herd, a pony may find it frustrating to be unable to keep up with the horses. Ask the riders of horses to slow down for you, or ride at a faster gait to keep up. Allow horses to pass you if they need to move quickly.

, To make sure you don't do this use your legs to push your pony over. The reason this works is the pony will want to move away from the pressure.

Find out what you are holding onto and why.,
Explain to your riding instructor why you feel insecure and why you prefer to hold the pommel or the horn.,
Learn that when you feel insecure, hold the cloth a little more until you feel confident.,
Try holding the cloth with only your little finger, this allows better control and allows you to simply release your little finger without thinking and grabbing hold again.,
Understand that when riding in a competition, you will need to understand that you will be disqualified for touching your saddle, so this will encourage you to let go.,
Ride by trotting and you will want to grab hold of the saddle again.,
Know that at canter or lope, you will want to hold on to the horn or pommel again, repeat the breathing exercises and gradually take your hand from the saddle to the mane.",How to Ride Without Depending on the Horn or the Pommel for Balance," Are you holding onto the pommel to stop your self from bouncing, or the horn to keep you from falling off?;
, They can help you conquer your fears, If you're holding onto the pommel of an English saddle, the process to let go is a little easier. First hold the saddle cloth rather than the saddle, this puts your whole body into a better position, you hand will be at a level that allows for better control.

, Each few days, gradually try to loosen your grip and have less fingers holding the cloth.

, Once you have let go completely, you can ride without a hand support. If you feel insecure, hold onto the mane this way you can still have maximum control, If holding on to the horn of a saddle (Western saddle) it takes a little more effort from the rider. Make sure you have already done steps 1 and 2 at the top of this page.

, But if your simply riding a western horse for pleasure, it will take a little more. To begin with, try to ride one handed, you may find that it is a little difficult if you're a novice or a beginner. If it is harder, try two hands at a walk. This will be easier to steer and stop.

, Try to refrain from doing so and instead sing a song. Think about what you want to do and how your going to do it. Look straight through the horses ears and breath 5 big breaths in and out.# After the 5th breath, stop and adjust yourself. Then do it again, this time take in 7 really big breaths hold for 2 seconds and breath out, repeat 7 times. After a while you will become more relaxed and be thinking of your breathing rather than holding on.

, And then finally from the mane to simply holding the reins.

Lead your horse to the riding ring.,
Mount up using a mounting block.,
Close your fingers around the reins.,
Keep your balance by using your heels and seat.,
Listen closely to your instructor to keep you and the horse safe.,
Cool down your horse for 10-15 minutes.,
Dismount on the left side of your horse.,
Give your horse a treat.",How to Ride a Horse for the First Time2," Be sure the horse’s reins are not lifted over their head. Stand on the left side of the horse and take both reins securely in your hands to form a lead line. Your right hand should be close to the horse’s chin, and your left hand should hold the rest of the reins to keep you and the horse from tripping over them. Walk forward and gently pull on the reins to get the horse to walk forward.Never look back at your horse if they’re not moving. Instead, cluck your tongue and say “walk on!” You can tug on the reins if they’re still resisting.
Never loop the reins around your hands. If the horse spooks and pulls, you could get hurt.

, Mounting blocks are large step stools that can be used to make mounting easier. Lead your horse up to the mounting block so the steps are located on its left side. Put the reins over the horse’s head and keep them in your left hand. Walk up the steps, and put your left foot in the left stirrup. Put your weight on this foot as you gently swing your right leg over the saddle.Avoid slamming your body weight down in the saddle. While experienced lesson horses may be used to this, it still isn’t comfortable for them. Keep your weight in your legs until you’re ready to slowly ease your bottom down into the saddle.

, Your fingers should be tight enough around the reins that they won’t slip through your fingers if the horse moves or pulls its head. Be careful not to jerk on the reins or lift your hands up sharply, as this may hurt your horse’s mouth.Don’t use the reins to keep your balance. This will also hurt your horse’s mouth, and you’ll lose your balance quickly if your horse moves or drops their head.

, Your stirrups should sit right under the balls of your feet, which are located at the front of your feet’s arches. This will help you automatically push your heels down, which will make you put your weight into your bottom and legs. This position will keep you balanced and secure in the saddle.Your stirrups should be long enough to create a natural bend in your knee. You shouldn’t be reaching for the stirrups with your feet, but they also shouldn’t be so short that they make your legs feel folded-up or cramped.

, During this first lesson, pay careful attention to your instructor. They’re going to teach you several basic body and voice commands that can be used to get the horse to move forward, stop, turn, walk, and maybe trot. Your instructor will also help you position your body to feel comfortable and safe in the saddle. Be patient with this basic lesson, as it’s a building-block for anything that comes next.If you’re ever feeling nervous or scared, tell your instructor right away. Don’t try to tough it out. Horses are sensitive animals, and they’ll respond to your emotions.

, While your horse probably didn’t get very winded or sweaty during your lesson, it’s a good idea to get in the habit of cooling down by walking them slowly around the riding ring. This will allow the horse’s warm muscles to cool down slowly, preventing stiffness and injury. It will also give you time to take and breath and relax with your horse.You’ll know when your horse is cooled down by resting your hand on their neck. If it doesn’t feel much warmer than the air temperature, you’re ready to go.

, Once you’re completely finished with your lesson, stop in the middle of the ring. Put your left hand on the reins, and swing your right leg over the saddle to dismount. Pull the horse’s reins over their head to lead them safely back to the barn., It’s important to thank your horse for their hard work. You can give your horse a carrot, a piece of apple, a sugar cube, or a horse treat that the barn provides. In order to feed them the treat, put it in the middle of your hand and bring your hand up to their mouth. Keep your palm flat and your fingers together. You don’t want the horse to mistake your pinky for a second carrot!"
"
Shadow your instructor to learn how to care for the horse.,
Secure the horse in cross-ties.,
Groom your horse before and after you ride.,
Tack up your horse using English or Western gear.,
Remove the tack after your lesson.,
Clean your tack to make it last longer.",How to Ride a Horse for the First Time3," Since this is your first ride, you won’t know exactly what to do, even if you read up about grooming and tacking online. Don’t be embarrassed! Your instructor or the barn groom will be happy to let you observe and participate safely to learn what you’re supposed to do for the next time., Your instructor will halter your horse by standing on the horse’s left side, putting the horse’s nose through the halter, and gently pulling the top of the halter over their ears. Halters have small metal squares located on each side of the horse’s face. Most barns have wide aisles with long lead lines, or cross-ties, hanging down on either side that can be attached to the halter’s metal squares to let you safely groom and tack up.When your horse is in cross-ties, always walk around the front, rather than the back of the horse. This will keep you from being kicked. You also shouldn’t stand directly in front of the horse, as they can’t see you there. Stand slightly to the side of their face to get in their line of vision., Horses love rolling around in their stalls and paddocks to itch themselves. Your itchy horse may be covered in dirt and hay. Cleaning this off before you ride will help your horse be more comfortable while you ride. It’s also important to clean off sweat marks and dirt once you’re done with your lesson.Grooming can be scary for first-time riders. Tell your instructor any time you’re nervous. Picking feet can be especially difficult for beginners, so ask your instructor to show you how to do this before you do it yourself.
If your horse is especially dirty or sweaty, you may need to to hose off, sponge, or bathe your horse. This probably won’t be necessary unless it’s a very hot summer day, and you usually only need to bathe after you ride.

, Because this is your first time and properly secured gear is really important for safety, your instructor or the groom will tack up your horse for this lesson. No matter which style you’re riding, there are several basic pieces of gear required for tacking up. Watch closely so you’re ready to do it yourself next time., Once you’re finished riding, your tack can be removed in the same order it was put on the horse. Put your tack to the side once you’ve taken it off. Lots of barns have hooks and stands for this. You can also gently lean it against the barn wall., When you clean dirt, grass, and other grime off tack, you’ll not only make it nice for the next rider, you’ll also prevent the leather tack from cracking or breaking. Use a dampened sponge and some saddle soap to wipe down any leather. Run a different wet cloth or toothbrush over the bit to remove any gunk or debris. Use a soft, dry cloth to completely dry the leather once it’s clean."

You don't need to do heaps and make your horse tied which is what some people do, but that isn't right! You only need to do a little bit of groundwork! The second thing you will want to do is mount your horse correctly! Many people are intimidated by the idea of mounting a horse but if you stay calm it should be fun and easy.









If you're a first time rider, it's not a bad idea to use a mounting block. This is a small wooden structure that you can use to stand on in order to mount the horse. Most people can't mount straight from the ground right away.You should also ask someone to hold the horse's head as you mount. It is much easier to use a mounting block if you are a beginner as it is a bit of a stretch to get your foot into the stirrup and then pull yourself up from there. Using a mounting block also puts less pressure on a horse's back.
Mount the horse from its left near side. Place your left foot in the left stirrup and pull your body upward. Swing your other leg around the horse's body, sort of hugging the horse with your leg, and insert your right foot into the right stirrup.
Select a well-trained horse if you're a beginner. Horses that are younger or poorly trained may shift and move during mounting, which can prove difficult to even an advanced rider. Choose an older horse that has a reputation for being calm and cooperative during riding.
If someone doesn't hold the horse's head as you mount, you should hold the reins tightly in your left hand, but not so tightly that the horse backs away from the pressure;
, Once you're in the saddle, take a moment to make sure you're in the proper position for balance. Keep your back straight. Keep in mind when you ride a horse you should be able to draw a straight line through your ear, shoulder, hip, and heel. Keep your shoulders even and straight as well, with the bulk of your weight resting on your seat bones in your buttocks., Once you feel securely balanced, get your legs into the proper position. This can be particularly difficult for beginning riders so take time to make sure your legs are positioned properly. Keep your heels right under your hips.


Your legs should be turned inward. Many beginning riders have their legs turned outward, as this can feel more natural, with their knees sticking out. Remember, you're sort of hugging the horse with your legs. You shouldn't squeeze the horse too tightly, but have your legs curved inwards towards the horse.When you're riding a horse, your toes should be pointed upward. Keep your ankles stable and your heels pointing downward. An easy stretch or practice for this is to stand on something higher than the ground or even a staircase and push your heels down keeping the balls of your feet on the staircase., Once your legs are in the right position, make sure you're holding the reins properly. How you hold the reins depends on whether you're riding English or Western.









For English style, make a fist and then pass the reins through the fist so the loop of the reins faces upward. Then, remove both your pinky fingers from the fist and place them on the outside of the reins. Place your thumbs on top of the reins, securing them in place.In Western, the reins do not form a loop. The western bridle has reins that are knotted at the top. Keep the reins loose at all times and hold them in two fists with you thumbs up like your doing a thumbs up., When riding English style, there are a variety of ways you can signal your horse to move. Familiarize yourself with the various ways to get your horse to move.









Starting off, try gently squeezing your horses side with your legs. This should signal your horse to walk.If your horse does not respond to this, he may need further prompting. You can gently kick your horse with your heels. Do not kick too hard, however. While horses have thick hides, they may experience pain if you kick with too much force. A gentle tapping is generally all it takes to get a horse to walk.Verbal cues also help in some cases. Depending on how a horse was trained, he may respond to clicking of the tongue and other noises. Ask the horse's trainer if there are any noises he responds to., When a horse walks, canters, or gallops, his head moves back and forth with the rhythm of his body. Allow your hands to bob back and forth with the horse's head. Not following the horse's movements can cause discomfort to the horse's mouth. It can also confuse a horse as pulling back on the reins is generally a sign to stop.







, It's important you learn how to steer your horse. Steering in English style if fairly self explanatory.









You keep more contact with the horses mouth while riding English. To signal the horse to turn right, very lightly pull back with your right hand. To signal the horse to turn left, very lightly pull back with your left hand. If the horse does not respond to the lighter pulling, you can gradually begin to pull slightly harder until the horse responds.You should also use your legs and body to signal a horse to move. Looking in the direction you wish to move helps. Horse's can feel your seat bones move. You should also gently squeeze your legs to signal a horse to change direction. For example, squeeze your left leg if you want your horse to turn right as the horse will want to move away from the pressure., Once you're confident at the walk, gently press your legs into the horses sides to cue the horse to trot. Sit deep in the saddle and keep contact with your legs. Be careful to keep your elbows relaxed, so you don't jerk on your horse's mouth.








Some riders prefer to do a ""posting trot"" as opposed to a sitting trot. This can be more comfortable as a trot is a bouncing gait. To do a ""posting trot"" simply rise when the horses outside shoulder moves forwards, and gently sit back down in the saddle, as to avoid bouncing heavily on the horses back. , Cantering is a quicker three-beat speed that's natural to all horses. When you canter, your seat will roll with the canter and you stay in the position you normally ride in. Before you canter, make sure you are comfortable with both posting trot and sitting trot as both of these are major key points. Getting the timing right to get a horse to canter takes time.


Try not to tense up. Most beginners will find it beneficial to hold onto a saddle or neck strap while learning to canter to help with their balance so they don't fall.
If your horse just moves into a faster trot when you signal it to canter, ask your horse to walk and continue asking him to canter from the walk instead of the trot. Before learning to canter make sure you know posting trot, sitting trot, medium trot, collected trot and a half hault in a trot. Before cantering, gently squeeze your outside rein to slow your horse to a half hault in a trot before using your inside leg by the girth and then soon adding your outside leg behind the girth to give your horse a bit of a push forward.

, Galloping, jumping, and dressage tricks are all fun to learn in English style. However, you should hold off until you've mastered the basics. Spend at least a few months practicing the above techniques before trying anything new. Galloping and jumping especially can be dangerous if you're inexperienced., Steering is slightly different in Western style than it is in English style When riding Western, you use a technique called ""neck reining.""


Neck reining means you hold the reins loosely and gently touch the horse's neck to signal movements. For the most part, you'll be neck reining when riding Western.To turn right, move the reins across the horse's neck to the right. To go left, move the reins across the horse's neck to the left.Always hold the reins in your left hand. Keep your right hand on the front of your saddle.As with English riding, make sure you use your full body to steer as well. Use your legs and seat bones in addition to your hands.

, If you need to steer your horse quickly, it's recommended you momentarily switch to English style steering. If your horse is not responding to neck reining, grab the reins in both hands. Gently pull or squeeze the left rein to turn left and the right rein to turn right., Start out walking gently. In Western, you also squeeze or kick your horse to get him to walk. You should follow the motion of his head again, but as you hold the reins looser you might not move your hands as much as you would in English.







, While your horse is walking, squeeze his sides gently to signal to him to jog. Trotting is not usually a part of Western style riding.


A jog is a slow, steady gait. It's a little quicker paced than a walk but not as jaunty as an English trot.You can easily sit in a Western jog. Posting trot is not necessary when riding western style., Horseback riding can be very difficult and takes a lot of time and patience. Try to find a reputable stable in your area and take lessons from an established trainer. It's a good idea to have supervision when beginning to take riding lessons as riding can be dangerous if you're untrained.

, Horses are groomed somewhat differently, depending on whether they're kept indoors or outdoors. Always refer to the instructions and the guidelines given at the stable where you're riding. There are some general rules, however. You should usually groom a horse before riding him.


Use a body brush to brush the horse's fur all over its body, removing the dust, sweat and loose hair from the horses coat. Use the mane-and-tail comb on the mane and tail, appropriately.Next, use a dandy brush on the body and legs of the horse, removing mud and sweat. This brush has harder bristles, which shouldn't be used on the face, mane, or tail of the horse.
Use the hoof pick to remove mud, dirt, and pebbles from the horse's hooves. If this is not done before you ride, your horse may get a sore foot and go lame.
Use a rubber or plastic curry comb on the body of the horse for removing loose hair and mud from the horses coat. Metal curry combs are used for removing loose hair from horses that are shedding heavily.

, Before you ride, a horse needs to be outfitted with a saddle and bridle. Learn how to tack up a horse if you're interested in horseback riding.


To saddle a horse, position the saddle blanket above the horse's withers and push it back toward the hind-legs to move the hairs in a comfortable direction. Position the saddle in the middle of the blanket.
Attach the cinch or girth and tighten it gently, allowing the horse enough room to exhale comfortably. You should be able to fit two fingers under the cinch or girth, but no more.
Make sure you've got a bridle appropriate for your horse's size. Gently place the bit near the horses mouth. Most horses will open their mouths as they're used to bridles, but if your horse doesn't gently push your fingers into the sides of the horse's mouth. Slip the bit in slowly, then slip the top of the bridle over the horse's ears. Secure all the straps and buckles, buckling tight enough that you can only comfortably fit one finger under the straps.

Start by learning how to walk.,
Start trotting!,
Learn how to canter.","How to Ride a Horse at Walk, Trot, and Canter"," The walk is a slow gait with a gentle rocking motion. In the walk, the horse steps with his left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, and then right front leg. This makes the walk a four-beat gait - you can count 1-2-3-4 as you walk. At the walk, you must keep the muscles in your upper body supple and relaxed, so that they absorb the horse's motion. Don't let your seat or lower leg slip! Because the horse swings his head at the walk, allow your hands to gently move back and forth with the movement.


The walk has the least natural impulsion (energy) of all three gaits. You must be careful to keep your horse moving forward in a lively, energetic attitude. To keep your horse going forward, give him short, brisk squeezes with your legs. If he's being particularly lazy, you can give him a quick, purposeful kick.;
, In the trot, the horse steps with diagonal pairs of legs - for example, the left hind leg and right foreleg move together. The trot is a two-beat gait. You should begin by just trotting five steps. Keep your hips, knees, and ankles supple and springy, and again absorb the movement through your seat. Imagine that you are melting down into the saddle, so that your seat becomes deep and heavy. When you can sit the trot comfortably, you can begin posting. To post, you rise up with one beat of the trot, and sit down the next. Keep an even pressure on your stirrups, and allow the horse to move you.


To post the trot correctly, you must rise up as the horse's outside leg (the leg closest to the arena fence) moves forward. If you ""rise and fall with the leg on the wall,"" you are on the correct diagonal.

, The canter is three-beat gait with a rocking motion. The horse moves his right rear leg, then his left rear and right front legs (the right rear leg will move again a moment later), and then the left front leg. To transition from trot to canter, sit down, breathe and deepen your seat, and then move your outside leg back and squeeze. You should also bend your horse a little with your inside rein. It is important that your horse is moving with impulsion before you ask for the canter! Once you've begun cantering, allow your seat to deepen and follow the horse. Imagine that you are cleaning the saddle with your seat - allow it to move in slow, steady circles.


Once you are proficient at the canter, you will have to learn about leads. See this article for more information.

Asking your horse to walk.,

Asking your horse to trot.,
Going rising/posting trot.,
Asking your horse to canter after a few lessons with an instructor.",How to Ride a Horse (the Basics)," This is done from the left side by putting your left foot into the stirrup and lifting your right leg over. You can also use a mounting block or a friend to help you up. Remember to always fasten the girth (a ""belt"" which keeps the saddle in place), otherwise the saddle may tip over. Land softly on the seat, so you won't startle or hurt the horse.;
, Your stirrups should be about the length of your arm. You can measure your stirrups by putting the stirrup irons basically on your armpit and making sure your hand comes close to the stirrup bars. Do this while you are dismounted.

, Make a clucking sound and squeeze his sides slightly with both of your legs. The right place is just behind the girth. If he doesn't respond, you will have to squeeze a little harder.

, It's very important to know how to stop your horse or tell him to slow down. This is done by leaning very slightly back, saying ""woah"" (if it helps) ,and pulling the reins. Be sure you aren't squeezing with your legs, so you don't give mixed signals.

, Your horse will turn left, when you squeeze with your right leg and slightly take your left hand to the left, to direct him. When you want to turn right, the aids are mirrored.

, Trotting is easy, but you shouldn't progress into faster gaits until you're confident with your ability to control the horse. When you want the horse to trot, you simply squeeze him with both of your legs and cluck. Again, if he doesn't respond repeat your aids, but make them a little harder. You may also kick the horse with both of your legs lightly if it still doesn't respond.

, There are two types of trots, the sitting trot and the rising/posting trot. Sitting trot is sitting in the saddle and absorbing the bounce of the trot, but rising trot is easier. In rising trot you go up in every second step and on every other step you sit down. Trot is naturally bouncy, so it gives you momentum to get up. You basically push yourself up with your legs and stand on the stirrups for one step. The pace of the trot is quite fast, so you will basically be going up-down-up-down and so forth.The horse's pace will let you be lifted. Just go with the flow and don't rise higher than the horse sends you.

, Never learn to ride a horse alone. It's dangerous, and instructors can teach you the correct way to canter. The canter is the second fastest gait of the horse, after gallop. Cantering is quite a bit faster than the trot, but some think it's easier to sit in canter than it is in the sitting trot. You should start practicing canter only when you're on a steady horse and under supervision. The aids used to ask for canter are simple, you push your outside leg backward, toward the horse's rear and keep your inside leg on the girth and use the inside rein to bend the horse to the inside keeping the outside rein firm. Then you just squeeze with both of your legs and make a kissing sound. Be sure you are on the correct lead. You can tell if you're on the right lead if the horse's inside hoof reaches farther than the outside hoof."

If it’s your horse’s first or second time riding on the beach, being with other confident horses helps keep your horse calm. This is very helpful because many horses are afraid of the ocean the first time they see it.;
, Horses become alarmed if there are a lot of people and noises in a concentrated area. Going to the beach when there are few people is best. Not only does this minimize your horse’s exposure to stimulation, but it minimizes how many obstacles your horse has if it gets loose.A spooked horse is a hazard to itself and other beachgoers.
Go to the beach in the early morning or late evening, or on weekdays.
Avoid going to a popular beach in the middle of the day on a weekend.

, Horses don’t usually like to go directly into the water, especially on one of their first beach trips. Choose a time of day when the waves are low, usually at low tide. Low tide also helps because it usually reveals a strip of firm sand that is good for horses to walk on.It also helps to go on a day that isn’t windy because it minimizes waves.

, If it is one of your first times to ride your horse on the beach, your horse is likely a bit afraid of the water. Let your horse get acclimated to the beach before urging it into the sea. Try riding your horse in circles in the sand, getting closer to the water each time around.If it is your first time, your horse may not want to go near the water at all.
It may take several trips before you can urge your horse into the water.

, Be patient with a nervous horse and don’t force it into the water. Once your horse seems ok with going into the sea, go at a slow walk. Horses sometimes get knocked off balance when waves hit their legs, so be ready to steady your horse with the reins and your legs.If your horse puts his nose down in the water like they are going to roll, discourage this by pulling up their head and urging them forward with your legs.
If your horse wants to roll in the shallow water and you don’t mind getting wet, you can let them roll. Just be careful to get out of the way.

, For your part, avoid wearing riding boots or anything that gets heavy or damaged when wet (like leather). Instead, wear light clothes you don’t mind getting wet in. As for your horse, you may want to ride bareback. If you do use a saddle, make sure the stirrups are easy to get out of.Using light stirrups is necessary for getting out quickly in case of a difficult situation in the water.
Don’t forget your riding helmet.

, When you get home, do a few things to refresh your horse. Rub it down with clean water to wash away salt water and sand. Clean any scratches and cuts because salt water contains microbes that can cause infection. Feed your horse small amounts of oats and hay over a few hours after they have cooled down.Also be sure to immediately wipe down and dry out any leather that got wet. Rub on a conditioner for leather.

, Before setting off to the beach, make sure your horse responds to your commands at home or in the arena. If your horse won’t listen to you at home, it certainly won’t listen when surrounded by the many sounds of the waves, other people, or other horses.Use short commands like “whoa” and “walk.”Use a calm but firm tone of voice. Horses will not answer to anger or shouting.

, Before overwhelming your horse with a large amount of water at the beach, try getting them used to water at home. If you have trails nearby, find one with a rushing stream. Practice walking your horse through this small amount of water.Creeks are also excellent water areas to test your horse out on.
Approach the creek or stream carefully, urging them to cross slowly.
If your horse gets spooked, don’t force them to go into the water. Just keep exposing them to it.

, At the beach, you need to be prepared to keep your horse hydrated and fed. Bring your own source of water since ocean water is salt water. You also don’t know what kind of access to water you will find at different beaches.Also pack fresh hay for your horse to munch on. If your horse is rewarded while at the beach, they will start to associate the beach with good things.

, If you’re riding bareback at the beach, you need a way to lead your horse. Leaving on the halter under the bridle with a lead rope you can easily attach allows you to keep tabs on your horse when you’re not on it. Also use split reins so that the horse doesn’t trip while swimming., Make sure that you shoe the horse’s feet properly and then check their feet carefully after you get home. Sand can wear away hoof tissue in a big way. You may even want to put boots on your horse.Remove and wash any leg wraps or boots after you get home.

, Not all beaches allow horses. In fact, many of them don’t allow horses at all. Look up local beaches online to read about their rules. You can also try calling a local beach and talking to the rangers about your desire to ride a horse on the beach. Some beaches section off areas where horses can ride.
Many beaches require a permit to ride a horse on the beach. In Florida, some permit seekers have to take a brief training course on protected species.In Florida, there is no requirement that you clean up your horse’s waste.

, Once you locate a beach that allows horseback riding, find out what permits you need. The rules may be different depending on what type of rider you are. Riders who live by a beach and intend to ride often may need to take a training class. Riders who only want a permit for a day may not need a class.In St. John’s county in Florida, for example, there are three permit levels: master, general class 1, and general class 2.
You may have to watch a training video, take a quiz, and sign an application.

, Make sure the beach you find has a lot of room for parking. You need to be able to park your horse trailer. Parking lots with spots for boats, like you see at marinas, are useful for this., Try to choose a beach with low waves, especially when you first start riding your horse at the beach. High waves can be loud and disconcerting for a horse. Low waves are much easier for them to handle.If you can’t find a beach with low waves, at least go at low tide and on a day that isn’t windy.

, Horses need a firm surface to ride on. Try to find a beach with sand instead of rocks and pebbles. You may be able to find boots for horses if you can’t find a sandy beach., If you don’t have your own horse for beach riding, you can go to a horseback riding company and pay to ride one on the beach. Many cities in coastal areas have companies that offer trainers and horses for a beach riding experience.


This is especially useful if you live far away from an ocean beach.
Some companies will offer you the full experience for a little over $100."

Garlic:- ""Allium sativum"" The most important portmanteau herb. Natural antibiotic with the huge advantage that it is selective and only kills pathogens.It is the greatest disease preventative and fighter being anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-parasitic.
Rosehips:- ""Rosa canina"" Another portmanteau herbs, Rosehips should be given as part of a natural diet. It has an enormous Vitamin C level as well as a vast array of other vitamins and a high mineral count. A broad general tonic good for rehabilitation after any stress, illness or injury, an immune system booster, a circulatory herb especially beneficial for the bridge between arterial and venous circulation which is one main reason it promotes strong, healthy hoof growth and is good for the lungs. Advanced benefits if made into a Tea.
Chamomile:-

;
, If a horse is prone to nervous tension, and gut tension, such as Diarrhea, or if a horse has a low immune system from recently getting over a cold or illness. If you just want to improve your horses well-being, or if you want to prevent the setting in of an illness or virus.

, To correctly dose your horse, even for basic herbs, you still need to take into consideration the variables. You wouldn't give a miniature pony 2 cups of Garlic and only give a Warmblood 1 cup. Be realistic with your dosages, the smaller the horse, the smaller the dose rate.

,
Gender: Some herb's such as Cod Liver Oil can cause flirtatious behavior in female horses. While some other herbs may boost fertility and productivity in stallions and brood mares.
Age: Younger horses should get a smaller dose, so their body can handle it, just like a smaller breed of horse. You wouldn't gibe a 6 month old Warm blood (which is the size of a full grown welsh section A at the best of times) the amount of herbs you would give a Full Grown Warm Blood.
Height and Body Size: As stated above, the smaller the horse, the smaller the dose. Bear in mind though, a fatter pony or a skinny Hack will need to be dosed to suit it's body frame and weight. There are slight variables within the body weight, but keep to the Breed rule, and don't overdose.
Breed: Some breeds of horses don't require certain minerals and vitamins. Though, this also depends on location of where they are pastured and kept.
Pasture/Up Keep: If a horse is stabled all day and all night, then supplemental herbs are a must. If a horse is paddocked all day and night, then the horse will need sufficient herbal replacement to replace anything that will have been sweated out, or that he wouldn't be able to get naturally.
Activity: A Pleasure or Trail horse wouldn't need as much herbal supplements, as compared to a Hunter Hack or a Performance Show Jumper or Eventer. This is also the case with Western Performance and Horses that are used for strenuous activity. Show Jumper horses and Eventers take breaks before each new event, whereas Performance and Long Distance Treks need additional supplements to maintain salt and mineral levels.
Natural Behavior: A horse that is simply used as a paddock companion will require less herbal supplements then that of a working horse.
Temperament: Some hers can relax horses, just as much as some herbs can heat horses up. You wouldn't feed a slow School Horse or pony herbs to calm it down, just as you wouldn't feed a Thoroughbred Racehorse or Ex-Racehorse herbs that will heat them up.



, An example for the three main Equine Size groups follows.




Pony - Because ponies are a smaller size, ranging from miniatures and fella bellas, all the way to 13.3 hands it shows that every horse isn't the same. For a miniature horse or any breed that is measured in inches, a dosage rate should be evaluated by an Equine Herbalist as they are very small and excessive amounts of particular herbs can cause adverse reactions to their health. For these horses, follow the guide listed, however, half it and dose over a whole day in intervals, (i.e. not in one feed). For a pony that is measured in hands, from 9 hands through to 13.3 hands, the ideal amount for a healthy horse that does not require any medicinal increases is about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic, about 1 teaspoon Rosehips and 1/2 cup Chamomile made into a tea with about 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of water. If you wish to improve their coat condition then the following amounts would be suitable. 3 to 5 ml Cod Liver Oil and the same in Liquid Seaweed Meal.
Galloway - These sized horses range from 14 to 15 hands. A 13.3. hand pony may be included if they are of a stockier QH build. On the other scale, a 15.1 hand horse of Stock Horse and Riding Pony build may be dosed as a Galloway. Generally following the same rule as for ponies, if a Galloway is in need to a medical treatment, then you are able to increase certain herbs, however, for personal relief seek advice from a Vet and/or Equine Herbalist and/or Experienced Horse Person with experience in Herbal remedies. 1 teaspoon of Garlic, (can be increased to Hack dose if the horse has a cold), 2 teaspoon Rosehips (can be increased to 3 if horse has a cold or if horse has laminitis), 1 cup of Chamomile made into a tea with 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of hot water. (If the horse has a gastro problem you can safely increase the dose by 1/2 cup, increase the water also by 1/2 liter) Cod Liver oil should be administered at the dose of 5 to 10 ml per day, as would be Liquid Seaweed meal.
Hack - A hack horse is 15 Hands or higher. If you have a Warmblood or a horse that is taller than 16.3 hands, then a higher dose is required as they are a much larger horse. 2 teaspoons Garlic, 2 to 3 teaspoons Rosehips, 1 to 2 cups Chamomile made into a tea with 1 to 2 liters (0.3 to 0.5 US gal) of hot water. For Cod Liver oil, the dose should be 10 to 15ml per day, seaweed meal now changes to a maximum of 10ml per day, unless advised from an Equine Herbalist as some brands are stronger. An additional product that has the same benefits and composition as Seaweed meal is Equilibrium, the dose rates are listed on pack.



, You should see a positive response. Many people say that herbs take at least a week to take effect and for results to be seen, but this differs from person to person. In many cases, the response form Chamomile is fast, with Garlic being within a few days as with Rosehips. Cod Liver oil is within days however, it will depend on the dose rate and how much work your horse is in. If you are working your horse while feeding garlic, very soon you may find a sweet garlic smell, this is the effect of the garlic in conjunction with the fluid loss from natural sweating. This process which is sped up when sweating, will mean that any biting insects from flies to bots etc will be greeted with an unpleasant small and taste.

, It is best to take a before and after photo shot from all directions sides, front and back. So as you can see if the herbs have had an effect. It is hard to tell most of the time as the telltale signs are subtle and each day you may not notice the change.

Avoid pulling your hand away as you feed the horse.,
Feed the horse treats in a bucket or feeding trough.",How to Hand Feed a Horse," If you see some horses grazing in a pasture on the side of the road, don’t assume you can simply approach the fence and offer them food. You must always as the owner’s permission before approaching or feeding any horses that do not belong to you.Some horses might be on a very specific diet, and offering them food outside of that diet could be harmful. Alternatively, some horses may have biting tendencies or aggressive behaviors, and you don’t want to approach any horse without being aware of these tendencies beforehand.;
, Never run at a horse. Do not come at him from behind, as you might spook him. Approach the horse from the front, and off to the side a bit. Approaching at a slight angle will allow him to see you a bit better.Don’t approach a horse directly from the front. Make sure you are coming to him from the side a bit as that is where his best vision is. Walk slowly and don’t lunge towards him or make any sudden movements.

, Talking softly, clicking your tongue, or speaking the horse’s name will let him know you are approaching. You might see his ears twitch as he hears your voice, and he may turn to look at you when he hears you. This will let you know he has acknowledged your presence and you haven’t startled him.Don’t make any strange or overly loud noises to let the horse know you’re there. Just speak quietly or make noises he is used to hearing.

, When offering a horse food with your hand, you want to make sure your hand is flat with the food or treat on your palm. Doing this will keep your fingertips away from the horse’s mouth, and he will be less likely to accidentally nip you while taking the food.Avoid holding your hand too high. Let the horse drop his head down to take the treat from your palm. That way, he will be reaching down into your palm rather than coming straight onto your fingertips.

, Horses particularly love apples and carrots, but you can also offer a myriad of other things, including melons, snow peas, pumpkin, and strawberries. You can also choose to offer treats made specifically for horses that can be purchased at horse supply stores.For a sweet treat, you can even offer the horse a few peppermint candies or sugar cubes. Make sure you only give these occasionally, and only a few at a time.

, Some horses might chew and swallow the treats you give them, while others might be more prone to swallow without chewing. Breaking up larger pieces will prevent anything from getting stuck in the horse’s throat.Watch the horse as he eats his treats to assure he doesn’t have trouble chewing or eating whatever you have chosen to feed him.

, Things like potatoes, onions, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage should be avoided. Horses are prone to bloat which could lead to health complications, so you don’t want to feed them things that could lead to excessive gas.Avoid giving your horse raw garlic. Garlic is sometimes given to horses in supplement form, or incorporated into certain kinds of feed, but should not be given raw as a treat.
Chocolate is also a bad treat choice for horses. The same chemical that makes chocolate toxic to dogs also makes it toxic to horses in large amounts. Still, a tiny piece now and then won’t do much harm.

, Overfeeding treats adds unnecessary calories and could disrupt the bacteria and microbes present in a horse’s digestive tract that are balanced to keep things working properly.As an alternative to treats, you can hand feed a horse his regular feed, or handfuls of the grass he likely spends most of his day munching on out in the pasture.

, If you associate a hand-fed treat with a verbal cue, the horse will eventually learn to only expect a treat when the word is spoken, rather than all the time. This will discourage them from constantly nudging or nipping for treats.Speaking a word like “Treat!” when you want to give your horse a treat will help him wait for this cue to expect a treat.

, Rather than standing in front of the horse and offering a treat to him outright, stand beside him and face in the same direction as him. Hold the treat in the palm of your hand and reach a little over to his other side. This will force him to turn his head slightly away from you to take the treat.Doing this will teach the horse to expect hand-fed treats in this manner, and the horse will be less likely to nip or nudge people for treats.

, Rather than pulling your hand back towards yourself as the horse takes the treat from your palm, guide the treat into the horse’s mouth and direct your hand toward him instead.Pulling your hand away might signal to the horse that you are going to withdraw the treat, which might cause them to lunge for it in an attempt to get it before you take it away. This could lead to an accidental nip or bite.

, If a certain horse has particularly bad hand-feeding manners, stick to feeding that horse with a bucket or feeding trough. This will generally be the safest way to feed a horse.Hand feeding is sometimes frowned upon in the horse-owner community because of the nipping behaviors it can occasionally create or foster. If your horse has a tendency towards these behaviors, feeding the horse treats in a bucket or feeding trough is a safe alternative."

No matter if your horse is healthy or ill, it’s important for the animal’s wellbeing to always carefully watch your horse’s physical state and emotional demeanor. These can cue you in to potential signs of colic in your horse.Look for the following general signs and symptoms of colic in a horse:


Anxiety or depression
Pawing at the ground
Looking at the flank
Rolling or wanting to lie down
Playing in the water bucket but not drinking
Absence of defecation
Lack of appetite
Excessive sweating
Unusually high pulse rate of over 50 beats per minute
Absence of normal gut noises
Frequent attempts to urinateCurling the upper lip
Backing into a corner
Kicking at the abdomen;
, One of the four primary types of colic affecting horses, spasmodic colic is pain caused by excess gas in the horse’s gut or an inability to pass gas. Spasmodic colic is most often caused by a change in diet, lack of roughage, or parasites. It is often accompanied by mild symptoms including:Sweating
Occasional gut pain
Loud gut noises
Restlessness
Anxiety
Frequent attempts to roll, Another common form of horse colic, impaction colic happens when there is a blockage in the intestines.It can also be caused by dehydration or heavy parasitism.If left untreated, impaction colic can be fatal for a horse.The following signs may indicate impaction colic in your horse:


Lack of feces or fecal production
Chronic abdominal pain
Dark mucous membranes
Unwillingness to eat
Extended periods of laying down
Impacted colon
Decreased temperature, This type of colic is present mostly in horses that graze on sandy pastures or where limited grazing is available. Sand colic develops when a horse ingests too much sand and dirt. This can lead to impaction or irritation of the bowel lining.Your horse may have sand colic if it exhibits the following symptoms:


Diarrhea
Depression
Lack of or decrease in appetite
Weight loss, Horses have very complex gastrointestinal tracts and individual organs may twist on one another. This very serious condition leads to an interruption in the blood supply, or ischemia. Twisted gut colic is usually very painful for a horse and requires emergency surgery.Your horse may have twisted gut if it exhibits the following symptoms:


Extreme discomfort
Rolling
Inability or unwillingness to stand up, If you detect any signs of colic in your horse or are concerned the animal may have the condition, contact your vet immediately. Remember that many types of colic can be fatal for a horse if left untreated.Give your vet any information about symptoms your horse is exhibiting, how long the animal has had them, as well as any questions about what you should do until the vet arrives., Your vet will likely give you instruction on what to do for your horse until the doctor arrives. These measures can keep your horse comfortable during the waiting time. The most common treatments normally entail walking the horse and no access to food.Walk your horse only if it makes the animal comfortable. Make sure to walk it at a slow pace and not until the point of exhaustion. Stop walking your horse if it appears to cause pain or if you detect any rib pain, foot pain, or other muscle pain.

, When your vet arrives, he or she will perform a basic examination. The vet will assess the horse’s pulse, respiration and temperature. After this your vet will determine the most likely type of colic your horse has. Be aware that it is unusual to diagnose the exact cause of horse colic.Allow your vet to sedate your horse if necessary to perform a rectal exam. The rectal exam gives your vet valuable information concerning gas buildup, intestinal obstruction or a possible twist, all of which can make a difference in the type of treatment prescribed., No matter what type of colic your vet determines that your horse has, your vet will administer an analgesic to relieve your horse’s discomfort. Pain relievers such as flunixin meglumine (banamine) can help control the horse’s discomfort for a few hours at a time., If your vet determines that the horse has gas or fluid buildup, he or she may suggest relieving the pressure. This involves passing a nasogastric tube through your horse's nose into his stomach. The tube gives gas and other fluids a way to travel away from the horse’s gut.Be aware that your horse may require sedation to insert a nasogastric tube. Provide your vet any assistance required to calm and restrain your horse.Place a towel over the horse’s nose if it is bleeding. Don’t be alarmed if the bleeding is severe as this is normal.

, Your vet may determine that your horse’s colic is caused by some type of impaction—either fecal or parasite. This generally requires dislodging the impaction with mineral oil or laxatives.If the impaction is due to parasites, your vet will administer medication to kill the parasites.Have the vet give lubricants or fecal-softening agents through a stomach tube. These soften the impaction and may be used in conjunction with IV fluids.Encourage motility, or getting fluids to move through your horse’s system, by having it walk.This may help your horse more quickly defecate.
Avoid feeding your horse grain and hay until it has a bowel movement. You can allow the horse to graze on fresh grass when walking, all of which may stimulate the horse’s bowels.

, In addition to removing an impaction, your horse may receive oral or IV fluids to rehydrate its body or if it is in shock.Your horse may need reexamination after getting IV fluids to determine if it is still dehydrated or in shock, or to see if the impaction is gone.


Be aware that your horse may get fluids through a stomach tube or IV catheter. Your doctor may recommend these fluids for several days until the horse’s intestinal function has returned and your horse can maintain its fluids by drinking.Your vet may administer approximately one gallon of mineral oil, plus some water. This acts as a laxative and helps the body break down the excess gas as well.

, If your horse has damage to its intestinal wall or there is toxicity in its intestinal wall or system, your vet may administer antibodies or other medication. These can prevent or counteract bacterial toxins in the intestine or bloodstream., If your horse has a mechanical obstruction or twisted gut, it may require surgery. This treatment is used only in the most extreme cases and generally must be done quickly to save a horse’s life.Be aware that surgery generally requires that you take the horse to an equine hospital equipped for abdominal surgery and follow-up intensive care.Aftercare from surgery can take months.
Understand that the outcome of your horse’s surgery is often dependent on how long it has had colic, the age and condition of the horse, as well as the location of the problem within its digestive tract., Your vet will likely give you instructions for how to care for your horse after treatment. These can be as simple as monitoring the horse for further pain or taking preventative measure to control colic.Make sure to closely follow any instructions your vet gives you so that your horse stays healthy. Your vet may suggest some of the following post-treatment instructions:


Giving the horse plenty of fresh, clean water
Ensuring that the horse has plenty of roughage, like pasture or hay, in its diet
Getting regular dental checkups to ensure the horse can properly chew its food
Avoiding grazing full time in the spring

, There are four general causes of colic in horses: stretched intestines because of gas or fluid; tension on the mesentery, or fold that attaches the intestinal organs to the abdomen; inadequate blood supply because of twisting of the intestine; inflammation develops along the intestinal wall (or enteritis) or covering of the intestines (or peritonitis).Recognizing the risk factors that can contribute to these causes may help you more readily identify colic in your horse. The following may make your horse more prone to colic:


Earlier bouts of colic
Diseases such as flatulent colic, intestinal obstruction, and ulcers
Worms or other parasites
Infrequent teeth floating
Changes to the feed and water supply
Changes in exercise and stabling, There is an increased risk of colic in horses if they don’t get fresh water every 1-2 hours. This is especially true for horses over the age of six. Make sure your horse has a source of fresh and clean water every 1-2 hours to minimize the risk of colic.Consider letting your horse drink out of a bucket instead of an automatic waterer. A bucket will allow your horse to ingest a larger amount of water at one time than a waterer will.
Think about environmental considerations. Make sure that any water sources are free flowing and not clogged with ice in the winter. In addition, consider adding hot water to buckets in the winter or giving your horses a continuous supply of warm water. Refresh water often in the summer.
Stop to let your horse drink every couple of hours if you are traveling.

, How you feed your horse can have a big impact on its overall health, including its risk for colic. Optimizing its feeding by giving it access to pasture and avoiding sand can help prevent colic.Make sure your horse has access to a pasture if possible. Not feeding on round bales of hay can minimize your horse’s risk of colic. In addition, avoid giving your horse pelleted feed or corn feed if possible in favor of fresh hay or grass.
Avoid feeding your horse on the ground if it is sandy. Horses that ingest a lot of sand are more likely to get colic. Provide feed in tubs or hay racks or place rubber mats or catch pans on the ground to allow your horse to eat scraps without ingesting sand.
Change your horse’s diet only gradually if necessary. Mix ¼ of the new feed with ¾ of the old for 7 days and then gradually increase the new percent of the feed until your horse is used to it.

, It’s important for your horse’s teeth to be healthy so that it can properly chew its food. This can minimize the risk for colic. Use a float, which is a type of file or rasp, to maintain your horse’s oral hygiene every six months.Purchase a float at a pet store or specialty horse or farm store. There are different types of manual and electric floats you can use to file or rasp your horse’s teeth.
Float the horse’s teeth so that the surfaces are straight, which provides optimal chewing. Don’t worry about hurting your horse; its teeth don’t have any nerves near the surface.If you are concerned about floating your horse’s teeth, consider having your vet do the procedure.

, Because your horse is outside daily, it is exposed to different parasites such as worms. Give your horse a daily wormer or have your horse regularly dewormed by your vet. Both of these measures can reduce the risk of colic in your horse.Consider deworming your horse quarterly, which is what most farms do, with a double dose of pyrantel or a product containing praziquantel. You can back up these medication by using ivermectin for the other three dewormings. Ask your vet what the best deworming treatment for your horse."
"
Consider the following vitamins that your horse may need.,
Administer the supplements.",How to Feed Your Horse Vitamins Properly," Many of these vitamins (like those in human diets) are provided in their everyday foods, i.e. the standard feed/hay that your horse is receiving. What sort of supplements your horse needs is determined by its age, activity level, whether you want to breed him/her, your horse's condition, feed given (pellet, 10/10, oats, first/second cutting hay), etc. Your veterinarian will help you select what to add to your horse's feed (be it squirts of vegetable oil, ground orange peel, glucosamine, bute...)


Vitamin A (found in Carrots, Colostrum Milk, Fresh Grass and Herbage)
Vitamin B1 (Alfalfa)
Vitamin B12 (Cod Liver Oil, Soybean Oil and Fresh Grass and Herbage)
Vitamin B3 (Peas and Beans)
Vitamin C (Carrots, Apples, Fresh Grass and Herbage)
Vitamin D (Colostrum Milk, Fresh Herbage, and Sunlight)
Vitamin E (Alfalfa, Cereal Germ, and Fresh Herbage)
Vitamin K (Alfalfa, Fresh Grass and Herbage)
Biotin (Fresh Grass and Herbage, Maize, Rose Hips, Yeast)
Calcium (Alfalfa,Limestone Flour, Seaweed, Sugar Beet)
Phosphorus (Bran, Dandelions Oats, Barley, and Maize)
Protein (Alfalfa, Cereals, Fresh Grass and Herbage, and Linseed)
Manganese and Zinc (Alfalfa, Bran, Cereals, Fresh Grass and Herbage, and Yeast);
,


If your horse is in a stall during feeding, this is relatively easy. If your horse isn't picky, you can just take his feed bucket, add pellets (or whatever he gets) and sprinkle the vitamins on top (give a spritz of oil, whatever,) then give him the bucket. If your horse is slightly pickier, you can add about half of his feed, sprinkle the vitamins on top of that, then cover with the other half. Generally, by the time he gets down to the vitamin bits, he's already too in the swing of things to stop because of the vitamins.
If your horse is being rough boarded (i.e. he's in a pasture, most often with a few other horses), you might have a bit more trouble. It is difficult (to put it mildly) to feed only one horse in a pasture if they're all hungry, unless your horse is the dominant one. See about what the regular feeding time is for the other horses in that pasture, and feed him then.

Let's assume then that all of the horses in a given pasture are being fed at once, and one (or more) of them need a specific set of vitamins. Buckets should be set on fences at about six to twelve feet apart, minimum, and when feeding, you should go down the line, from the bucket closest to the feed stores to the bucket furthest away.
Generally, it's best to have in a large carry bucket enough of the feed you're using to feed all of the horses in a given pasture at the start of feeding time. Which ever horse is waiting at the first bucket, put about half of the food he'd normally eat at meals in the bucket. Move on to the next, put half in, and so on, watching the line of horses behind you as they settle in. Sometimes they'll vie for buckets, claim someone else's, etc.
After a minute or so, each horse will start to settle on its bucket. Head back to the first horse in the line's bucket, and fill your scoop with the remaining half of his food, and on top of that, sprinkle his particular vitamins for the day. Dump in bucket, move to next. Be aware, this has to be done relatively quickly, as horses tend to finish their feed fast. Sometimes, the first horse in the line (generally, the largest/most dominant in that pasture) will finish the first half of his food before I get back to him, and will jockey another horse off of his bucket. To avoid this, sometimes a zig-zag feeding approach helps - feed the first horse, then the next, notice that the first has really settled on his bucket, go back and add the second half and vitamins, go feed the third, notice the second is settled, etc.
After a while, you'll start to know the horses' pecking order, and this will get easier, because if you know that Horse A will always win a bucket vying contest, you can just give him his full feed at once. In these cases, you should probably still (in the scoop) put 1/2 feed in, sprinkling vitamins, then put the other 1/2 feed in - so that the vitamins don't end up at the bottom of his bucket, uneaten, after you've dumped the scoop in there.

This will give you time to take care of the logistics of euthanasia, such as coordinating the removal and disposal of your horse’s body. This will also give you time to discuss your decision with your family members, friends, and stable manager., If you have a mortality insurance policy on your horse, carefully review your policy before euthanizing your horse. There may be provisions in that policy specifying the insurance company’s process of authorizing euthanasia. On top of the already emotionally difficult decision to euthanize, you do not want to create more stress for yourself if your decision to euthanize goes against the insurance policy., If the euthanasia is not an emergency situation, take time beforehand to coordinate your horse’s removal, and, if permitted by law, burial. Contact a disposal service that will remove your horse’s body for you.Other than burial, you have the option of having your horse cremated or rendered. Contact companies that provide these professional services if you prefer non-burial options., There are a number of medical reasons for which euthanasia would be appropriate. Your veterinarian can help you identify if your horse has these conditions.Severe traumatic injury
Chronic severe lameness
Inoperable colic

, Deciding whether to euthanize your horse is a difficult one. If you have the time to decide, consider going over some questions with your veterinarian. You want to be sure that you are making the right decision for you and your horse.Is my horse suffering?
Can I continue to take on the financial burden of caring for my horse?
Are there any alternatives to euthanasia for my horse?
How will long will my horse suffer in his current state?

, There are several acceptable methods of euthanasia that are acceptable for horses, including barbiturates and penetrative captive bolt.Your veterinarian is licensed to use these methods and will be able to explain these methods to you. With this knowledge, you can make a more informed decision on what method of euthanasia would be most suitable for your horse, given his current medical condition.


Barbiturates are drugs that depress the nervous system. Given as an overdose via intravenous injection, barbiturates will first cause unconsciousness, then depression of breathing, and finally cardiac arrest. The most commonly used barbiturate for equine euthanasia is called sodium pentobarbital. Only your veterinarian can administer barbiturates.The use of a penetrative captive bolt is another acceptable option that your veterinarian can perform. A penetrative captive bolt causes a concussion and major brain damage, resulting in immediate unconsciousness. This method is more commonly used in cattle for slaughtering purposes.
Your veterinarian can also use potassium chloride (KCl) via intravenous injection while your horse is under anesthesia.An overdose of KCl causes cardiac arrest and eventual death.
There are also euthanasia methods (eg, gunshot, electrocution) that are classified as ‘conditionally acceptable’ because they may not consistently lead to a humane death or have not undergone extensive scientific testing. They also pose a high risk for human error or injury., It is very important to remember that the decision to euthanize rests with you. Although there may be emergency situations where the veterinarian has to make the professional decision to euthanize without owner’s consent, this is very rare.


Realize that asking your veterinarian what they would do can put them in an uncomfortable position, since they are not your horse’s owner and do not have the same emotional and financial attachment to your horse that you do.Also keep in mind that your veterinarian may refuse to support your decision to euthanize, if they feel like your horse’s medical condition does not warrant euthanasia.Consider seeking a second option from another veterinarian if you are still undecided after speaking with your veterinarian., Gunshot is commonly the only practical method of euthanasia when veterinary assistance is not available. Either a pistol or rifle will be suitable for euthanizing your horse via gunshot. The advantage of using a pistol is that you can hold the pistol in one hand and hold your horse’s lead rope in the other hand; this is useful if your horse is standing and there is no one to help you hold the horse.


If you only have access to a rifle, then someone else will need to hold the horse because you will have to use both hands to hold the rifle.
There are several types of shotguns that you can use. Either the 12, 16, or 20 gauge shotguns loaded with slugs (heavy lead or copper-coated projectile) are appropriate for use on a horse.

, The most commonly used bullets are either .22 caliber or .38 caliber. In younger horses, whose skulls are not as thick, the .22 caliber would likely be sufficient to penetrate the skull. In older and larger horses with thicker skulls, it is recommended to use the larger .38 caliber to ensure that the bullet penetrates the skull.


Use a soft-nosed bullet that is hard-cast of lead, rather than a bullet that is encased in a full metal jacket. This reduces the chance that the shooter or a bystander will get injured when the gun is fired.
Remember that the goal of selecting the proper firearm and ammunition is to ensure that the bullet is large enough to penetrate the skull with enough velocity and energy to cause massive brain destruction and immediate death.
Load the gun so that it will be ready for euthanasia.# Choose a location for the euthanasia. Choose an area that can be easily reached by equipment to remove the horse for burial, cremation, or rendering. Following euthanasia, your horse’s body will enter a state of rigor mortis in about two hours;once rigor mortis sets in, it will be extremely difficult to move your horse if he is in a stall or other small area.
If your horse is in a smaller area and cannot be moved (down and unable to move, violently thrashing and not safe to approach), you will need to perform the euthanasia as safely as possible without moving the animal.

, You will be standing in front of your horse to shoot the gun, so your horse would see what you’re about to do if he’s not blindfolded; this could cause him to become anxious and restless, making euthanasia more difficult to carry out. By blindfolding him, he will not be able to see what you are about to do and you will not have to look him in the eye.


Do not attempt to blindfold your horse if he is thrashing and unsafe to approach.

, Whether you are using a shotgun or rifle, you will need to stand in front of the horse, but slightly off to the side (if your horse is standing). If you are using a shotgun, hold the shotgun in one hand and the lead rope in the other. If you are using a rifle, use both of your hands to hold the rifle and have the other person holding the lead rope to stand behind you; they should stand behind you for their protection.


Stand two to three feet away from your horse.
Your horse may fall directly forward following the gunshot (rather than to the side), which would be very dangerous for you and whoever is assisting you if you are standing directly in front of the horse. Standing off to the side will protect you if your horse falls forward.
If possible, stand uphill from your horse. If he falls forward, the force of gravity will not push his body forward towards you.
If there is anybody else witnessing the euthanasia, make sure that they are standing behind you for their protection.

, To ensure that the bullet enters the skull at the proper location, draw two imaginary lines. Draw one line from the right ear to the left eye, and the other line from left ear to the right eye. The intersection of these two lines should be exactly in the middle of your horse’s forehead and at the bony ridge of the skull.Aim your gun slightly off center from where the lines intersect to avoid the bony ridge.Do not place the muzzle of the gun directly on your horse! This could cause serious injury to you, since the gunpowder and gas could get confined in the gun and result in an explosion in your hand. Also, the bullet will enter the skull with more velocity if you keep the gun two to three feet away from the bullet entry point.
Getting the correct aim will be easier to do if the animal is standing and still. If the animal is lying down in an awkward position, aim down the neck.
If your horse is thrashing, try to aim for the head, neck, or lower chest near the elbow.

, Provided that your aim is correct, your horse should go down and his death should be immediate.Be aware, though, that your horse may violently convulse even if the bullet entered the skull at the correct location.If this happens, make sure that everyone continues to stand as far as back from the horse for safety reasons.


If you needed to initially aim for another part of the body because your horse was either in an awkward position or too mobile, you can wait until your animal is more still after the initial shot and then aim for the midpoint of the forehead.

, There are multiple ways to check that your horse has died. One way is to listen for a heartbeat. Another way is to check your horse’s eyes. The eyes of a horse are very sensitive, so if the eyes react even to the slightest touch, your horse has not yet died.To check the eyes, touch the cornea (clear covering over the eyes). If the horse blinks, your horse is still alive. Wait several minutes and try again. Once the eye no longer responds to your touch, you will know that your horse has died.

, It is ideal to have your horse moved before rigor mortis has set in. Once rigor mortis sets in, your horse’s body will become stuck in the position in which he died, which could make it very difficult to move him."

Understand the importance of preventing tetanus in your horse.,
Immunize your horse regularly.,
Recognize the signs of tetanus in your horse.,
Get immediate vet attention for a horse that has not been vaccinated or whose vaccinations are not up to date (i.e., has not received yearly booster shots).",How to Prevent Tetanus in Horses," Horses are very vulnerable when infected by the bacteria that causes tetanus, Clostridium tetani.The bacteria can enter through what might seem like a harmless cut or scrape to your eyes, but is an easy entry point for the bacteria and it may well be too late to do anything by the time you realize that your horse is suffering from tetanus.;
, Every domestic horse should be immunized against tetanus.


Vaccinate pregnant mares about 4–6 weeks prior to birth with tetanus toxoid. This will pass the immunity on to the foals via the colostrum. Doing so will protect foals for the first 2–3 months of their life.The initial vaccination for foals from a vaccinated mare should be given in a course of 3 vaccinations: the first vaccination for tetanus at 6 months of age, followed by booster vaccinations at 7 and 8 to 9 months of age.The initial vaccination for foals from non-vaccinated mares should be at 3–4 months, then a second at 4–5 months, then a third at 5–6 months.For a horse that has never received a tetanus vaccination, this should commence immediately. This should be 2 doses about 3–6 weeks apart.Ensure that each horse receives an annual booster.Do not neglect it, as the immunity runs out after this period of time.

Stiff gait, head thrown forward, nostrils distended and muzzle has a square appearanceLocalized stiffness around jaw, neck and hind limb muscles, as well as around area of the woundBody becomes stiffer and stiffer until it appears like a board, or has a ""sawhorse"" postureLegs are held out wider than usual and hind legs may be turned outTail held out stifflyHorse becomes easily excited by noise or movement, resulting in violent spasmsDifficulty grasping or chewing food (lockjaw)Ears erect, nostrils dilated, third eyelid sunkenHorse may fall and not be able to get up again., The vet will need to administer tetanus anti-toxin.Do not wait for symptoms; as soon as you note a cut or wound, get the vet.

Use bran as a bulk food.,
Consider using flaked corn to be a feed with value.,

Use oats sparingly.,
Try beet pulp now and then.,
Feed beet cubes with care.,
*Soak the sugar beet for at least 12 hours if freezing water before feeding this to a horse.",How to Get the Right Concentrated Feed for Your Horse," Do not use it as a source of nutrition. It is not good for growing horses as it has too much phosphorus and doesn't have enough calcium to provide a nutritious equine diet.;
, The corn is often processed even further by the food companies to make it non-heating. Non-heating means that the nutritional concentration is lowered a little bit so that the horse gets a little less energy from it.

, Be aware that there are lots of different pellets to suit different horse's needs, so you should make sure to buy the one that meets your horse's needs (e.g., pregnancy, lactating, over-wintering, etc.). Read the labels or ask for advice form your vet or the retailer.

, Take a good look at coarse mix; it looks much like Raisin Bran cereal, which makes it look a lot more appetizing! But a more valid reason to feed coarse mix to horses than pellets is because it takes longer time to eat. This makes it better for the horse's digestive system. Note that this food comes in various grades; read the labels or ask for advice when purchasing.

, Uncooked linseed is poisonous to horses of all ages. Linseed must be boiled at a high temperature until the seeds split. The up-side to this laborious feed is that it has laxative effects, which helps produce a glossy coat.

, Note that barley is often underrated, but it has a high energy content. However, you should take care when feeding it to the horse because even a small change in the amount fed can result in significant nutritional consequences.

, Even when it is dried up, alfalfa still contains wonderful concentrations of minerals and vitamins that are found in grass. It has a particular value for its fiber and calcium content. It is often called ""pelleted sunshine"".

, Oats are mostly popular due to the fact that careless changes to the amount fed make a very little difference in nutritional value due to the fact that oats have a very low energy content. Unfortunately, oats are not a natural food for horses, so don't feed them solely on oats or they will become deficient in much needed nutrients.

, This is a valuable feed due to its richness in protein and energy. Beet pulp is dried beet and must be soaked in fresh water before feeding, or you may risk poisoning the horse.

, Just like the beet pulp, beet cubes expand very rapidly when they touch water, or saliva for that matter and also need to be soaked in water before feeding, so as not to promote poisoning or choking. Colic is also a risk that may occur if beet cubes are not soaked in fresh water before feeding. Never confuse beet cubes with ordinary cubes.

, There should still be some water left in the feed that has not been soaked up in order for this feed to be desirable.

Give your horse a high fiber diet.,
Don't allow your horse to eat rich diet.,
Keep your horse from becoming overweight.,
Don't allow your horse to get too thin.,
Always feed your horse fresh food.,
Add digestive supplements to their diet.,
Make sure your horse's diet isn't being interfered with.,
Use feed pans for feeding.",How to Prevent a Horse From Colicking1," Intestinal blockages from poor diet can cause your horse to colic. Make sure your horse is getting plenty of fiber by giving them at least 60% of their daily nutrition in hay, and keeping pasture grazing to a minimum.Hay and grass should be the basis of your horse's diet, with grain in the least amounts.
Do not give your horse non-soaked sugar beet.;
, Too much alfalfa or too much grain, and your horse will colic. Introduce new diets gradually, over the course of 2 weeks. If you put your horse on pasture that's 50% alfalfa, it's going to get colicky. If your horse is gradually introduced to a field, and still colic, that's a sign that his/her diet is still too rich, and that that horse will never become adjusted to that diet.

, If you notice your horse is beginning to get fat, begin increasing their physical activity and adjusting their diet to lose weight.

, Similar to being overweight, a horse that is too thin is in poor physical condition and will be more susceptible to physical ailments. Build muscle mass by increasing exercise over time, and improve their overall diet in order to put on healthy weight.

, Moldy hay, insects, and bits of plastic or twine put your horse at risk, if caught in their hay or other feed. Don't let their food sit around for too long, and if you do always check for the aforementioned items. Scoop paddocks of old hay after a few days or a heavy rain to reduce the risk of mold and insect growth.

, Just like humans, regular supplements that add vitamins and nutrients to the horse's diet are beneficial in minimizing health risks. Look for supplements which increase levels of healthy bacteria (like probiotics).


Look at supplement websites, such a SmartPak.  They guarantee that your horse won't colic, and if your horse does colic while on the supplement, they will pay for your horse to have colic surgery!
Probiotics are inexpensive and support a healthy digestive tract.  You can find them online or at your local feed store.
Ulcer supplements can help prevent ulcers in your horse which can cause colic.
Adding some vegetable oil or coconut oil to your horses feed has been said to help prevent blockages in your horses gut.
If your horse won't take powder supplements, most come in pelleted forms.

, Put a notice up on the horse's stall door telling guests not to feed your horse, if it is kept at a place where visitors can come and may feed them treats. Being fed too frequently and with unhealthy foods can make a horse more likely to colic.

, It is important for the horse to eat in the natural head-down position, but without consuming other harmful things in the process. Feed pans can be used to allow your horse to eat as naturally as possible, while minimizing the likelihood of the consumption of sand, manure, and shavings."

Keep a constant supply of fresh water available.,
Keep up worming and parasite control.,
Keep your horse's living quarters clean.,
Schedule regular dental exams.,
Adjust your feeding schedule.,
Increase the amount of daily exercise.",How to Prevent a Horse From Colicking2," One study showed that horses without access to fresh water for longer than two hours were at a significantly higher risk of colicking. Keep water available, and use filtering systems in troughs to prevent insect growth.


Make sure water is not too cold in the winter, as very cold water can cause colic.

, Keep up regular medication to prevent worm and parasite growth in your horse's intestinal system. Anything that might cause a blockage of the intestine - such as certain worms and parasites - can cause colic.


Your horse should be wormed twice every season.  Yes, Winter too! Worms can cause unrepairable damage to your horses intestines.
You can buy horse wormers over the counter at your local feed store.  Make sure you read the instructions on the back, though overdosing a horse with wormer is hard to do.
If your horse will refuse to take a gel dewormer, they have pellets you can add to your horses grain, though this method is a little more expensive.

, Manure piles and old hay are highly likely to grow mold, bacteria, worms, insects, and other parasites that are harmful to your horse. Make sure to pick your horse's living area of manure regularly, and remove any old or wet hay. Replace shavings in their stalls on a regular basis to prevent bacteria growth from urine buildup.

, When your horse's teeth get out of shape and worn down, your horse has a much harder time fully chewing (and therefore digesting) their food. Make sure your horse's teeth get examined every six months or so, and floated when necessary.


Some horses need their teeth floated by a vet every six months. Some horses need their teeth floated once a year or less. If your horse is losing a lot of feed when eating, or holds their head in a odd position, it may be time to have their teeth checked out.

, Horse's should be fed several smaller meals over the course of the day, rather than one large grain-rich meal. Move their feeding schedule around a bit so that eating is broken up over several hours, and occurs after (rather than before) heavy exercise.

, Horses that are stalled for eight hours a day or aren't able to have a large space to run around in are at a much higher risk of colicking. Ride or lunge your horse on a daily basis if they can't run around, and put them out in a paddock when you're able to.

Provide alternative forage during down times for grass, if necessary.,
Provide treats and supplements that add nutritional diversity.",How to Grass Feed a Horse," Before getting started on grazing your horses, you need to do a couple things to prepare, like choosing pastures and fencing your pastures. Multiple fenced pastures are often necessary because of the lifecycle of the grasses in your pastures and the demands your horses will put on the pasture ecosystem. Consider:


Having at least two (or many more) pastures, a spring/summer pasture and a fall/winter pasture.
Making sure your pastures have proper drainage and don’t have large holes or other dangers that could harm your horses.
Walking your fence line a couple times a year to make sure the fence is maintained and will keep your horses in.
Creating shelters like a “lean to” so your horses will have cover from the elements.;
, In order to make sure your pasture is producing enough grass of the right type for your horses to graze on, you’ll have to test your soil. Testing your soil will help you figure out whether and what type of fertilizer you need. After you know the pH and general composition of your soil, you’ll have a better idea of where to go from there.


Contact your local agricultural extension service for help on testing. Agricultural extension services are often funded by the Federal government and associated with public universities in the United States. They provide resources to the community to promote sound agricultural practices.
Test in 10 acre sections.
Make sure to test again every couple of years., The pH of your soil is one of the most important things that contributes to healthy grass growth and decomposition of waste material. As a result, you’ll want to establish a healthy pH when establishing your pasture, and manage it in the following years.


Acidic soil will undermine your fertilizer.
Generally, a pH of 6 to 7 is very good for most types of grasses.
If you need to raise your pH, add lime. Lime will raise your pH for a few years. Contact your extension agent for specifics., If you’ve tested your soil, and you understand its pH level and composition, you’ll be more equipped to fertilize your soil in order to produce the type(s) of grass that is best for your climate and geology. Perhaps one of the most important things to consider is whether you want to use organic or inorganic fertilizer.


Inorganic fertilizer is fertilizer that has probably been processed to promote plant growth. It makes nutrients available faster, has a specific nutrient composition formulated for grass growth, and is more concentrated than organic.
Organic fertilizer is derived from natural sources and is often unprocessed. It releases nutrients slower than inorganic, and it is hard to determine the exact concentration and amount of nutrients in it. You’ll also probably need more of it. Organic fertilizer, like manure, is often cheaper than inorganic fertilizer.
The type of fertilizer you use might depend on your climate, geology, and other factors. Contact your local extension agent for more information., After you’ve tested and fertilized your soil, you’ll need to determine if you want to plant a specific type of grass in your pasture. The type of grass you pick will be dependent on a number of factors, so consider:


Your soil acidity.
Your climate.
Drainage and amount of water.
The number of animals grazing in the pasture.
The season. Different grasses grow better in different seasons. Depending on your location, you might be dependent on several grasses., Constant grazing in a pasture is very demanding on the grasses and the soils. As a result, you don’t want to overgraze a pasture. You could undermine the ability of that pasture to produce the grass you need. Always make sure you have enough space for all of your animals. This typically means that you should have at least one acre of pasture per horse., The first step in making sure your horse is eating enough grass is to let him graze as often as possible. Horses spend about 70% of their time in a pasture grazing, so the more time spent in a pasture, the more grazing your horse will be able to do., The method of introducing your horses to a new pasture depends on your specific circumstances. Generally, if your horses have been in a pasture all winter, then you can just move them into the new spring pasture without any issues. If your horses have been stalled or have not been eating wild grass during the winter, you need to slowly introduce them to the pasture.


Start with about an hour of grazing time the first day.
Increase grazing time over the next 10 days.
Monitor your horses, as horses that have been stalled or have not been eating pasture grass during the winter could have an adverse reaction if they are suddenly introduced to an endless supply of pasture grass., Many extension services note that the regrowth or recovery time for grasses ranges from 10 to 60 days. This depends on a lot of factors, such as season, temperature, water levels, and the soil. Because of this, the more pastures you have, the better and healthier your grass will be.


Wait until your grass is 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) high before reintroducing animals.
Rest your pasture when the grass is down to 3 or 4 inches.
If possible, consider dividing up your pastures so that you can move your horses to a new pasture every week or two.
If you don’t have enough land, divide your pasture up as much as possible to make sure your grasses have an adequate amount of time to regenerate before you reintroduce your horses.
Regrowth time depends on location, grass, and soil quality, so contact your local extension office for more information., Fresh, lush grass lacks adequate fiber and can cause diarrhea in horses from gut imbalances. The higher sugar levels in new grass can also lead to behavioral problems or laminitis.


At times such times where there is rapid new grass growth, consider limiting your horses grazing to an hour a day. Wait until the grass has matured a little and you have phased your horses into a new pasture before unleashing them permanently.
Such imbalances due to flushes of new grass are typical during the spring.
Make sure your horses are getting plenty of fiber, in the form of baled hale, to counteract any potential problems., Some experts recommend letting other animals graze with your horses. Sheep and goats, especially, will eat weeds and other plants that your horses won’t. This typically increases the ability of your pasture to produce higher quality grasses since they will no longer be competing with weeds for nutrients and space., Watching the quality of your grass and your pastures is an ongoing job. It is never a good idea to assume that the grass your horse has access to is supplying all your horse's needs. You should walk your pasture every week to see how the grass is and to figure out if you need to move your horses to another pasture or provide them with extra forage or protein supplements., In pastures where the grass quality is relatively poor, your horse might be consuming an insufficient amount of protein. Protein is extremely important for growth and muscle repair. It is even more important for working horses. If your pasture has poor quality grass, consider protein supplements for your horse.


Canola meal.
Soybean meal.
Other bean meals.
Growing horses need 12% to 18% protein in their diet.
Mature horses need 8% to 12% protein in their diet., In some regions, grass will cease to grow or decline in quality during certain times of the year. As a result, you’ll need to provide alternative forage, such as bales of alfalfa mixed with other grasses. There are a number of times you should consider added bales of forage to your pastures for your horses.


During winter months where grasses don’t grow or decline in quality.
In summer months in regions where excessive rainfall makes fields unsuitable for grass growth.
In times of excessive heat or drought when grass quality will decline.
Spread out your forage at various locations throughout the pasture., Even though your horses will primarily depend on grass for their food, you should offer them treats and other supplements. Treats will make your horses happy and help you form a bond with them. Supplements will make sure that their nutritional needs are completely met. Consider:


Carrots. Horses love this traditional treat.
Apples. Apples are another popular treat that horses enjoy.
A variety of supplements. Contact your vet for suggestions about what supplements your horses might need based on your climate and the type of grass in your pastures."

Traditionally, food was pumped into youngsters in an effort to get them to mature quicker. However, this is proven to have a negative effect on the confirmation of a young horse.
A gradual increase in feed as the horse grows is more beneficial. Once weaned, a horse relies totally on your feeding to obtain the right nutrients.;
, Grass is best and when this is not available, good quality hay or haylage (NOT silage) is essential. You may like a coarse mix (9-11%), since it is pretty palatable. Only try feeding this if the horse can be turned out, as it is usually high in molasses and may cause azoturia if the horse is locked up. Generally, feed this when grazing is poor during the colder months or when condition starts to drop. Try to up the levels of hay first, as this is usually cheaper and just as effective.

Take into consideration the lifestyle of your horse.",How to Put Weight on a Horse4," Is he pulling a two week cart, or in a team pulling the Budweiser wagon? What you feed here depends on what it is you and your horse do.


If your horse is working hard 4-6 days a week, devise a feed chart.
Racehorses need high protein feeds which are less fattening. Reducing hay and increasing the hard feed is the norm, Race mix is the norm and is pre made but tends to be expensive. Traditional feeds such as beet pulp and oats are still common in the racing yard.
For the pleasure horse, feed simple coarse mix or beet pulp and barley. Increased amounts of feed is given after the horse has worked hard. Hard feed is cut out completely for the ponies in Spring as they tend to only look at grass and get fat.

Realize the importance of getting medical attention.,

Monitor your horse's progress.",How to Treat Horse Eye Problems," The vet will look at the eye and socket for any kind of foreign bodies (such as a foxtail). The vet may also apply a special dye called fluorescein which reveals any damage to the surface of the eye. To see the eye in greater detail, the vet will use an ophthalmoscope which has a series of lens to magnify both the surface and the deeper chamber of the eye.To perform a thorough eye exam, the vet may need to dilate your horse's eyes.;
, Once your vet has diagnosed your horse, a medication (like an antibiotic) will probably be prescribed. This will probably be an in the form of drops or ointment. Drops may be helpful for several days because they can relieve pain, but your horse will need to be in a shaded area or have a fly mask since drops can dilate the pupils.Understand how to correctly apply these medications to your horse's eye:


Apply an ointment 2 to 6 times a day, as recommended by the vet. Run the ointment over the top of the eyelid to make sure it cleans the whole eye.
Apply eye drops (like atropine) by pulling up on the skin above the eye to widen the opening. Prepare the ointment by squeezing a small amount to the end of the tube. Approach the horse's eye from behind so that he doesn't see it coming towards him. Use a finger and thumb on one hand to open the eyelid and spot the drop against the inside of the lower lid. You can also drop it onto the surface of the cornea. Let the horse close his eye, which will naturally spread the ointment over the surface.

, If the vet diagnoses your horse with a corneal ulceration, the vet will probably numb the surface of the eye using local anesthetic drops. The vet will carefully rub the surface with a sterile cotton swab to remove any dead tissue that's stuck to the eye. Removing the tissue will speed up healing. The eye will be rinsed with sterile saline and the vet will probably prescribe antibiotic eye drops. You'll need to apply them 2 to 6 times a day (depending on the medication) for around 7 to 10 days.


A corneal ulceration is often caused by grit or a branch rubbing against the surface of the eye. This creates a divot on the surface of the eye that the vet can see during the examination. If not treated, corneal ulcerations may wear down into the eye., The vet may diagnose your horse with ERU or ""Moon Blindness"" which causes the pupil to spasm and contract. While there's no cure for ERU, treatment will focus on handling the symptoms.The vet may prescribe antibiotic drops to put in once or twice a day to dilate the pupil and stop the painful spasms. You'll probably want to keep your horse in a shaded area and avoid riding him while the pupil is dilated, since this can interfere with his vision. Steroid drops may also be prescribed to reduce inflammation. Pain medication may also be prescribed.


ERU is an inflammation in the uvea within the eye, which is made up of the iris, the fibers that hold the lens in place (ciliary body), and the lining of the eye. It's a painful condition which prevents the eye from functioning properly. This keeps the horse from focusing and can make it difficult for him to see., The vet will treat this bacterial infection by keeping the eye clean. Disposable cotton pads are soaked in saline and wiped over the eye. The vet will prescribe an antibiotic ointment to be applied once or twice a day for 7 to 10 days.Conjunctivitis is a bacterial infection of the surface parts of the eye. This can be hot, itchy, and painful for the horse, creating a lot of discharge from the eye. This discharge can gum the eyes shut, making it more attractive for flies to lay their eggs there. To prevent fly infestation, it's important to keep the eyes clean., Both eyes should appear symmetrical when you look at the horse head on. Both eyelids should open to the same extent, the whites of the eye should be white, the pupils (dark central part within the eye) should both be the same size, and the eyes should be clean, clear and bright. Look for the following, which may indicate problems with the eyes:Swelling of just one eye or eyelid
A red eye or eye with angry blood vessels in what should be the white part of the eye
One pupil that's larger than the other
Jumps or lines in the surface of eye, which could indicate a scratch or ulcer
Yellow or green discharge (Occasionally, when it's very dusty the eye may wash dust out of the eye in which case you will see a clear goopy discharge in the inner corner of the eye. This can be normal.)
Squinting or avoiding sunlight
An eye that looks red, cloudy or sunken
An eye that the horse keeps closed
An excessive amount of tear fluid, such that the eye is constantly watering
The whites of the eyes are puffy and swollen
The surface of the eye doesn't look clear and shiny but is dull or glazed with white

, If you notice anything unusual about your horse's eyes, call the vet. There are many potential causes of eye problems in horses, from allergy, trauma, and debris, as well as other diseases. These need to be professionally diagnosed and the correct treatment started, in order to preserve the horse's eyesight. Neglecting to act or ignoring the horse has a problem could endanger the horse's sight.Be aware that some conditions may require lifelong treatment, like Equine Recurrent Uveitis. The sooner you start caring for your horse's eye conditions, the better chances he has of recovering or living comfortably., Before the veterinarian arrives to examine your horse, take a moist, clean cloth to remove any discharge from around the eye. You should also shield the horse from direct sun.Put blinders or a fly mask on your horse to help protect the horse from direct sunlight. Alternately, you can move the horse inside. All of these things can make your horse more comfortable and reduce strain on troubled eyes.


Some conditions such as recurrent equine uveitis are aggravated by sunlight and UV, so keeping the eyes protected is important.

, If the eye seems to worsen or doesn't improve within several days, it's best to have your vet come back out for an exam. Ulcers can sometimes increase in size, and even threaten the inner part of the eye if not treated aggressively from the beginning of treatment.


Don't use ointments or medications without your veterinarian's approval. When it comes to treating your horse's eyes, the vet is the most knowledgeable person to quickly care for your horse.

Keep horses out of arenas or paddocks where the infested horse has been.,
Do a second lice treatment.",How to Treat Horse Lice," Place the bucket near the horse, but avoid putting it near the hind legs, where the horse is likely to kick it over.;
, Mix a veterinarian-recommended lice-treatment shampoo, such as pyrethrin, with the water in the bucket. Pour the water and shampoo into a large spray bottle.


Make sure the lice shampoo is formulated specifically for horses. Lice treatments for cattle or sheep may cause skin irritation and hair loss.

, Spray the pyrethrin mixture all over the horse's body, being careful to avoid the eyes, ears, and nose.

Although lice are found primarily in horses' manes, tails, fetlocks and along their backs, the lice may also be hiding anywhere within the coat.






Therefore, it is important to treat the horse's entire body, even if it's just a light infestation.







, Thoroughly wash off the horse to remove the pyrethrin mixture, using a sponge or rags soaked in clean water. If the weather is cool, use warm water. If the weather is warm, the horse can be washed off with a garden hose.

, Also be sure to use a brush or comb to untangle the hair on the horse's mane, tail, forelocks and fetlocks to remove any lice or nits (lice eggs) that may be caught in them.

, Sprinkle a light coating of non-toxic Sevin dust on the floor of the horse's stable. This will kill off any remaining lice, thus preventing them from finding a new host.

, Use the pyrethrin mixture to thoroughly wash all of the horse's grooming tools, making sure to rinse them well afterwards. This will prevent the horse from being re-infested during grooming.

, Wash any blankets or rugs that have been used by the horse or that are located in any areas the horse has come in contact with.

, Rub down the infested horse's saddle and harness using a leather cleaner or other appropriate cleaning product.

, Lice may still be present on trees or rails that the infested horse rubbed up against while scratching.


Luckily, equine lice can only survive without a host for several days at most, so the paddock can be used again within about 10 days.

, Since lice treatments do not destroy the eggs, a follow-up treatment is usually recommended about two weeks after the initial treatment, in order to kill any lice that may have hatched in the interim.

Add a bit of crushed or milled flaxseed to your horse’s food.You should discuss this with your veterinarian or herbalist before beginning supplementation.
You will want to provide 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of flaxseed per every 1,000 lbs. (454 kg) of your animal’s weight, per day.;
, Neem oil is an essential oil extracted from the neem tree. It has a solid consistency (when cold) and a strong smell. It acts as an excellent natural insecticide. Warm the neem oil in your palms and apply to your horse’s neck. Leave this on for at least one hour, and shampoo off.You can double your efforts by using a natural insecticide shampoo.

, Sweet foods—molasses, sugary feeds, some spring grasses, and sweet treats—have been shown to exacerbate the conditions of sweet itch. (Some believe this is where the name Sweet Itch is derived). These foods should be strictly avoided in your horse’s diet., In order for your horse’s lesions to heal, you must attempt to quell the itch. Apply aloe, lavender oil, or wild germanium oil directly to your horse’s skin, or dilute essential oils in a carrier oil (such as coconut oil).Avoid applying essential oil to broken skin.

, You might also be able to help prevent sweet itch by feeding your horse certain foods. The idea is to change the smell of the horse’s sweat so that midges aren’t attracted – and won’t bite.You might try mixing adding apple cider vinegar to the horse’s feed, for instance. Also try feeding the horse two tablespoons of garlic powder twice a day.

, Anti-histamines created for humans have been shown to reduce symptoms of Sweet Itch in horses. However, this can be cost-prohibitive due to the large doses needed for a horse.Discuss this option with your veterinarian to determine the proper dose for your animal.

, Cortico-steroids (administered by your vet) have been shown to be extremely effective at suppressing the immune response that causes Sweet Itch. This relieves the itch and helps your horse’s lesions to heal.The use of steroids can make horses more susceptible to Laminitis.
As such, this method should be explored only in severe cases, or when other methods have not worked.

, A company called BioEos has created a capsule-based treatment that helps to correct the immune response. This capsule has been shown to cause a 50% improvement in 70% of horses with Sweet Itch.Discuss this option with your vet.

, Sweet Itch can induce violent scratching responses in your animal, leading to painful lesions and wounds. If the Sweet Itch lesions have created an infection, antibiotics may be needed to treat the problem, and help quell the itch.Once again, this is an issue to discuss with your vet.

, Dawn and dusk are the times of day when midges do their feeding. You can reduce your horse’s exposure to these biting insects by stabling them during these times, especially from about 4pm to 8am. Prevent midges from entering your stable by closing any doors and windows and/or ensuring screens are in place., The use of fans inside your stable is another great way to naturally repel the insects and help keep your stable midge-free. Midges can’t fly or land in strong breezes – anything over 5 mph is too much for them. It’s best to direct fans to the locations on your horse where midges tend to populate, such as around the neck and tail. This may require several fans., When you have rotting vegetation, manure, or standing water in or near your stable, you are creating an ideal environment for midge infestation.You can reverse the situation by:


Remove any rotting vegetation, such as leaves or hay.
Get rid of any puddles or standing water nearby.
Dispose of any horse droppings in your yard.

, “Barriers” may include sweet itch rugs, blankets, masks, and hoods. These garments protect your horse from midges (preventing further bites) while also preventing your horse from scratching and causing damage (or even infection). Sweet itch barriers are an excellent preventative measure, and they can also enable your horse to heal.It is important to keep rugs, blankets, and hoods clean and free of midges.
If possible, it is best to have two of each barrier method you choose, so that you can use one while the other is being washed.

, You may be able to help control the midge population in and around your stable by way of regular fly or insect traps. This may include things like glue strips, insect zappers, and/or catch and release traps. Install any of these devices outside or inside your horse stable to help keep the midges away from your horse., Midges breed in low-lying, wet areas such as marshy, boggy fields and pastures. Many horses with sweet itch can be controlled by turning them out onto hilltop pastures – away from these breeding grounds.

Hilltops pastures are also more exposed to wind, which will further repel midges from your animal.

If your horse will be hauled in a trailer:


Pick a route that has safe places to stop along the route.,
If your horse will be transported by plane:


Choose the quickest flight available, with the length of ground stops minimized.,
Only ship healthy horses.,
Make a basic first-aid kit for your horse.,
Avoid any unnecessary medication.,
During the days leading up to the shipping, ensure that the horse is drinking plenty of water.,
Weigh the horse before shipping.,
Well-ventilate the trailer by opening every window.,
Soak hay for 5-10 minutes in water before offering it in a hay net or bag.,
Stop every 4 hours for 60 minutes.,
Check on the horse during the haul.,
Keep the bedding clean.,
Upon reaching the destination, give the horse 3 – 7 days to recuperate.",How to Prevent Shipping Fever (Horses)," Ideally, you should stop to check the horse and offer water every 4 hours.
Consider a night journey. Traveling in the evening will avoid excess outside temperature fluctuations, likely avoid bad traffic (stops and starts aren't good for a horse), and the horse might be more relaxed. If this is what you choose, make sure the driver has slept well prior to the haul. Though night journeys have their benefits, this may not be a wise choice for an area with lots of deer near the road.
Check the stats. Journeys of over 500 miles (800 km) or 3 hours are associated with shipping fever. Stops should be made every 4 hours, in which the horse is let free to move about and also offered water. Transportation should be 12 hours maximum per day. At the end of the day, the horse should be comfortably stabled and rest for a minimum of 8 hours.;
, Usually ground stops are where the worst air is, and also where the temperature and humidity can fluctuate much more.
Maintain good air ventilation by using auxiliary ventilation systems. This is very important.

, If your horse isn't feeling well (for any reason), delay the shipping for later. Even if the horse seems healthy and happy, it's a good idea to check the temperature, respiratory rate, and other basic health-checks.


Horses with respiratory problems, nasal discharge, or a fever should especially not be shipped. There's a well-known saying when it comes to hauling horses, and it rings true: Sick horse on, sicker horse off.


, This should include sports wrap, packaged cotton, gauze, non-stick pads, and sport tape. Put these in some sort of container and place in an easy-access spot in your trailer.

, Tranquilization by a vet should also be avoided.

, As long as the horse is, and doesn't have a history of dehydration, electrolyte usage should be minimized or not used at all.

, Because horses can lose from 0.45 – 0.55% of their total body weight during shipping, you'll want a weight baseline for comparison, helping to know how long the horse takes to recover from the shipping. Healthy horses will usually regain their weight within 3 – 7 days after shipping, but horses shipped internationally or that have shipping fever can take longer to recover.

, This is very important. Even when it's cool, having fresh air will be much better for your horse.

, Alternatively, if it's a short haul, don't provide feed at all.

, This gives the horse time to rest its leg muscles, relax, drink water, and maybe doze off a bit.


Offer the horse water at the beginning and end of the stop. Don't freak out if your horse won't drink for the first few hours; these horses will usually drink water later in the day. However, if your horse hasn't offered to drink any water at all, it's urgent to increase the water intake. One way to do this is to offer them grain with some table salt stirred in. The salt will usually induce horses to drink using thirstiness.
Lengthen the horse's lead rope when stopped (but don't lengthen it too much). Studies have shown that having a horse's head in an upright position for an extended period can be detrimental to the horse's health. Don't lengthen it too much if your horse is new to trailering or likes to paw and may get a leg over the rope.
Generally it's easiest for both parties if you leave the horse in the trailer during each stop.

, If the horse gets injured, take immediate action with the first aid kit, and call your vet. Keep in mind that most first-aid wound solutions should not be used on the wound if you think it may require stitches.


If you notice that the horse's urine is more brown than usual, that's probably due to dehydration. Call your vet if your horse doesn't drink within 6 hours., This is important for long, all-day or multiple-day hauls. During stops, remove any piles or wet spots, and add more bedding if needed. When horse urine is left for a length of time it will start releasing ammonia. This is harmful and can cause respiratory problems for the horse.

, Hold off any big plans for later. This will also allow time to treat any health problems that occurred during shipping."

Put a fly mask on the horse.,
Try placing an eye patch on the horse.,
Avoid touching or irritating the eye.,
Let the vet examine the horse’s eye.,
Get a diagnosis from the vet.,
Discuss your treatment options.,
Check your horse’s eyes regularly.,
Make your horse wear protective head gear.,
Schedule regular check-ups with your vet.",How to Protect an Injured Eye on a Horse," You can protect the injured eye by putting a fly mask on the horse so dust and debris cannot get into the eye. A fly mask is a mask made for horses with two round protective patches, one for each eye. You can find fly masks at horse supply stores or online.To put the fly mask on the horse, have your horse to lower their head a few feet from the ground. Speak softly to your horse as you slide the fly mask onto their head, making sure the straps are secure around their chin.Make sure that the mask fits well, so that the horse can’t rub it off or get a hoof caught in it.
Fly masks will keep bugs and dust out of an injured eye, but they won’t stop the horse from rubbing its eye against things, which can make the injury worse.;
, You can also protect the injured eye by putting a protective patch on your horse’s eye. You may look for a protective eye patch made for horses at your local horse supply store or online.When you put on the eye patch, make sure it sits right above your horse’s injured eye. It should be flush to the area, as you do not want dust or debris to get into your horse’s injured eye.

, When you put on any protective masks or patches on your horse’s injured eye, make sure you do not touch the eye directly with your hand or any other objects. This can irritate the injury and make it worse. Do not put anything in the eye, such as medications or eye drops, without consulting with your vet first.Even if you think the eye injury is minor, it is a good idea to do home care on it and then take your horse to the vet for a check up. Getting a diagnosis from the vet will ensure your horse is not in any serious medical danger and that the eye is treated properly.
Be very careful with steroids. Putting steroids into an eye that has a defect or ulcer can cause the eye to get much worse, requiring many weeks of medication.
Applying anti-inflammatories to the eye before seeing the vet may mask some of the pain, but it will also prevent the vet from getting a clear view of the injury.

, You should consider an eye injury a true emergency and get the horse to a vet as soon as possible. An eye injury in a horse can get worse very quickly and you do not want to put your horse at risk of blindness or losing the eye. You may bring your horse to the vet or have your vet do a house call. Try to have your horse examined by your vet as soon as you notice the eye injury.During the exam, the vet may sedate your horse so they can get a better look at your horse’s injured eye. They may also perform nerve blocks around your horse’s eye so the eye stays open during the exam. Your vet may look for an obvious obstructions in your horse’s eye, from splinters to ulcers.
Try to find a dark, clean area with minimal draft before the vet arrives and where he can work. The darker the area, the better – this will help the vet see clearly into the injured eye.

, Your vet may be able to provide a clear diagnosis of your horse’s issue just by doing a physical exam of the eye. They may also need to run additional tests on the eye. You should discuss the diagnosis with your vet to determine how you can treat the issue.Common eye injuries in horses include a foreign body in the eye, a corneal ulcer, an eyelid laceration, or orbital fractures, often caused by getting kicked by another horse.
The position of horses’ eyes – on the upper outside portion of the head – means that eye injuries are very common, as they are not well protected and vulnerable.

, Your vet should outline the treatment options available for your horse’s injury. Follow your vet’s instruction and allow your horse to be treated right away so the eye issue does not get worse.Most eye injuries can be treated with a saline solution flush and anti-inflammatory medication. If your horse has an eyelid laceration, your vet may suture it up and apply antibiotics to prevent an infection.
Your horse may need medication applied every 2 to 3 hours through a lavage system. This can be a lot of work for owners and your vet may recommend that the horse stay in a hospital, where the injury can be monitored and treated on time.
In rare cases, your horse may require eye surgery. This is often the case if a corneal ulcer becomes severe or if an orbital fracture is very severe.

, To prevent eye injuries from developing, you should get in the habit of checking your horse’s eyes on a regular basis. You may do a quick eye exam every morning, being careful not to touch or irritate your horse’s eyes.Make sure your horse’s eyes do not appear to red, inflamed, or runny, as these could all be signs of an eye issue.

, You can also prevent eye injuries by getting your horse used to wearing protective head gear, such as a fly mask. Having your horse wear a fly mask can ensure dirt, debris, and other objects do not get into their eyes.You may also make sure your horse wears a fly mask in situations that could lead to eye injuries, such as dusty or dirty areas or aggressive horses that could end up kicking or hitting your horse’s head.
You can also find foam padding for your horse to wear while traveling in a trailer. This will protect its head and eyes.

, To keep your horse healthy and safe from eye issues, you should have regular check-ups with your horse’s vet. You may have monthly check ups with your vet or a check-up scheduled for every few months. As part of the exam, you vet should examine your horse’s eyes to confirm there are no issues or injuries."

Make carrot and apple cakes.,
Bake some crunchy oatmeal snacks.,
Prepare some oat bars.,
Try some cob cookies.",How to Make Horse Treats1," You can bake some simple fruity cake treats for your horse at home. Horses tend to love apples and carrots, so this recipe is normally a winner. Gather together one carrot, an apple, a cup of molasses, two and a half cups of oats, and some vegetable oil. Grate up the apple and the carrot, and then mix them in with all the other ingredients.


Place the mixture onto a shallow baking tray, and then place the tray in a pre-heated oven at 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
Bake it for around 40 minutes, or until they look golden brown.
Remove the tray from the oven and allow the mixture to cool for four hours in the fridge before you cut out the cakes.;
, For this recipe you will need a cup of dry oatmeal, a cup of flour, and a cup of chopped carrots. You will also need some sugar, salt, vegetable oil and molasses. Start by chopping up carrots into small pieces, and mix in the oatmeal and flour. Add a teaspoon of salt and one of sugar and mix it some more. Next, stir in two teaspoons of vegetable oil, before pouring in a quarter cup of molasses.


Stir the mixture thoroughly until everything is sticking together.
Use your hands to form the mixture into small balls and place them on a greased baking tray.
Put the balls into a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and bake for around 15 minutes, or until golden brown.Ensure they have completed cooled before feeding them to your horse.

, Another variation on the baked oats recipe are oat bars. You will need a third of a cup of oats, a third of a cup of sweet feed, a third of cup of molasses, and a third of a cup of flour. Mix all of these ingredients in a large bowl, starting with the oats and adding them one at a time. When the mixture is thick and sticky, mould it into a series of bars. You can wrap each bar in tin foil, or use a cookie cutter or mould if you have one.


Put the bars onto a greased tray and place them in a pre-heated oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
Bake the bars for around 22 minutes, before removing them and allowing them to cool in the fridge or freezer., You can make some simple baked cookie treats using cob feed (a mix of oats, corn, and barley). You will need eight cups of dry cob feed, three cups of ground carrots, half a cup of corn oil, two cups of flour and two cups of molasses. Gather all the ingredients and then mix them together well, in a large bowl. Leave the mixture to stand for an hour to enable the grain to absorb more of the moisture, and then stir it up again.


Scoop out teaspoon sized amounts and place them onto an oiled or greased baking tray.
Bake them in a preheated oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit, for between 12 and 18 minutes.
Cool the cookies on a cooling tray and then store them in an airtight container."
"
Try some “no-bake” cookies.,
Prepare a banana-glazed apple.,
Make some frozen grape pops.,
Try a healthy grass salad.,
Prepare a fruity salad.",How to Make Horse Treats2," You can make cookies and crunchy snacks for your horse without turning on the oven. One good recipe is for peppermint cookies. For five of these you will need a cup of rolled oats, a quarter cup of water, 1-2 tbsp. of molasses, and five peppermints. Start by mixing up the oats and the water. Stir it up together until the oats are all damp.


Next, you should add the molasses gradually, stirring as you go, until the mixture is nice and sticky.
Roll the mixture up into balls, and then press one peppermint onto each cookie.
Put the cookies in the fridge and wait for them to harden before treating your horse., For this treat, you just need an apple, a banana, and a handful of ice cubes. Start by peeling and then slicing up the banana. Put the banana pieces into a blender with some ice cubes and blend it until the mixture becomes creamy. Next, cut off the top of the apple and carefully scoop out the middle.


Spoon the creamy banana mixture into the hollowed-out apple.
Then pour out any remaining banana mixture onto the sides of the apples., Another fruity treat just requires a few carrots and bunch of grapes. Start by slicing the carrots into slim sticks. Then push one carrot stick into each grape so the grape stays on the end of the carrot stick, a bit like a popsicle. Then put the grapes in ice cube trays, so the carrots are sticking up, and put them in your freezer.Leave them in the freezer for a couple of hours so they go cold, but do not completely freeze.
Then you have a nice cool fruity treat to give your horse on a hot day.
Make sure the grapes are seedless, or you have removed all the seeds.

, You can mix up a nice salad as a healthy and delicious treat for your horse. For this variety you will need to start by gathering five chopped dandy lion plants (when they are in bloom, and excluding any roots). Combine this with two handfuls of chopped young bunch grass, or thick blade grass, and two handfuls of young wheat grass.


Add four cups of young pink clover (when in bloom), and a handful of chopped parsley.
The final ingredient is two washed and chopped up spinach plants.
Mix everything together well, and you will have a very healthy and delicious salad for your horse., For a slightly sweeter treat, you can mix up a delicious fruit salad. For this salad you will need two pears, an apple, four carrots, a quarter of a watermelon, and a plum. Cut all these ingredients up into small pieces and mix them together. Add a spoonful of cod liver oil, and mix it in well.


This will make a big salad that you can share with more than one horse.
You can add extra vitamins and minerals to the salad if necessary."

Tie your horse in a safe suitable environment.,
Know the normal vital signs:


The average normal temperature is 37-38ºC but this varies from horse to horse.,
Use a thermometer.,
Move the horse's tail to the side, so that it is out the way.,
Leave the thermometer in position for at least three minutes or until it beeps.,
Be aware that the pulse rate will increase if horse is excited, nervous, in pain, has a disease or during/after exercise.,
Find the pulse.,
Use your forefinger (never your thumb as you may feel your own pulse).,
Use a clock or counter to time a 15 second period.,
Watch or feel the horse's ribcage/belly for one minute.,
Use a stethoscope, if possible.,
Lift horse's upper lip.,
Check for fast color return.",How to Take a Horse's Vital Signs," If needed, have an assistant hold the horse.

, For a mare, the average is 100ºF (37.8ºC) and for a stallion, the average is 99.7ºF (37.6ºC).The normal pulse rate is 36 to 42 beats per minute. The resting heart rate is 28 to 40 beats per minute.The normal respiration rate is between 8-12 breaths per minute. At rest, it is between 8 to 14 breaths per minute.The average capillary refill time is two seconds.

, Lubricate the tip with petroleum jelly or Vaseline.;
, Insert the thermometer into the horse's rectum, angled slightly towards the ground.

, Take a reading after this time is done.


Always clean the thermometer before storing it.

,


If the pulse is weak, strong or absent, this can be a sign of heart disease or a specific defect.The horse must be promptly seen by the veterinarian.

, The pulse can be found near front of left jawbone; under the jawbone, there is a major artery that sticks out slightly.

, Press against the artery firmly.

, Multiply the number of beats you counted by four.


Alternatively you can place your hand or a stethoscope behind the horse's left elbow to take his pulse. Be sure to count each lub-dub as one beat.

, Be sure to count one inhale and one exhale as one breath (not as two).


If you are having difficulty seeing the ribcage move, try watching the horse's nostrils or place your hand in front of the nostrils to feel the horse exhale.

, An even better method is to place a stethoscope to the horse's windpipe to listen to its breathing. This will also give you strange sounds if the horse's windpipe is blocked by mucous or if the horse has allergies or heaves.

, Firmly press your thumb against the gum for two seconds to create a white mark.

, The mark should return to normal salmon pink color within two seconds of releasing the pressure.


If the CRT takes longer than 2 seconds, the horse may have shock.

Look for common signs that a horse is choking.,
Call the veterinarian immediately.,
Prevent the horse from eating or drinking anything else.,
Keep the horse as calm as possible.,
Keep the horse standing with its head down.,
Touch the horse's neck to find the lump.,
Feed your horse soft foods for the next week or two following an episode of choke.,
Keep a steady supply of water for your horse.,
Prevent your horse from cribbing (chewing or licking a wood structure).,
Schedule twice yearly dental care.,
Change your horse's eating habits.",How to Help a Horse With Choke," One common sign is a lump in its neck. There are also several things that a horse will actually do when it is choking. Despite showing these signs, be aware that a horse may still try to eat or drink.Coughing
Yawning
Arching neck
Drooling
Difficulty breathing;
, If you are not the horse's owner, contact the owner to let them know about the situation.

, Choke will get worse if a horse continues to eat and drink, so do your best to keep the horse from any potential food and drink sources.Move the horse to a stall that does not contain any bedding. The horse may want to eat the bedding, so it will be important to remove all potential food sources.
A horse will become dehydrated quickly, but do not to allow it to drink water from a bucket.

, A horse may become increasingly anxious and restless if it is choking, which could put you in danger of injury. Do not approach the horse if your safety is at risk.


If necessary, the veterinarian will sedate the animal to calm it down.

, This will help prevent food from going into the horse's airway, which could cause respiratory complications.Keeping the horse standing will also keep it from giving up, which could easily happen if the horse lies down.
If you have a head-collar/halter on hand, use it to hold the horse and keep it standing. However, do not attempt to hold the horse if your safety is at risk.

, The lump will indicate where the food has become stuck in the esophagus. Do not touch the horse's neck if the horse is too restless or anxious to approach.


If the horse will allow you to touch its neck, try to gently massage the lump to assist in its removal.
If the object is something soft like an apple, it will dissolve after 5-15 minutes. If it is not gone by then, it will probably be something harder or more dense, like a carrot.
Blockages can also occur from dry foods such as sugar beet. If not soaked properly, dry foods will swell and cause the same result. This can only be removed by the assistance of a veterinarian with proper equipment.

, An example of soft food is water-soaked pelleted feed., Water will help the horse wash its food down, making it less likely that the food will get lodged in the esophagus.

, Horses may choke if what they crib on comes off and they swallow it.

, Keeping your horse's teeth properly filed will help ensure adequate chewing of food before swallowing., Changing the consistency of the food, as well as changing how your horse eats, can help prevent choke.


Feed smaller portions more frequently.
Soak pelleted feed in water for older horses that may not be able to chew as well and would thus be more prone to choke.Cut food such as apples into smaller pieces. Also, cut carrots into strips instead of circles.
Place rocks into your horse's feeder. By having to pick through the rocks to get to the grain, a horse will slow down its eating.Schedule more frequent turnout time so that your horse has the chance to graze between meals; increased grazing may slow down how quickly your horse eats grain."

Check your horse’s temperature.,
Take your horse’s heart rate.,
Check their respiratory rate.,
Test your horse’s hydration.,
Check their gum color and capillary refill rate.",How to Give First Aid to a Horse1," Grab a 6-inch veterinary thermometer, and shake it out till the temperature reads somewhere around 95 degrees. Add a bit of petroleum jelly as lubricant to the end of the thermometer, and clip a clothespin to the other end for better grip. Stand just to the side at your horse’s rear, and insert the thermometer into their rectum. Allow it to set for 2-3 minutes, and then remove it and check the temperature.


The average temperature of a healthy adult horse is 99-101 degrees. For a foal, this is slightly higher at 99.5-102 degrees.
A temperature change in 1-3 degrees is no problem, but if your horse’s temperature has risen 4 degrees or more there may be an issue.
Remember to consider things like hot weather or a heavy workout before jumping to sickness as the cause of your horse’s rise in temperature.;
, For the easiest way to check the pulse of a horse, use a stethoscope. Hold the end of the stethoscope to the horse’s chest, just behind the left elbow. A single ‘lub-dub’ is a single pulse; time yourself for one minutes and count the number of pulses you hear. For a healthy horse, the resting heart rate should be somewhere between 35-42 beats per minute. Anything much higher or lower than this may indicate a health issue.

, Make sure your horse’s breathing isn’t out of sync by checking their respiratory rate. Stare at their rib cage, and watch for it to rise and fall. Time yourself as you count the number of times you see their rib cage expand over the course of a minute. A healthy horse will have a respiratory rate of 8-20 breaths per minute.


If your horse has recently exercised, has been in hot or humid weather, is pregnant, or is very old, they may have a higher respiratory rate without being ill.

, When it is especially hot, your horse has been working very hard, or you are concerned about possible illness, check your horse’s hydration levels. Pinch a piece of skin from their chest or shoulder between your forefingers, and then let go. If your horse is hydrated and has plenty of fluids, the skin should return to its normal state in a second or less. If your horse it mildly dehydrated, it will take 2-4 seconds to return to normal. Severe hydration is indicated by peaked skin lasting 5-10 seconds., If you’re worried about your horse experiencing a toxic reaction, shock, or severe hydration, test their gums. Lift their lips and apply pressure to a spot on their gums with your finger, waiting until it turns white. Then, release the pressure and count how long it takes to return to its normal pinkish hue. A healthy horse will have color return in 1-2 seconds.


If it takes 3-4 seconds (or longer), your horse may be experiencing health problems and you should consider calling a vet.
If the gums are not pink but red, your horse may have consumed a toxic substance.
If the gums are whitish in color all around, your horse may have had blood loss or may be in shock.
If the gums of your horse are blue or turning blue, contact your vet immediately as it is a sign that they are close to death."

Check your horse’s teeth regularly.,

Notice if there are any whole grains in your horse’s droppings.,
Watch out for signs of ‘choke’.,
Call your vet if you spot these signs of pain.",How to Take Proper Care of Your Horse's Teeth," Every responsible horse owner should regularly check their horse's teeth on a regular basis.


Fully visualizing all tooth surfaces of the molars requires specialist equipment, but you are still able to check the incisors and the molars for any obvious problems or signs of discomfort.
Ideally, you should check your horse's mouth as part of his bridling up routine each time he is ridden, but failing this, check his teeth at least once a week.;
, Take a moment to smell the horse's breath. This helps you to familiarize yourself with what is normal, so if the horse develops halitosis (bad breath) you will recognize it.

, An adult horse has 6 upper and 6 lower incisors at the front of the mouth. To inspect them, peel the upper lid up and lower lid down. Look from directly in front of the horse, and then from both the left and the right hand-side.


In profile, the biting edge of the teeth should meet in a smooth line. The enamel surface should be free from cracks and the teeth firm in the head, not loose or wobbly.
There should be no swelling or change of gum color where the crown meets the gum. There should be no discharge coming from around the gum line.

, It is normal for there to be a gap between the incisors at the front of the mouth, and the molars to the rear. This gap is known as the diastema.


Some young horses grow extra ""wolf"" teeth, or tushes, in this gap. These teeth, which are technically known as the first premolars, start to erupt with the adult teeth and erupt from about 5 to 12 months of age.It is important to recognize if these teeth are present or not because the bit will knock against them and cause the horse pain. Thankfully, it is a simple procedure for the vet to extract these teeth.

, To the rear of the mouth are the molars. These are the grinding teeth that the horse uses to chew its food. If spurs develop they can dig into the cheek, or tongue, depending on the location.


If you have a placid horse, or one trained to let you open his mouth, with the aid of a head torch you may be able to peer in and inspect the lingual (tongue-side) aspect of the molars. However, the tongue frequently sits in the way and so the view will be poor. The biggest clue to a spur on the lingual aspect is seeing blood stained saliva on that side.
For the buccal (cheek) side, place the flat of your hand on the horse's head and slide it over the cheek whilst applying gentle pressure. If a spur is present it will dig in slightly and the horse will resent the exam, pull away or shake his head.

, Check a foal's mouth to ensure the incisors meet neatly. Some anatomical abnormalities which can happen include sow mouth (overshot lower jaw, which means the upper row sit behind the lower) and parrot mouth (undershot lower jaw, which means the upper teeth are further forward).


These issues need to be identified as early as possible so the vet can advise you as to whether corrective procedures are necessary.
A foal has a full set of 24 milk (deciduous) teeth by 9 months, and these begin to fall out from 2 ½ years of age. Even foals and young horses can develop spurs on their teeth, so be sure to be vigilant for signs of discomfort.

, Check for the presence of wolf teeth in the diastema and get your vet to remove them before introducing the bit.

, The horse will shed his deciduous teeth as his adult dentition grows through. However, sometimes the milk teeth do not fall out cleanly but become wedged between neighboring teeth.


This is known as ""capping"". The retained tooth traps food and can set up infection, so the capped tooth needs to be removed by the vet.
Signs that a horse has a capped tooth include bad breath (from trapped food), playing with his tongue a lot, quidding, drooling, and dropping grain from his mouth.
Because the adult teeth erupt at different rates it is not unusual for a young horse to have a problem more than once, and repeated vet exams may be necessary.

, Most adult horses have between 36 and 44 teeth. The adult should be fully present from 6 years of age, and problems are usually down to spurs on the molars. The permanent teeth are open-rooted, which means they continue to grow through most of the horse's adult life, in order to replace the crown which becomes worn down by chewing.


However, if the rate of wear is uneven, spikes or spurs develop which painfully dig into the cheek or tongue. These need to be ""floated"" or rasped down by your veterinarian.
Signs of spikes include quidding, whole grain in droppings, drooling, and bloody saliva.

, Although the teeth are open-rooted and continue to grow, they do have a finite life. Increasingly, with improvements in general veterinary care, horses are living longer than the lifespan of their teeth.


This means some of their teeth may fall out and the horse finds it difficult to chew. An elderly horse that loses condition, drops food from his mouth, or drools heavily, needs to have his teeth professionally checked.
You can help a horse that has lost teeth by feeding him soft foods such as beet pulp or hay cube mashes. These are highly digestible and have a good calorific content to keep his weight up.

, Just as it does for us, sugar can cause dental decay in horses. Keep sugary treats to a minimum and give sugar free mints, or preferably carrots, as a reward.

, Teeth can break or crack, so be careful that you don't knock the bit carelessly against teeth.

, Grazing and chewing with the head down promotes even wear on the teeth. Where possible, encourage feeding near to the ground – although be wary of anything that could trap a leg and cause trauma.

, As the horse chews, he may tosses his head around as if in discomfort. When this happens, he is likely trying to avoid chewing on certain teeth and physically moving his head in response.

, Trapped food or bacterial gum infections can lead to bad breath, a cardinal sign of dental problems.

, If the bit comes into contact with a sore place in the mouth, the horse may flex his neck, or grip the bit between his teeth, in an attempt to prevent it from touching that area.

, If spurs dig into his cheek as he chews, the horse may learn to chew up hay and hold it as a protective pad against his cheek. When he has finished eating he drops the pads out on the stable floor, where you can find them.

, If it hurts to chew then the horse won't completely grind up his grain, but swallow some whole. This travels through his gut and can been seen as whole, undigested grains in his droppings.

, If the horse does not chew his hay properly it contains less saliva. When he swallows it can form a dry ball which gets stuck in his gullet (esophagus) in a condition known as ""choke"".

, It is important to be vigilant for signs of oral discomfort. Even if a check-up is not due, if your horse has mouth pain it is time to call the vet."

Treat a laceration.,
Treat any swelling from a kick or fall.,
Treat an eye injury.,
Treat a puncture wound.,
Treat a tack sore.",How to Give First Aid to a Horse2," Rinse the wound thoroughly using light pressure from a garden hose, or ideally, flush with clean water or betadine/chlorhexadine solution(diluted)using a 60cc syringe with an 18 gauge, 1 & 1/2"" needle attached to the syringe. Following flushing, lightly scrub with betadine or chlorhexadine surgical scrub if handy. Apply several gauze pads over the wound, and cover them with one or more large quilted pads.


If you don’t have chlorhexadine surgical scrub, Ivory dish soap or any other mild soap will suffice.
Bandaging wounds on a lower limb are easy, but anything higher (stifle, shoulder, hock or upper body) are difficult places to keep a bandage in place.
If the wound is on the lower limb, apply a clean telfa pad, then wrap a quilted pad and an elastic bandage, and make sure it is secure, but not so tight as to interfere with circulation., Have the horse stand still with the swollen leg in a bucket filled with Epsom salts and lukewarm water, if the swelling is on the lower limb. If the horse is fidgety and will not stand still, you can dip a quilted stable bandage in the Epsom salt water and bandage the leg to reduce the swelling. After the horse has been standing with its leg or hoof in the bucket for about ten to thirty minutes, apply a poultice, either homemade or store bought to the swollen area

, If you notice pus or discharge in your horse’s eye, your horse has a swollen eye, or you see a small object stuck in their eye, treat it at home to relieve your horse of their discomfort. Remove any objects or items that you see that are stuck in the horse’s eye. Then, use an equine eye rinse to flush the eye and remove any discharge. You can follow up with a soft, damp rag to wipe away any remaining discharge or solution.

, Most typically found on the hooves of the horse, punctures can be dangerous because they appear to be minor while they are in fact very deep. Refer to your vet for the treatment of puncture wounds, but in the mean time remove the object (and save it) and clean the wound with clean water. Then, have your horse stick their foot in a bucket of warm water that has epsom salts dissolved into it.


If your horse won’t stand with its foot in the bucket, you can soak a quilted pad and wrap their hoof with it. This may be more difficult though.

, Ill-fitting tack can cause minor sores and cuts to appear after a long or strenuous ride. As long as the sore isn’t too deep and isn’t infected, treatment at home is appropriate. Trim the hair around the sore, and then clear the area with clean water. Clean it out with betadine and smear a thick paste of antibiotic ointment or vaseline over the wound to keep it from getting infected.


If you’re out on the trail when you notice the sore, cut a piece of 2” foam in a donut shape around the sore, and tape it to the bottom of the tack. This will prevent the tack from rubbing the wound and making it worse as you continue to ride.
If you notice tack sores, have a professional help you determine if your tack truly fits and ways that you can improve its fit.

Use salt that is meant for animal consumption.,
Add the salt to your horse’s feed.,
Try putting granulated salt in a bucket attached to your horse’s stall.,
Make sure your horse gets lots of fresh water.",How to Make a Salt Lick for Horses1," Look for salt made for horses at your local pet store or feed store and buy it in bulk. Check that the salt is not a mineral salt blend, such as red salt, or salt that is meant for de-icing roads. If you are introducing your horse to a salt lick, start with plain white salt or iodized table salt.The type of salt that is best for your horse will depend on his nutritional needs and his current diet. If your horse only needs sodium and chloride, table salt is a great option. Some horses may do better with iodized salt or trace mineral salt if they are not getting enough supplements in their diet.
If you are giving your horse commercial feed or a vitamin/mineral supplement, he does not need iodized salt as he is already getting enough iodine in his diet. A build up of iodine in your horse can lead to other health issues.Always talk to your vet before you give your horse any homemade products, including a salt lick.;
, Start by giving your horse two tablespoons of salt a day for a few days in his feeder. Gradually build up to a full dose of four tablespoons of salt a day so your horse can get used to the taste of the salt.If your horse lives in a very hot climate or sweats profusely every day, you may want to start with two tablespoons a day and up the dose to five to six tablespoons a day over a period of one to two weeks.Most horses will regulate their own salt consumption and only consume as much salt as they need. If your horse appears to be salt starved, start with a controlled amount in his feed to help his body adjust to the salt intake slowly.

, If you would rather allow your horse to consume salt of his own accord when he feels salt deprived, you can fill a bucket halfway with granulated salt and hang the bucket in an area that is easy to access in your horse’s stall. Look for a location that will protect the bucket from the weather.This is a good option for horses who are just starting to get used to salt in their diets, as free-choice salt consumption may be more inviting than licking a salt block that will be rough on your horse’s tongue.

, Giving your horse lots of fresh, clean water will help the salt to circulate properly in his body. As well, the water will help your horse flushes out any excess sodium and chloride from his system.


If your horse is getting too much salt, and not enough water, he may drink an excessive amount of water and urinate more often than usual. As long as you provide enough fresh water in his stall, in addition to salt lick, he should be able to balance his salt intake with his water intake.

Be aware of the possible issues with a salt blocks.,
Make the salt block.,
Pour the 14 lbs of salt, 3.3 lbs bone meal, 1.3 lbs lime, and 3.5 lbs clay in a large bowl or tub.,
Remove the excess water from the mixture.,
Use your hands to mold the mixture into blocks.,
Hang the salt block in an easy to access spot in your horse’s stall.,
Provide lots of fresh water to help your horse stay hydrated.,
Keep the salt block clean.",How to Make a Salt Lick for Horses2," Salt blocks were originally designed for cattle, who have rough tongues that make it easy to get salt by licking a hardened salt block. Horses have softer tongues and may have a hard time getting the salt they need from a salt block, especially if they are older or have bad teeth. Keep this in mind when you are deciding between a loose salt mix that you scatter in your horse’s feed or his stall and a salt block you hang in his stall.Some horses can also overindulge in salt if they have access to a salt block. As a horse owner, you have less control over how much salt your horse consumes when you give him a salt block. However, a salt block requires less maintenance and often horses will regulate their own salt intake when they have access to a salt block., Use mineralized salt if your horse’s feed does not contain any minerals or if you are not giving him a vitamin/mineral supplement. If you do use feed or a concentrate with minerals or a vitamin/mineral supplement, you can use plain, white salt.To make your own salt block, you will need:14 lbs of table salt, iodized salt, or mineralized salt.
3.3 lbs bone meal.
1.3 lbs lime.
3.5 lbs clay.
Water.
A large bowl or tub.
A large wooden spoon or stick.
Old pots and pans.
Avoid adding a sweetener, like molasses, to your salt blocks. Horses can consume too much of the molasses salt block at once due to the sweet taste and this can lead to health issues.

, Add enough water so the texture becomes soft and easier to mix together. Use the large wooden spoon or stick to mix the ingredients until they are well blended.You should continue to add water so it is easy to stir and blend the ingredients but do not add too much water as you do not want the mixture to become watery. The mixture will have the right consistency when you can easily stir and blend the mixture with the wooden spoon or stick.

, Once you feel the mixture has been thoroughly mixed, drain as much water as possible from the mixture by molding the mix, squeezing water out, and draining it. Do this until you cannot get any more water out of the mixture., Most salt blocks for horses come in five pound blocks so try to mold the mixture into blocks that are around four to five pounds.


Place the blocks in old pots or pans so they can harden. Leave the blocks in a cool, shaded area to allow them to dry and harden. This will take about two weeks.

, You can hang the salt block using rope or simply put it on the ground in a spot that is easy to access in your horse’s stall. Check to make sure your horse is ingesting enough of the salt block, especially if you have multiple horses in one area. One horse should consume a five-pound salt block within two months if he is getting enough salt in his diet.Keep in mind hanging the salt block will ensure it stays cleaner for longer, and more appetizing, than if it is lying on the ground in the dirt and the hay.

, It’s important that you give your horse lots of fresh, clean water so his body can process the salt in his diet. Having access to fresh, clean water, as well as a daily salt intake, will ensure your horse flushes out any excess sodium and chloride from his system.

, Over time, your horse’s salt block may get dirty due to exposure to the elements and exposure to dirt and hay in his stall. Keeping the salt block clean will make it more enticing to your horse and encourage him to use the block. Clean the block as needed by hosing it down with water in a metal or plastic tub.

Decide on the type of grain.,
Choose the amount to feed.,
Boil the grain.,
Make sure you have a saucepan, and place on the stove top.,
Place the grain in the saucepan.

,

Turn the stove top off and let it expand by its self.,
Test the grain.,
Let the grain cool.,
Feed the horse.,
Repeat for future boiling.",How to Cook or Boil Whole Grains for Horses," There are many grains today, and only a handful can be fed to horses, these include barley and oats. There are other grains available to feed, but precautions need to be taken during the boiling and feeding. Linseed needs special care as if it is not boiled correctly causes a build up of acid, and also the toxins (which you boil out of them) don't get removed and get into the horses body. Wheat should also not be fed at any time. Though Bran and Pollard are By-Products of this grain, Wheat expands and causes a build up of lactic acid, causing laminitis and founder. It also causes grain poisoning. Whole Barley is often the most common boiled, as Oats tend to heat horses up. However, if feeding race horses or horses that are not being ridden such as a halter stallion or broodmares, then Oats is a good feed to help put weight on these horses.;
, At first you should always begin a new feed product slowly and gradually, so it is recommended feeding only 1 cup per day and after a few days feed 2 cups per day after a week or two you can feed the correct amount of grain. However, if fed in excess can be the cause of major health conditions. So only feed about 2kg of grain per day, (dried).

, Using a cup measure, measure out the 1 cup for starters, as your horse gets use to the feed, you can increase it as suggested.

, Don't turn the stove on yet. The saucepan should be a large one, as the grain more than doubles its size. The bigger the better.

,, Ensure the grain is completely covered with an inch or more water above the grain.

, It is recommended that you use the highest setting.

, You need to ensure that you bring the grain to the boil. This ensures the water is the hottest it can be. After the water has began to bubble and boil, reduce the heat to a medium simmer, (about setting 2 or 3 from the lowest).

, If you boil the grain at night, it is best to do this step early, and if not, then progress straight to the next step. During this step make sure the lid is on the pot to prevent evaporation of moisture.

, As the grain gradually cools down, it will absorb the moisture. You may need to add more water after an hour or so so as to keep it moist so it doesn't dry out and become hard. If you are boiling in the morning, then leave for a few hours, if at night, it is best to leave overnight with the heat off. By the morning, the grain will be only slightly warm and you will notice the grain may have expanded much more.

, After the grain has expanded, you will be able to squeeze the grain and the flesh will pop out. If it is hard, leave for longer.

, Turn off the heat and leave for about half an hour, or until you can touch the grain with your fingers.

, The grain should be cooled, but still warm,as this makes it more appetizing, but you can feed it cold.

, Change your routine if you find that it is easier to boil at night rather than in the morning. Often this is found because you will be able to wake up and the grain will be cooked. Some herbs can be added straight to grain during the simmering steps. Chamomile, which is best used as a Tea, can be added and the juice can be fed when cooled, this has the extra added benefits of both grain and chamomile tea.

Use fine-point tweezers.,
Grab the tick by its head.,
Gently pull upward.",How to Remove a Tick from a Horse1," Use fine point or needle nose tweezers to remove the tick. Do not use blunt tweezers. By using blunt tweezers, you will risk squeezing the tick’s stomach, which could cause it to regurgitate its stomach fluids into the horse.;
, With your tweezers, grab the tick as close to the horse's skin as possible.Apply enough pressure to grab the area where the head attaches to the neck. However, be careful not to apply too much pressure. Too much pressure can cause the tick's body to break off with its head still embedded in your horse’s skin., In a slow, vertical motion, gently pull the tick until it detaches. Do not squeeze, yank, or twist the tweezers while you are pulling the tick. This can cause the body to detach from the head, leaving the head embedded in your horse’s skin.The tick is completely removed if all of its head parts are gone from the horse’s skin. You may also see bite marks in your horse’s skin, and possibly parts of the mouth, but as long as the head is removed, you can assume that the tick has been removed safely.
Pull the tick directly upward from the skin to get the smoothest removal possible.

Slide the knot down the straw.,
Tighten the knot around the tick's head.,
Pull the thread in a steady upward motion.",How to Remove a Tick from a Horse2," Place an ordinary drinking straw at a 45-degree angle over the tick. The purpose of the straw is to guide the string's knot down to the tick’s head., Take cotton thread or dental floss and tie a loose knot around the top or at the midsection of the straw.

, Slide the knot down the straw to where the tick is attached to the horse’s skin. Position the knot around the tick’s head and/or neck, i.e., below its body.

, Once you have the string around the tick’s head, slowly tighten the knot around the head.


Make sure the knot is around the tick’s head and not its body. If you tighten the knot around its body or midsection, this could cause the tick to regurgitate its stomach into the horse. , Once the knot is fastened around the tick’s head, gently and slowly pull the thread in a steady upward motion until the tick detaches itself.The tick is completely removed if all of its head parts are gone from the horse’s skin. You may also see bite marks in your horse’s skin, and possibly parts of the mouth, but as long as the head is removed, you can assume that the tick has been removed safely.

Sterilize your tools.,
Remove any mouthparts that are left behind.,
Clean the site.,
Place the tick in a sealed jar.",How to Remove a Tick from a Horse3," Cleanse your hands with soap and water before you begin the removal procedure.

, It is advised that you wear latex gloves when removing the tick. This is to prevent the tick from latching onto your own body, as well as to prevent any of the tick’s saliva or blood from getting on your body., Clean the instrument that you will use to remove the tick with soap and water.

, There might be parts of the tick’s mouth still left behind in the horse’s skin. You can remove these with a sterile needle or with the help of a doctor. However, like a splinter, the mouth parts will usually work themselves out after a few days or weeks, but it may cause itching., After the tick is removed, clean the area with a mild disinfectant, like soap and water. Also wash your own hands as well. You can apply triple antibiotic to the area if there is a wound.


Be sure to wash our hands afterwards, as well.

, Unfortunately, ticks are very hardy creatures, and you cannot simply throw them away or flush them down the toilet. To ensure that they are dead, place the tick in a sealed glass jar that has been filled with rubbing alcohol. Leave it in there for a few days to make sure it is dead.Alternatively, if you want to get the tick tested, place it in a sealed glass jar and refrigerate it until you can bring it in for testing.

Locate ticks on your horse.,
Keep your horse calm.,
Call a veterinarian.",How to Remove a Tick from a Horse4," Ticks can attach themselves anywhere on your horse’s body. However, ticks usually attach themselves to places on the horse’s body where there is longer hair, for example, in the horse’s mane and tail or around the ears. Ticks also like to attach themselves to the horse’s fetlock. The fetlock is the area on the back of the horse’s hoof, or the heel, so to speak, where longer hair grows on some horses.Don’t forget to check the warm and fleshy areas of your horse’s body, such as the girth, armpit, and flanks. Ticks can crawl into these places to feed.

, Removing ticks from your horse, especially from the horse’s back area, like its tail or hind legs, can cause your horse to become anxious. Therefore, before you begin the procedure, make sure your horse is calm and trusts you by talking to it in a reassuring voice while rubbing its head. You can also give your horse its favorite snack, like carrots. This will help keep the horse calm throughout the procedure.


If your horse begins to become anxious in the middle of the procedure, stop what you are doing and proceed to calm your horse again. Because it is an action your horse is familiar with, you may also try brushing your horse’s mane or tail in order to calm your horse.

, If your horse’s skin develops a reaction to the tick bite, i.e., by turning red or swelling, call your veterinarian. Also, if your horse is severely infected with ticks or if there are ticks in your horse’s ears, it is advised that you call a veterinarian right away to remove these ticks."

Look for the horse biting or rubbing itself excessively.,
Pay attention to a loss of appetite and weight loss.,
Notice changes in behavior.,
Assess your horse for sensitive or infected areas.",How to Treat External Horse Parasites1," A horse that has external parasites likely is irritated by them. In order to relieve any itching or pain, your horse will rub, bite, or scratch any areas that it can get to.Rubbing and biting areas of discomfort can lead to areas of hair loss, as well as open sores. If your horse has these issues, then there may be an underlying parasitic infection causing it.;
, Some parasites move from the outside of your horse into its inside, affecting your horses digestion and nutritional intake. For example, bots begin as eggs on the outside of a horse's body but develop inside the horse once the horse ingests them.Bots in the stomach will affect a horse's digestion, causing both diarrhea and loss of weight.

, Horses that have parasitic infections may have different personalities or behaviors than they usually do. These changes are caused by the discomfort or pain that is associated with the infection.If your normally calm horse becomes aggressive or scared all of a sudden it could be the sign it has a parasitic infection. However, it could be a sign of another illness, so have your horse checked out by a veterinarian if this occurs.

, Your horse may have a newly sensitive area that it does not want you to get close to. This area may just be tender due to itching, so the horse is protecting it, or it may be opened and infected.Tender areas may have been rubbed raw by the horse or they may be areas that the horse can't access but the parasites are breeding in.

Eliminate breeding grounds.,
Apply repellents.,
Apply insecticides.,
Consider veterinary treatment.",How to Treat External Horse Parasites2," Flying parasites, such as flies, mosquitoes, and Gnats, breed in moist locations around your horse. Clean up stalls, making sure to eliminate areas with moist hay, bedding, grass, or manure.Wash out stalls and surrounding areas regularly, so flying parasites have fewer chances of breeding.


To get rid of mosquito and gnat breeding grounds, eliminate any standing water in the areas around your horse's stall. This includes puddles and natural bodies of stagnant water, as well as water buildup in buckets, tires, etc.

, Treating flying parasites usually includes deterring the them from landing on your horse. Even if they are in the area, if you can keep them off your horse, then the problem is eliminated. One way to do this is to apply an insect repellent that is approved for use on horses. Consult with your veterinarian to find a product that will help with your horse's particular problem.


Another way it to apply petroleum jelly to areas on your horse that flies like to bite. Flies do not like land on it, as it can eliminate their ability to fly.

, Using insecticides requires a lot of care and know how. Consult with your veterinarian about products that can be used to kill flying parasites, how to use them, and how to avoid poisoning your horse in the process.Follow the directions for whatever insecticide you decide to use. The directions should include how long you can use it, how to apply it, and how to dispose of any leftover product.

, If your horse's infection is extensive, then it is a good idea to get a professional to look at the horse. This is especially important if the flying parasites have irritated the horse so much that it has open sores or areas of hair loss.

Treat the infection with an insecticide.Crawling parasites, such as mites and lice, should be killed by an insecticide.,
Keep the horse clean.,
Consider cutting areas of the mane that are highly infected.,
Clean the horse's tools, stall, and surrounding areas.",How to Treat External Horse Parasites3," This insecticide usually needs to be applied several times, so that the adults and the eggs are all killed. Consult with your veterinarian about the best product to use for your horse's particular infection.


However, ticks, which are another common crawling parasite on horses, need to be removed by hand.
If your horse has mange, which is a serious mite infection that affects the skin, it will also need a pesticide treatment., Good grooming practices can go a long way to treating, as well as preventing, a mild external parasitic infection.If you are trying to get rid of an infection, you should groom your horse every day, brushing it and picking its hooves, making sure that its coat and feet are clear of parasites, as well as mud and dirt.Grooming your horse every day allows you to inspect your horse's body for infections as well.

, In the case of a serious infection, such as mange, it is a good idea to cut the mane to eliminate areas where the infection can fester. This only needs to be done if your horse's infection is serious and your veterinarian thinks it will help get the condition under control., It's important to disinfect all of your horse's surroundings, as well as all supplies you use on it, in order to eliminate any adult parasites and their eggs. Clean stables regularly, replacing bedding and washing it out completely.


Avoid using supplies you use on an infected horse on other horses. Many common crawling parasites are easily transferred from one horse to another on contaminated tools, such as brushes, blankets, and any other tool.

Apply fly gel.",How to Protect Your Horse's Eyes from Flies1," One of the most common remedies used to keep flies away from your horse’s eyes in an insecticide fly spray. There are many kinds of sprays on the market. To ensure that you do not damage your horse’s eyes, spray the insecticide generously onto a grooming mitt, and then wipe the mitt around your horse’s eyes.If the spray should get into your horse's eyes, flush with cold water.
In general, the product should be reapplied every 4 hours.
Both fly spray and a grooming mitt can be purchased at your local equine supply store or online.;
, Another product similar to fly spray is an insecticide roll-on repellent. This formula makes it easier to apply the insecticide directly to your horse. Simply shake, remove the cap, and use the roller-applicator to apply the repellent above and below your horse's eyes.In general, the product should be reapplied every 3-4 hours.
Roll-on repellent can be purchased at your local equine supply store or online.

, Another great choice is insecticide towelettes. These individually packaged wipes make it easy and convenient to apply insecticide and keep flies away from your horse’s eyes.The product should be reapplied every 3-4 hours.
Insecticide towelettes can be purchased online or at your local equine supply store.

, Finally, fly gels (or lotions) provide another easy way to apply insecticide directly to your horse, without the risk of spraying it into their eyes. Use your hand or a grooming mitt to apply gel above and below your horse's eyes.This product should be reapplied every 4 hours.
Fly gels (and lotions) can be purchased at your local equine supply store.

Use a fly mask.,
Ensure a proper fit.,
Try “fly strips” that cover the eyes.",How to Protect Your Horse's Eyes from Flies2," A fly mask is a fitted, mesh barrier worn on your horse’s head that can very effectively protect their eyes from flies and other insects. There are masks that cover only the top half of the face, full-face styles (that cover the nose), and masks that completely cover the face and ears. Experiment with different styles to find the right level of coverage and comfort for your horse., In order for a fly mask to be effective, it is crucial to find the right fit. You must be sure that the fly mask is not too loose or too tight on your horse. Additionally, you must check to see that the ear coverings are a comfortable fit. A poor fitting fly mask can lead to irritation, and may even injure the eyes of your horse.For a proper fit:

The mask's lower edge should reach 1-1.5 inches (2.5-3.8 cm) below the bottom of your horse's cheekbone.
There should be a couple of fingers' width between the mask edge and your horse's throatlatch.
Make sure that the mask's ear coverings and/or ear-holes are aligned with your horse's ears. Also, make sure the openings are roomy enough for his ear size.
Finally, be sure that the eye coverings rest far away from the eyes, with enough clearance for the horse's eyelashes. (You should never see eyelashes poking through the mesh).

, If you have a picky horse that doesn’t seem to like wearing a fly mask, you can opt for minimalist mesh fly strips that go over your horse’s eyes. These may be slightly less effective than a full mask, but they are a good choice for some horses."

Use flytraps.",How to Protect Your Horse's Eyes from Flies3," Manure is a magnet for flies. You can help to keep your horse’s eyes safe but swiftly removing all manure in your stable area., Like manure, flies are drawn to dank areas with standing water. If possible, eliminate puddles and other places where water has accumulated to reduce the fly population and keep your horse’s eyes safe., A natural way to target the fly population in your area is to introduce predatory wasps. These can usually be obtained from your local feed store. Simply allowing a nest of wasps to accumulate in your area will significantly impact the flies.These wasps are not dangerous to horses.

, Finally, a simple way to reduce the number of flies that have access to your horse is to install flytraps in and around your stable. This may include glue strips, insect zappers, or catch and release traps."

Assess its weight and growth in comparison to its appetite.To assess your horse's weight, use a weight tape or a tape measure to figure out how much it weighs.


To estimate a horse's weight, you will need to measure the girth of its heart and belly as well as its length from head to tail. Then use an online calculator to estimate its weight.A horse with worms may have an enlarged stomach, even though it is losing weight. In very serious cases, this stomach enlargement may be visible on the outside of the horse.;
, An unhealthy coat can be a sign that your horse has a parasitic infection.Brush your horse as usual but pay close attention to the thickness and sheen of the coat all over your horse's body. This includes even the horse's belly and its legs. Is it as shiny as usual? Is the hair thinning in any areas? This may be a sign that your horse has parasites.


A dull and drab coat could be caused by a parasite. This is because the parasites draw nutrition from the horse, giving it less than ideal conditions for a healthy coat.

, In addition, this decrease in energy, combined with acute discomfort, such as itching or pain, can cause your horse's personality to change.


If your horse has suddenly become skittish or unfriendly, the change in personality may be due to illness.

, Internal parasites in horses often cause digestive problems, such as diarrhea. If your horse has not had any changes to its diet lately but has started having diarrhea, then the cause of new digestive problems could be parasites such as ascarids or threadworms., An ascarid infection, which is a common parasitic infection in foals, can cause respiratory problems, as the larvae travel through the respiratory system.If your foal is having an off-season cold, it may be caused by parasites.

, Some parasites can be seen on the horse. This includes mainly external parasites but also includes internal parasites that exit the openings in the horse's body. Some parasites that can be seen on a horse's body include:Pinworms: These are long, thin, and white larvae that can be seen on the anus of the horse. In addition to causing hair loss around the anus, they can be seen when the females lay their eggs in the anal region of the horse.
Bots: While bots develop in the stomachs of horses, their eggs are deposited on the outside of the horse, where the horse licks them due to irritation and then ingests them. Look for bot eggs all over the horse but they are usually deposited on the inside of the horses knees.They are small white dots that show up in groups.
Flies: These can be a real irritation to a horse, as the can bite and sting a horse.If there are a lot of flies around your horse, then you should work to eliminate them on your horse and in your horse's area.
Mosquitoes: Mosquitoes can be a nuisance for horses but they can also spread infections, such as encephalomyelitis and West Nile virus.If there are a lot of mosquitoes in your horse's area, or you are seeing them bite your horse, then you need to work on eliminating them.
Ticks: If you have taken your horse into areas that could have ticks, you should look your horse over afterword for any sign of the parasite. Ticks can give your horse anaplasmosis or lyme disease, which are both serious bacterial infections. Look for black dots on your horse, which may be swollen with blood.

, If you suspect a parasitic infection, you should contact your veterinarian and discuss your concerns. The veterinarian will let you know if and when you should get the horse looked at.


Many symptoms of parasites are also symptoms of other illnesses. For instance, weight loss or diarrhea can signal parasites or other illnesses. Thus, your veterinarian may not be able to pinpoint exactly what the problem is without examining the horse.

, Most internal parasite infections can be identified with one of two fecal tests, fecal flotation and fecal egg count.The fecal egg count is done by looking for and counting the number of eggs in your horse's feces.Fecal flotation allows a veterinarian to look at parasitic eggs through a microscope to identify what exactly they are. With these tests, the veterinarian can assess what type of infection, if any, your horse has, as well as how severe the infection is. Parasites that can be identified with these tests include:


Large Strongyle (blood worms or red worms)
Small Strongyle (cyathostomins)
Roundworms (Ascarids)
Bots
Strongyloides
Tapeworms

, Many parasites are treated differently, so it's important to follow your veterinarian's suggestions to eliminate the specific parasite it has. This will usually include some sort of medication and suggestions for future care.


Be sure to continue medication for as long as directed, so that the infection can be completely eliminated.

, There are some universal things you can do to minimize parasites in general and to help with the healing process.One of the most important of these is to keep a horse's area clean. This means cleaning the horse's stall daily, removing bedding and cleaning the entire surface.


Be especially vigilant about removing manure, as this can promote parasitic larvae growth.

, You do not want the horse to ingest any more parasites, which happens in many cases through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. In order to prevent this, you will need to keep manure out of eating areas.Clean eating areas and containers daily. Spray them down and make sure that they are totally clean and dry before refilling.

, When treating one horse for parasites, you want to avoid spreading the infection to other horses. Keep the horse that is infected physically separated from other horses.Additionally, avoid cross contamination by keeping grooming tools and cleaning tools that you use on a contaminated horse separate from those you use on an uncontaminated horse.

, Try to keep parasites out of your barn, stalls, or any areas close to you horse. For example, get rid of stagnant water in and around your horse stalls. The will keep mosquitoes from breeding in the area."

Invest in a physical trap.,
Make your own trap.",How to Get Rid of Horse Flies1," Nontoxic physical traps work best in areas with a lot of livestock, people, or important plants. Here are some physical trap options that are effective against horse flies:



Light traps. The lights on these traps are especially chosen to attract unwanted insects. When the insect lands on the light, it is either trapped on glue cards or zapped and killed instantly.

Flypaper. This paper contains an adhesive that both attracts and traps house flies and horse flies.

Flies-be-Gone fly trap. This trap holds fly food in a plastic bag for bait. The fly must enter the bag through funnel. Once inside the bag, the fly cannot escape.

Horse Pal fly trap. These large traps have a target specifically designed to attract primarily visual hunters such as horse and deer flies. When the flies approach the target and see that it is not prey, they get trapped in the metal portion of the trap and die from the heat of the sun on the trap.;
,


Hang the chair or stool from the ceiling of your shed or other place where horse flies congregate.
Attach a dark colored, medium-sized ball to a rope. Attach the rope to the bottom of the chair or stool so that the ball dangles down.
Attach Flypaper to the bottom of the chair or stool. Every few hours, start the ball swinging. Because horse flies are attracted to dark color and movement, they will be attracted to the ball.
When they fly over and see that it is not interesting, they'll fly upwards and get caught on the paper.

Pick a chemical.,
Treat your livestock directly.,
Apply insecticides to areas around your property.,
Spray a large area that will protect multiple properties.",How to Get Rid of Horse Flies2," Certain chemicals are just about as effective as others. To prevent insect resistance, it's a good idea to rotate different chemicals when you treat the area. Possibilities include:



Pyrethroids (cypermethrin, fenvalerate, permethrin, resmethrin, tetramethrin, s-bioallethrin, sumithrin);

Organophosphates (coumaphos, dichlorvos, malathion, tetrachlorvinphos)

Organochlorines (lindane, methoxychlor)

, Always double-check that the chemical you're using is safe to apply directly to livestock. Then:


Use a small mist blower or a handheld mist sprayer to mist the chemical over your animals.
If your animals are spooked by the sprayer, then dip a sponge or a mitt in the chemicals and rub the sponge or mitt on your animals.

Always wear rubber gloves. Never let these chemicals come into contact with your skin.

, Spray a resting areas or barns around the eaves, walls, ceiling and and rafters.


Always remove your livestock from the barn before you spray. Some of your animals may have to stay outside for a while. Just follow the directions on the packaging.
Coarsely spray resting areas with insecticides. Make sure to spray under low pressure.
Be careful not to contaminate your animals' water and feed buckets. Also, keep the spray off of your farm equipment.

, Spraying a big area is efficient; it won't require too much time or labor. However, area sprays tend to have a short-lived effect.


Use aircraft, loggers, hydraulic sprayer or mist blowers to dispense the chemicals.
The find chemical droplets will travel to where flies live, killing the insects.

,
Perform annual rituals like castration during the winter season.",How to Get Rid of Horse Flies4," Clean up manure, old bedding and spilled feed. If needed, you can spray your manure pile with insecticide to keep larvae from developing.

, Build proper drainage systems and eliminate buckets of standing water. Cover your pool or pond at the peak of horse fly season.

, Horse flies can find a suitably moist and cool breeding ground in tall grasses and weeds. Insects sometimes also retreat to shady vegetated areas during hot parts of the day. To avoid this, keep your grasses trimmed and weed on a regular basis, especially along ditches.

, A barn, stable or doghouse will give your animals a place to retreat when horse flies are bothering them outdoors. Make sure that windows and doors are screened to prevent horse flies from entering.

,, The fly population should be minimal at that time, which will prevent horse flies from flocking toward the animals' wounds.

Determine if your horse needs deworming.,
Talk with the veterinarian about deworming resistance.,
Discuss medications.,
Correctly dose your horse.",How to Deworm a Horse1," Since this will completely depend on your horse, you'll need to submit a feces sample to your vet. The vet will run a fecal egg count test to find out if your horse has worms and what kind they are. This allows your vet to choose the most effective dewormer for that particular infestation and how often your horse needs to be dewormed.For example, a horse with a heavy worm burden may need monthly deworming, but one with few worms could be done quarterly or even twice a year.;
, Deworming your horse unnecessarily can lead to an increased resistance to the worms. For this reason, your vet may recommend rotating deworming drugs (giving four to six different dewormers) before starting back at the beginning treatment. Since some horses can develop a natural resistance to worms, they may not need deworming at all which is why a fecal analysis is important.If your horse has a heavy worm burden, a daily dewormer might be help prevent heavy worm infestation between regular deworming. But, daily dewormers shouldn't be considered a complete deworming strategy on their own since their effectiveness is limited against certain parasites and total deworming treatment is required before starting them., Your veterinarian will talk with you about deworming medications. These include fenbendazole, ivermectin, moxidectin, pyrantel, and praziquantel. Since each drug has a subtly different spectrum of activity, your vet will decide what medication will work best for your horse.The following are drug classes to consider:Benzimidazoles (such as fenbendazole) can kill nematode eggs, unlike other drug classes, and are available as granules, pastes, and suspension formulas. These medications are usually given several days in a row.
Macrocyclic lactones (such as ivermectin and moxidectin) are some of the most effective medications and can, in addition, kill external parasites like lice and mites. They do take 3 to 4 days before treatment is effective.
Isoquinoline-pyrazines (such as praziquantel) are only effective against cestodes (in horses, Anoplocephala spp., also known as tapeworms.) In the United States, this drug is only available in combination with macrocyclic lactones.

, You'll need to know your horse's weight since the medication is dosed by body weight and prescribed by your vet. Treatment will be ineffective if not enough medication is given, which can also encourage drug resistance. The majority of dewormers are very safe, so it is better to overestimate the amount rather than underestimate, especially if your horse dislikes dewormers and is inclined to spit them out. Plan to give extra in anticipation of the horse spitting part of the dose out.Be aware that many dosing syringes of horse dewormer contain enough for a 1,200 lb horse. If you have a large horse, you may need two syringes. Some veterinarians suggest adding on the amount required for another 250lbs (one mark on the dosing syringe) regardless of your horse's size.To find out your horse's weight, buy a measuring tape from a feed merchant or tack store. Measure around the horse's chest and see how the weight corresponds on a scale that gives an estimate of the horse's weight.

"
"
Get the horse and medication ready.,
Insert the syringe.,
Administer the dewormer.",How to Deworm a Horse2," Your horse's mouth should be empty, with no wads of grass or straw in it. These could make it easier for the horse to spit the medicated paste out. Your horse should also wear a halter which will give you something to hold onto when administering the dewormer. Have the syringe ready by removing the cap and dialing the dosing ring back to the appropriate mark on the barrel of the syringe.You may want to feed and water your horse before giving the medication, since the taste of dewormers might keep your horse from eating or drinking for a while. This is especially important if your horse has exercised and is hotter or thirstier than usual., Aim the nozzle onto your horse's tongue by lifting the lips and angling it towards the back of the mouth. The best place to place the syringe is the gap between the incisors and canines at the front of the mouth and the molars at the back.Make sure you're able to hold the plunger in such a way that you can easily press the plunger.


Do not worry too much about the exact placement of the nozzle. As long as it is inside the mouth, chances are the dewormer will coat either the tongue, teeth, or lining of the cheek and most of it will be swallowed., Press the plunger down to squeeze the medication into your horse's mouth. Be quick so as not to upset your horse. Once all the medication is inserted, remove the plunger and hold your horse's head up for a few seconds. This will keep him from spitting the dewormer paste out.If your horse routinely spits out the medication, try inserting smaller amounts at a time or mix the paste into his food.

"
"
Buy a pellet dewormer.,
Measure the pellets.,
Feed your horse the pellets.",How to Deworm a Horse3," Pellet dewormers are mixed with your horse's grain. Ask your veterinarian to recommend a particular pellet dewormer brand and dosage. The package you choose should also say how often to feed your horse, based on weight.


Write down a deworming treatment schedule as recommended by your vet. You'll need to feed your horse the right dose of pellet dewormer for as long as suggested.

, Use the scoop that's included in the package to measure out the correct dose of pellet dewormer. Mix this into your horse's grain feed. Only mix enough for a single feeding, not the entire day.Avoid mixing the pellets into treats rather than grain.


Grain ensures that the whole dosage is consumed, while your horse could pick around the pellets or refuse them altogether if you include them with treats.

, Offer your horse the grain feed mixed with dewormer pellets. Make sure he finishes the food, so you can be sure that all the medication was eaten. If your horse won't eat all of the pellets and grain, add a little liquid molasses to encourage him to finish it.If you plan on feeding your horse hay, be sure to wait until after he's eaten all of his grain feed with the pellets mixed in.

Develop a deworming program with your vet.,
Include an insecticide in the deworming program.,
Use caution when deworming foals.,
Treat and quarantine all new horses.,
Have your vet perform regular fecal exams.",How to Prevent Parasites in Horses1," Antiparasitics, commonly known as dewormers, kill parasites in different ways, including paralysis and interrupting the life cycle. Many types of dewormers are available and they come in several formulations (e.g., oral paste, feed additives). In addition, there are various strategies to give dewormers, including rotating drug types several times a year and targeting specific parasites.Examples of dewormers are ivermectin, fenbendazole, and pyrantel pamoate.With so many possibilities for giving your horse dewormers , it could be hard to know what will work best for your horse.
There is no ‘one size fits all’ deworming program for horses. Your vet will recommend an individualized deworming strategy for your horse. This strategy will depend on various factors, such as geographic location and the number and age of your horses.Follow the deworming program carefully to ensure your horse does not suffer from parasites.;
, Adult bot flies lay their eggs on a horse’s hair coat, causing annoyance and irritation. If the horse bites or licks at the area where the eggs are laid, the eggs enter the body and eventually hatch into larvae, called bots, that live in the stomach. These bots can cause stomach inflammation and ulcers.Using an insecticide will break the flies’ life cycle and prevent a bot infestation. Strategies for using an insecticide are below:Use an external insecticide after the eggs are laid but before they hatch.
Apply the insecticide by rubbing it into the affected areas with a sponge soaked with warm water. In response to the warm water and insecticide, the eggs will hatch and then die.
Wear gloves when applying the insecticide.
Use the insecticide weekly when the flies are most likely to lay eggs. This time period may vary according to your geographic location. Your vet can help you determine when to use the insecticide.
Talk with your vet about using an internal insecticide.

, Foals are especially susceptible to parasites called ascarids, which are thick, white worms that can grow up to 1 foot (12 cm) long. Ascarids can cause poor body condition, colic (abdominal pain), and respiratory problems.To help a foal grow into a healthy adult, start deworming it at 4‒8 weeks of age and repeat every 30‒60 days according to your vet’s recommended deworming schedule.Do not give daily dewormers to your foal. Foals need some exposure to internal parasites so they can build up immunity to the parasites. A daily dewormer would kill the parasites before immunity could develop, possibly causing more severe reactions to parasites later in life., To prevent the introduction of parasites into your horse’s environment, quarantine and deworm new horses.Your vet will recommend how long the new horses should be quarantined and dewormed before being introduced to your horse.

, Regular fecal exams are essential to an effective deworming program. Before beginning the deworming program, a fecal exam will allow your vet to identify specific parasites, determine the severity of infestation, and decide which dewormers to prescribe. During the deworming program, regular fecal exams will help your vet determine if the dewormers are effective and if you should give them more or less frequently.Your vet will examine a sample of fresh manure to identify parasites and count the number of parasite eggs. Twice-yearly fecal exams are recommended, but your vet will let you know how often they would like to perform the exams.Be aware that a negative fecal sample does not always mean that your horse is free of internal parasites.Some parasites have developed resistance to certain dewormers.High parasite egg counts could indicate dewormer resistance.

Group horses together according to age.,
Perform pasture rotation.,
Have sheep, goats, or cows graze after your horses.,
Do not overcrowd pasture areas.,
Remove manure regularly.",How to Prevent Parasites in Horses2," Foals have weaker immune systems than those of adult horses. Therefore, foals could get very sick if they graze with adults in a pasture area that has a heavy parasite load. If you have multiple horses, put them in groups according to age before turning them out to pasture. This will decrease the likelihood of foals getting exposed to heavy parasite loads.If a horse has internal parasites, the eggs would pass through the feces and hatch into larvae (developmental stage before adults) on the ground. While grazing, a horse could ingest these larvae, which would develop into adults in the intestines.

, Pasture rotation involves moving horses from pastures with a heavy parasite load to those with fewer parasites. It also prevents overgrazing, which increases the chances of a horse ingesting parasite larvae. Deworm your horses before moving them to a new pasture to prevent contaminating the new pasture with parasites. If you have foals, move them to the cleanest pasture to minimize their exposure to parasites. Below are more tips for pasture rotation:Divide your pasture areas into multiple sections.
Move your horses when the grass in the current pasture area is 3‒4 inches high.
Mow the grass after moving your horses to a new pasture.
Allow the grass to grow back to about 8 inches before putting your horses back in that pasture area.

, Sheep, goats, and cows (collectively known as ‘ruminants’) will not get sick if they ingest horse parasite larvae. Therefore, they can graze in pastures after horses without a problem. As they graze, the ruminants will decrease a pasture’s parasite load.Have the ruminants graze after moving your horses to a new pasture area.

, If there are too many horses in one area of pasture, that area could get overgrazed, increasing the likelihood of parasite larvae ingestion.There is no universal standard for the number of horses per acre of land, so your vet can help you determine how much grazing area each of your horses should have.

, Manure management is key to preventing parasites in horses. Remove manure weekly from pasture. After removal, either compost and spread it or discard it.Because 1 horse can produce as much as 40‒50 pounds (18‒22 kilograms) of manure per day, regularly removing manure from your pastures will be important.
Spreading the manure dries out and kills parasite larvae.If you spread the manure after composting it, do not spread it in the areas where your horses graze.Your local agriculture extension department can provide guidance on proper spreading of manure.Contact a professional manure removal company if you are not able to compost and reuse the manure.

Clean your horse’s stall regularly.,
Feed your horse from a rack or trough.,
Remove bot eggs from your horse’s coat.",How to Prevent Parasites in Horses3," When horses defecate in their stalls, parasite larvae can crawl up the sides of the stall walls. If your horse licks the walls, it could ingest the larvae and become infected. Clean the stall to prevent parasite infections.At a minimum, muck the stalls once a day. Tips for cleaning horse stalls are below:Use proper cleaning equipment: metal pitchfork, broom, scrub brush, a large bucket to hold the manure, and a wheelbarrow.
Keep your horse out of the stall when cleaning. Either tie up your horse outside the stall or put it out on pasture.
Remove the manure with the pitchfork and place the manure in the wheelbarrow. Sift the bedding through the pitchfork to minimize how much bedding you need to replace.
Clean the water bucket with clean water and a scrub brush.
For an intensive cleaning, remove everything from the stall to sweep and disinfect the floors and walls. Disinfect the water bucket as well. Allow the stall to dry completely before restocking the stall. 10% bleach is a good disinfectant.

, If your horse eats off the ground, it could ingest parasite larvae while eating. To prevent this, put your horse’s food in a rack or trough.Clean the rack or trough regularly with clean water and a scrub brush., Adult bot flies tend to lay their eggs on the insides of a horse’s knees, where a horse could easily lick them up.The eggs are tiny and white. To remove them, you can use a fine-toothed comb or a dull blade.


If you use a dull blade, be careful not nick your horse’s skin and cause bleeding.
Bot knifes are also available that can remove the eggs. In addition, you could use sandpaper or a synthetic stone grooming block.

Consult equine vet or breed specialist to establish the ideal weight for your breed of draft horse.,
Understand that exercise is the most crucial part of any breed of the Draft Horse's weight loss.,
Begin with simple work such as leading or lunging the horse.,
Remember to rest your horse.,
After 1-2 weeks of leading or simple walking lunging, your horse's exercise may be increased.,
After another 1-2 weeks of painful beginning work, truly push your horse.,
Change the riding period about 3/4 of the time.,
Begin trotting exercises towards the end of your weeks.",How to Get a Draft Horse to Lose Weight,";
, Although the best way for Draft-horses to stay in shape is the work it was breed to do, for example, hauling drays, pulling logs, ploughing or other agricultural work or being ridden by knights in full armour with their weapons. You may not be able to work your draft horse in manner it was breed for, and some people believe it is not an efficient or healthy way to begin shaping down your horse.

, Leading your horse with the lead rope in simple circles or taking a walk down a non-busy street will help your horse begin the weight-loss process. During the first days, practice for about 30-45 min. Don't feed your horse for at least an hour after replacing it in the stall.

, Beginning work should have at least 1-2 days off a week, allowing the Draft to relax. If your horse is in absolutely torrid shape, this can be increased to 3 days a week and the slow, leading exercises can be increased for up to 2 weeks. 


Remember to keep your horse going in a straight line, and make sure that he is picking up his hooves. This is so he can begin building muscles in the right places for harder, better-working work.

, Very light riding, with the required specialist saddle and technique required, may begin, but only if the horse has a fitting saddle and is broken in for riding. When beginning the riding, keep it light and at a slow walk - preferably in a small arena. Only ride the draft for 1/3 of the time your exercising, using the rest of the time for leading. By now, the horses exercise time should be upped to around 45 minutes.

, Begin by riding your horse more (hopefully still in the arena - remember to keep the horse in steady, straight lines) often. The time of riding each-day can be morphed into an hour of work. Riding should be increased to 2/3 the time. Keep 1-2 rest days a week to keep your horse feeling fine.

, This will be the longest period of time and it will be greatly used in the future. Up the time of exercise to about 2 1/2 hours during this time (gradually! A few days of 1 hr. than 4-6 days of 1 hr. 10 min. and than 4-6 days of 1 hr. 20 min. etc.)


Over this time, you can begin riding outside of the arena on flat ground. Simple street-riding or riding in flat meadows is good. Continue using 1/4 of your time with leading or lunging (this is best used for warming up the horse, and then using the rest of the time for riding). This is the longest, most painful period and usually should last at least 4-6 weeks (preferably longer if the horse will be doing hard, fast work).

, This should be about Week 5 or 6. Keep the trotting very low, and make sure that the horse has been walked for at least 20 minutes before beginning trotting. You should walk the horse for at least 15 minutes after trotting as well, to warm-down. Only allow the horse to trot for a maximum of 25 min. and for only max 3 min. at a time.

Start walking beside him, holding both ""reins"", and slowly fall back to about three feet directly behind him.,
Continue walking, and turning with soft pressure on the reins.

,
Do about three sessions of this (depending on how well he understands), then attach something heavy to him.,
Continue having him drag the branches.",How to Keep a Miniature Horse Fit," This is very easy and lunging at the jog works nicely for getting your horse in shape. Just as with other physical exercises, start small and gradually add time and strenuation to the lunging.;
, Just as with big horses, some Miniature horses enjoy jumping and are also quite skilled at it. While you may have to start by leading your horse over the jumps (and also jumping them yourself), ideally you should be able to lunge or even free-lunge your horse over the jumps. Start with getting your horse in shape with lunging before advancing to jumps.


It's a good idea to use protective boots or wraps around your miniature horse's front legs, especially if he is light-boned.
If you don't want your horse jumping non-elevated cavalletti poles, use a distinct voice command for when to jump than when to go over the poles in stride. An example of this is to say ""hup"" right before you want the horse to jump, and ""easy"" when you want the horse to take it in stride.

, Depending on the build and size of the mini, the weight limit ranges from about 20 to 60 pounds.


To find the weight limit for your mini, it may be wise to seek advice from your vet.

, It may be wise to start training your horse to drive to see how he likes it before buying a cart.

, If not, a halter will to for now.

,,, It is best not to start teaching a pony how to cart with the actual cart, because a confused mini could hurt himself with the it attached.

, If he stops, be sure you're not tugging on his mouth, and say ""walk on"" and give him a tap with the dressage whip on his haunches.

,, Branches work well, but avoid wheelbarrows or anything that could tip and scare him.

, If your mini enjoys it and you do too, buy a cart. Once you do, you can take him all around in his cart, and exercise him well, too.

You'll need to take your horse to the veterinarian to ensure your horse is healthy. If your horse has a medical condition, the veterinarian will be able to prescribe the correct treatment, which will most likely help your horse regain any lost weight.The two major causes of weight loss in horses are internal parasites (worms) and poor dental conditions.;
, You may notice that your horse is shy when you try to put the bit in his mouth. Or, he might be a messy eater, dropping partially chewed lumps of food on the ground and in his water bowl (a process known as ""quidding""). Your horse may do these because he has tooth problems. But, if your horse is feeling pain when he chews, he may cut back on eating rather than deal with the pain, so there won't be other symptoms.As horses age, they can develop points (sharp edges), hooks (a jagged tooth that doesn't make contact with the lower or upper teeth), and waves (unevenly worn down molars) in both the upper and lower teeth (arcades). These can prevent them from chewing their food properly, resulting in a loss of nutrients.

, Get your veterinarian to look at your horse's teeth to determine if the weight loss may be caused by tooth problems. Your vet may be able to tell if the horse isn't able to sufficiently break down his feed.


A horse's teeth continue to grow until the mid-twenties, so it's a good idea to have them examined and floated (rasped down) every year, if they need it., Your veterinarian should run a complete egg count on a sample of your horse's feces to identify specific species of parasites (worms). If your horse has a large population of redworms (Cyathostomiasis), he's probably experiencing gut inflammation or stomach ache, and is unable to completely digest his food. Once the species of worms has been identified, your horse will be de-wormed 2 separate times, about 3 weeks apart. This gets rid of adult worms, as well as the developing eggs and larvae.Horses are more likely to have worms if they have grazed on pasture that has been heavily grazed by other horses and that are heavily contaminated with horse feces which harbor the worm eggs.
Red worms account for around 95% of worm eggs in pasture, so infection is highly under the right circumstances. Other species that are found in pastures, like strongylids worms, can also cause weight loss.

, While you may not want the expense, the test will show if your horse is deficient in any essential minerals and if all of the internal organs are functioning properly. This information can help you determine if the horse needs supplements. The veterinarian will also examine your horse for other problems which could interfere with his ability to eat, such as respiratory disease, chronic diarrhea, gastric ulcers, or behavioral problems.Some behavioral problems can interfere with eating, such as wind sucking or crib biting. With these, the horse sucks in a lot of air when chewing, which can cause stomach bloating. This makes him feel full, when he's actually just full of air., Horses are scored on a scale of 1 to 9 according to their amount of muscle and fat. This is figured by looking at, feeling, and ranking 6 areas of the horse's body.The veterinarian can help you determine your horse's score which will let you decide if your horse needs to gain weight. The ideal body score is a 5 or 6.Scores of 1 to 4 are considered thin, and will need more feed to boost weight.
An extremely underweight horse will need a feed that is high in protein and fats (such as rice bran) to promote weight gain.

, Talk with your local feed merchant. The merchant will know the benefits of the various feeds that are stocked. Describe your horse's condition, so you can get a good recommendation on what feed you should be purchasing. Just remember not to feed a lot of grain, since these can be hard for your horse to digest.You can also ask the advice of fellow equestrians. Many of them may be able to offer helpful tips and tricks to build up your horse's condition.

, If your horse is thin, ask your vet to recommend a target weight. You'll then want to look at the feed package and weigh out how much he should be eating a day. Don't use a scoop, since this can be inaccurate and you may be overestimating how much you're feeding your horse.Be sure to feed for your horse's desired weight and allow him access to a pasture.


An average horse will need 1.8 to 2% of body weight in feed (including supplements). So, an average horse in good condition needs about 18 to 20 pounds of feed a day.If you're trying to fatten your horse, consider upping the amount of food by 2.3 to 2.5% of body weight for a slow gradual gain.

, If your horse is severely underweight, consider feeding him a high-protein hard feed which is calorie dense. You can give a high energy extruded (shaped) food (500-700g for every 100 kg of body weight) mixed with an equal volume of chaff (straw cut up for fodder or seed husks). Or, you could feed rolled barley and dampened rice bran in the same quantities.


Avoid suddenly increasing the quantity of food, which could cause your horse to gorge and develop diarrhea or even colic. Decide on the amount of feed for the horse's target weight and divide it into 3 to 4 feeds spaced over the day., Grass is the staple food of the horse's diet. Without it, your horse may not be eating enough bulk (roughage), causing him to be thin. Make sure your horse gets at least 3 to 4 hours on grass, but don't just turn him out and let him graze all day. Not only will he strip the pasture down to the ground, but he will overload his gut and could develop laminitis, diarrhea, or colic as a result.Consider giving the horse good quality hay before you turn him out into the pasture, which can keep him from eating too much fresh grass. Hay can also regulate the bowels and provide slow release energy for your horse.
Limit pasturing on lush spring grass to 2 hours (1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon). This grass is rich in carbohydrates, which greatly increases the risk of laminitis or diarrhea., Start by adding just a 1/4 cup of oil to your horse's feed per day, adding another 1/4 cup within a few days. Build up to about 2 cups of oil a day. You can use corn, peanut, canola, or vegetable oil.Adding oils to your horse's feed will help increase his weight and can aid in digestion.


While your horse is on a higher calorie diet, make sure he's getting a little light exercise. This way, your horse will start to condition and build muscle."

Look for physical signs of an infection.,
Look for behavioral symptoms.,
Get a veterinary diagnosis.,
Medicate your horse.,

Keep your horse isolated.,
Prevent future infections.",How to Get Rid of Strongyle Infestations in Horses," A strongyle infection will have an impact on your horse's health. If your horse has an advanced strongyle infection it may lose weight, have diarrhea and abdominal pain, exhibit unusual weakness, or even suddenly die.The symptoms of a small strongyle infection and a large strongyle infection are very similar. However, the main difference is that large strongyle affect more body systems because they travel throughout the body during their lifecycle.;
, The discomfort caused by the parasites not only affects the physical well being of the horse but physical discomfort can impact the mental well being of the horse as well. Thus, horses with severe strongyle infestations may become depressed and withdrawn and show signs of general discomfort.Pay attention to signs that your horse is withdrawn. For example, its posture may change and its response to you appearing at its stall may change from excited to indifferent., If you suspect that your horse has a strongyle infection, then it should be checked out by a veterinarian. Your veterinarian will be able to give you a definitive diagnosis and instructions for proper treatment.


If you suspect your horse has a strongyle infection you should keep a record of the horse's symptoms and when they occurred, so that you can give this information to your veterinarian.
A diagnosis is usually done with a flotation test or inspection of the horse's feces to identify eggs and worms.The flotation test can show a general strongyle infection but a fecal culture is needed to figure out if the infection is small or large strongyle., Large and small strongyle are treated with a antiparasitic drugs, such as pyrantel pamoate, ivermectin, and oxibendazole.Follow your veterinarian's instructions for dosing and length of time to give to your horse.


Dosage and the length of treatment will vary depending on the severity of the infection and the regional conditions that could affect the infection. For example, in regions that have high rates of infection, your horse may need to be on anti-parasitics for a longer period of time.
There is a risk of developing parasites that are resistant to antiparasitic drugs if these drugs are given too often or in too high of doses. Because of this, only horses with active infections should be given the medication, even if you have other horses in the same area.

, With small strongyle, the larvae can embed themselves in the lining of the intestine, protecting themselves from the immune system of the horse, as well as many deworming medications. These larvae can emerge from the intestine wall all at one time, flooding the system and potentially even killing your horse. Because of this, treatment with fenbendazole or moxidectin should be given in high doses if a severe infection is diagnosed. Discuss the need for aggressive treatment with your veterinarian. If the infection is impacting your horse's health, aggressive treatment may be necessary. Weigh the pros and cons of the various possibilities for treatment with your veterinarian.
Treatment should be given in the winter particularly, as movement of the larvae into the intestine wall usually occurs during this time of year.
If the infestation is very severe, your horse may need additional treatment with corticosteroids to fight it off.

, Strongyle infections are very contagious, especially for horses that spend time in overcrowded pastures. This is because when the adult strongyles migrate out of the horse on feces, they move from the feces onto blades of grass. When other horses then eat the grass, the strongyles enter their digestive system, starting the cycle all over again.If you have an infected horse, and other horses have been spending time in the same pastures as the infected horse, then the other horses need to be checked for an infection.
Even if the other horses are not infected, you will need to put them on an preventative medication to eliminate the risk of infection.

, As with most infections, it is better and easier to prevent the infection than to treat it once it has been established. Routine anthelmintic treatments, which are antiparasitic drugs, should be given to prevent small and large strongyle infections.Additionally, pyrantel tartrate can be given to your horse daily to prevent a small strongyle infestation. This medication is put onto your horse's feed and it prevents larvae from developing once they enter the body.Be sure to administer these preventative drugs under the watch of a veterinarian, who can direct you about what medications are needed and when they should be administered.

"
After researching a good exercise program, write out a customized program for your horse a week at a time.,
Trails are a great place to start.,
Add extra weight with saddlebags full of water bottles or weights for a cardiovascular and leg muscle workout.

,
Arena work is important, too.,
Extended periods of long-trot and canter will build cardiac endurance, and remember to give loosening walk breaks when your horse gets winded.

,
Always warm up and cool down before every ride, to prevent colic and pulled tendons.

,
If possible, ride every day.,
Check your horse’s feet often.,
Feed high-quality hay and/or grass.,
Play polocrosse.,
Remember, always have fun with your horse, and make sure that he/she is having fun, too.",How to Get a Horse in Shape," Remember to start small.;
, They help take the “boring” out of a really long ride, and the different terrain and obstacles are great for your horse, too. Some tips are listed here:


Walk up hills. This builds your horse’s rear, and helps with canter work. Horses can walk up quite steep hills, but start out with smaller ones at first, and be sure to check the footing.
Trot over small logs that have fallen down. This causes your horse to pick his legs up higher, building muscle useful for expressive collections and great self-carriage. For a back-muscle building workout, walk over small logs going uphill and downhill. This causes horses to pick up their shoulders and use their back muscles, therefore increasing self-carriage and collection ability.
Trot slowly downhill. This builds the back leg strength needed for jumping, and can actually help your horse jump higher and do better extensions. As an even harder workout, start out trotting downhill at a medium-slow trot, and then slow to a very collected trot. This exercise uses momentum to make it harder. Remember to only trot down slight to medium hills, never steep ones.
Trot along riverbeds, especially sandy ones. It is a lot of work to trot through sand, and so increases endurance as well as leg muscle.
Weave around trees. This helps build flexibility and can help your horse have a better all-around performance.
Trails are also a great place to practice turns. Try to stop him/her from over bending. Your horse will probably stay on the trail, especially if it is rimmed with trees, giving you the ability to ask for a lot of bend while he turns. This is a great stretch, and builds shoulder muscle as well.
Side-pass along turns. Most horses want to follow the trail, so if you keep their head straight and put your leg on, they should side-pass nicely, building lateral muscles simultaneously.
Trot and canter up medium hills to improve suspension. They will naturally trot and canter with a longer, loftier stride uphill, and so will increase fitness for doing the same on the flat.

,, You can:


Back up a lot. Don’t settle for two drags of his/her front feet, either. Marching backwards at a fairly good pace increases back and leg muscle, helping with self-carriage.
Practice stopping quickly in the corners. Trot briskly down the long side, and drive your horse into the wall, asking him/her to stop at the last moment, causing him/her to hold himself up as he stops. This improves collection and self-carriage.
Trot and canter over ground poles. Once your horse becomes good at negotiating first a few, and then several, you can set them up the whole length of the long side, about nine feet apart for canter work, and six for trot. This depends a lot on your horse’s stride, however, so adjust as necessary. Of course, they can also be used to help training collected and extended gaits, but increase the distance slowly.
Trot over cavaletti, otherwise known as raised ground poles. This does the same for your horse as ground poles, only it intensifies the effect. Never set up more than six in a row.
Stretch before each ride. This will prevent muscle injuries and will improve flexibility.
Jump! Jumping can improve fitness in any horse, no matter the discipline, and it is fun. Start low, and increase the height gradually.
Practice extreme collection in turns. Trot or canter quickly on the long side, and turn completely around at the last moment before the corner. Your horse will have to carry himself throughout these, building back muscle. Try doing this without breaking gait.
Side-pass over a ground pole. Walk onto the pole and side-pass along it until your horse side-passes off the pole. Try this at a collected trot, too. This helps them side-pass really straight, and builds a lot of muscle.

,,, Never let a horse sit in his stall all week and then ride him hard on the weekends.

, If they are wearing down faster because of the increased exercise, he might need different farrier care or a hoof supplement.

, Unless your horse is a hard keeper, do not feed much grain. Most horses only need enough grain to put their supplements on.

, It helps your horse to become quicker at stopping and turning.

, The goal of riding is to be a partner with your horse, not a dictator.

The horse will likely need a period of stall rest, and may not be able to handle anything more strenuous than a gentle walk on a lead line for some time after that.;
, Lunging, or handling the horse from the ground with a long line, is a great way to start exercising an out-of-shape horse lightly. It can also get the horse (re)-accustomed to your commands and body language, and is especially recommended for untrained horses. If the horse is only slightly out of shape, and already accustomed to being ridden, you may follow the steps below while riding the horse instead.


Lunging is also referred to as lounging.

, Walk the horse for about 10–20 minutes each day. Walk the horse forward, then turn in circles and figure eights, but give the horse space to make a wide arc while turning. If the horse is untrained, or acting uncooperative, focus on training the horse first. Once it responds to your commands, increase the speed to a fast walk (but not a trot) to increase the benefits of the exercise.


Vary the direction you are walking in and the turns you make, so the horse gets accustomed to following your lead instead of falling into a habitual pattern.

, Trot for the first time after a week of walking exercises. Start your exercise session with 5–10 minutes of walking, then have the horse trot for 5–10 minutes.

, The horse should pant a little after a trot, but should not be gasping for air, coughing, or excessively sweating. Some out-of-shape horses may be able to handle longer stretches of trotting, but keep a careful eye on them to avoid injury. Find a baseline for the amount of trotting your horse can sustain without major effort, but always start with walking, and keep your initial exercise sessions to a maximum of thirty minutes.

, After each trot, dismount (if applicable) and walk the horse gently for at least 15 minutes. You may instead let horse roam by itself in a pasture during this time. The important part is not returning the horse to its stall until it has cooled off from the exercise with this relaxed movement.

, Trotting is excellent for building muscle mass, but patient, gradual increases are the safest and most effective way to get the horse fit long-term. Every second or third exercise session, increase the amount of trotting by one or two minutes.

, A significantly out-of-shape horse will often require four weeks of exercise or more before improvements begin to show. Stay patient, and focus on the long-term benefits. Once the horse can easily handle 15 minutes of walking, followed by 15 minutes of trotting, continue to the next section below.


For the next section, you will need to start riding the horse, if you haven't already.

, Extend the length of the workout gradually, by no more than a few minutes each week. Use a ""walk, trot, walk, trot"" pattern to increase the length of the exercise session without wearing out the horse, but keep increasing the amount of time the horse trots each time as well.


Remember to always end an exercise session with a walk without a rider.

, Now that the exercise is beginning to expand beyond short, gentle sessions, make sure the horse gets sufficient rest. Give the horse a break from all forms of riding at least once a week.

, Trotting up and down hills is especially effective at building the horse's hindquarter muscles. Keep in mind that the horse may trot at a slower pace over hills.


Never ride up and down hills on muddy ground or other terrain with dangerous footing.

, Once the horse can trot for an hour without a break, it's time to try a light canter. Push the horse from a trot into a canter for just a moment, then back to a walk. Repeat this every day or every other day, gradually increasing the canter time every couple exercise sessions. It may be a few weeks before the horse can comfortably canter.


Adopt a jump seat position while cantering, to take most of your weight off the horse's back and to keep you balanced.
Cantering is good for developing the horse's breathing, but trotting is more effective as a general muscle workout.

, Don't push the horse to this step; it usually takes at least nine weeks for an out of shape horse to be ready for galloping. Once the horse can canter comfortably, move from a canter to a gallop, then back to a canter again. Try this once or twice a week, gradually increasing the amount of time spent galloping.

, If you are training the horse for competitions, understand that jumping does not need to happen every exercise session. At the start of a season, a few jumping exercises are useful to get the horse back in form. Apart from that, high jumping exercises are not recommended due to the stress on the horse's joints. Have the horse trot and jump over short obstacles instead, or use other exercises to build jumping muscles.


Useful exercises include leg yields, ""shoulder in"" exercises, and having the horse lengthen and shorten its stride.

, A veterinarian or horse feed seller may be able to advise you on a healthier brand of bagged grain, and/or a less fattening hay. If your horse is overweight, or if its ribs are showing, consult a veterinarian for advice on the horse's feeding schedule.


Keep in mind that a working (or exercising) horse needs more food than one that stays in a stall or pasture all day.
Do not give the horse diet or medical supplements without the advice of a veterinarian.

, If you feed your horse treats, cut back or switch to healthy alternatives. Carrots are healthy treats, while sugar cubes are not.

, Let the horse into a pasture for at least three hours a day, and preferably for six hours or longer. Roaming and grazing in an open space may boost the horse's energy level, reduce negative attitude, and even help its digestion and injury recovery speed.

Ask your feed dealer for a weight tape.,
Stand your horse on level ground.,
Stand on the horse's left side.,
Reach under your horse's belly with your free hand and pull it gently towards you.,
Read the number on the tape where it meets the ""zero"" end.",How to Use a Tape to Weigh a Horse1," A weight tape is marked in pounds instead of inches. It's made of soft, strong cloth. A weight tape estimates a horse's weight by measuring it's heart girth. The weight tape is best used for occasions where you don't need an exact weight.You can buy a weight tape from catalogs, but many feed dealers give them away for free. Tapes are an easy way to provide advertising for the dealer.
Weight tapes are sometimes printed on both sides. One side will list pounds, the other side will list the number of ""hands"". This side isn't necessary for the purpose of weighing a horse.
A weight tape provides a less accurate weight estimate than an ordinary tape measure. It may be as much as 100-200 pounds away from the horse's actual weight. If you need a more precise measurement, e.g. for a strong dewormer, consider using a tape measure instead.;
, Make sure the horse's head is relaxed, and that you have your weight tape with you.If the horse's head isn't relaxed, talk to him gently and wait until he relaxes. It's important that his head relax to get a more accurate weight.
You should also be relaxed. Take several deep breaths, and center yourself before starting to measure the horse.
Try to do this on a calm day, without much wind. Wind will make your task more difficult.

, Hold the tape end marked zero. Drape the weigh tape over the horse's back just behind his withers, or the small hump at the base of the neck.If the tape gets twisted, your reading won't be accurate. Be careful to smooth it down with your hands if it twists.
If your horse is young or easily spooked, having this tape draped across his back may provoke a nervous reaction. Stay calm, and stop moving the tape until the horse calms.

, You want the tape to be snug but not tight. Hold the tape beside the end of the tape in your hand (marked ""zero"").It's usually easier to hold the ""zero"" end of the tape still next to the horse's body while you pull the measuring tape up over it.
A helper can make this task a lot easier, especially if your horse is easily spooked.

, This is your horse's weight. For best results, repeat this process several times. Because your horse's body expands and contracts as he breathes, your measurement will be slightly different each time. Make sure your thumbs or fingers aren't beneath the tape when you read the measurement.
Weigh your horses regularly, to ensure best nutrition and health.

Measure your horse's heart girth.,
Pull the tape gently beneath the horse's belly.,
Measure your horse's length.,
Walk beside the horse holding the measuring tape.,
Notice if your measurement is in inches (English) or centimeters (metric).,
Multiply the measured heart girth x heart girth x length.",How to Use a Tape to Weigh a Horse2," Drape a standard soft measuring tape across your horse's back, as in the step above. Hold the tape at the ""zero"" end.The tape can be measured in feet and inches, or it can be measured in centimeters. The marking will affect the calculation that you do later in the process of determining your horse's weight.
This is best done out of the wind. Wind can cause the tape measure to flap and twist, making it harder to manage. A flapping tape can also spook a horse, resulting in a difficult measuring session.

, The tape should be a few inches behind the horse's front legs. Raise the tape to meet the tape held in your other hand, and read the measurement where the ""zero"" end of the tape meets the other side. Write the measurement down on a paper.You may notice that the tape runs at an angle from slightly behind the horse's front legs to the base of the withers. This is how it should be.
To make sure you have the most accurate measurement, repeat the measuring process.

, You will need a second person to help you hold the measuring tape. Position the other person on the right side of the horse. This person should hold the ""zero"" end of the tape measure at the point of the horse's shoulder.Don't stand too close to the horse's hind quarters, or he's likely to be spooked.
Make sure the second person is attentive and quiet.

, Pull the tape taut once you reach the point of the horse's buttock or crease.Make sure the tape isn't twisted as you pull it, or this may affect the accuracy of your measurement.
The second person might hold your notebook and pen for marking your measurements, leaving your hands free for holding the tape.

, You now have your horse's heart girth and length written on a paper. For example, your horse's heart girth might be 78 inches, and his length 65 inches. If you've measured in centimeters, heart girth might be 200 cm, length 165 cm. You'll need these to calculate your horse's weight.If your measurements are in centimeters, write down the number 11,990. Your weight will be in kilograms.
If your measurements are in inches, write down the number 330. Your weight will be in pounds.

, For example, if heart girth were 78 and length were 65 inches, multiply 78 x 78 x 65. You should arrive at the figure 395,460. When you have a total from the multiplication, divide this number by the number shown above.If you're measuring in centimeters, divide your total by 11,990. The result will be your horse's weight, in kilograms. Find the weight of a horse with heart girth 200 cm, length 165 cm by using this equation: 200 x 200 x 165 = 6,600,000. Divided by 11,990, the final number would be 550. That is your horse's weight.
If you're measuring in inches, divide your total by 330. The result will be your horse's weight, in pounds. So, using the example above, 78 x 78 x 65 = 395,460. Divided by 330, the final number would be 1,198. That's your horse's weight.

Review the scores.,
Figure out ways to improve the score.,
Discuss your horse's score with its veterinarian.",How to Do Condition Scoring for Horse Yearlings," It will need to be standing in order to be assessed properly. From a standing position you will be able to reach all the areas on the yearling's body that you need to feel.Make sure that you keep the yearling at ease while you are doing condition scoring. If you have a report with the horse, it is more likely to allow you touch the areas you need to. Consider giving it a treat or petting it how it likes to be petted while doing the scoring in order to keep it happy and cooperative.;
, Get a general impression of the horse's shape to begin with. You are looking for areas on the body that seem out of proportion or are noticeably thin or thick. You will need to look at the horse from all directions: the front, the back, and the sides.This overview will allow you to get a general sense of the condition of the horse. Having a general understanding of the horse will help you move forward through your assessment.

, The condition scoring system was designed to take information from six key areas of the horse's body: the neck, the withers, the loin, the ribs, the shoulder, and at the top of the tail. Looking at these specific areas will allow you to assess how much fat the horse is carrying.The condition scoring is based on how much of the horse's bones you can see and feel in these areas.
You will need to look at each of these areas and make a determination about how much of the animals bones can you see through the coat. If the bones are sticking out a lot, then the horse is too thin. If the bones are not visible, then the horse is carrying too much fat.

, In addition to looking at the horse's body, you will need to feel it to determine how much fat is being held under the skin. Like with the visual inspection, this should be done at the six key points: the neck, the withers, the loin, the ribs, the shoulder, and at the tail.Feel each of these spots on the horse to assess how easily you can feel the bones underneath.


For example, if you can really easily feel the ribs, then the horse is too thin. If there is a crease down the yearling's back, then it is probably overweight.If the condition scoring is done in the winter, the yearling may have its winter coat on, which may make the horse look and feel different from other times of year. Take this into consideration when condition scoring. It is often the case that a thick winter coat can hide the fact that a horse is too thin.

, This is a chart that allows you to fill in a score for each area of the yearling's body that you assess. It usually includes parameters for what each score would look and feel like on the horse.


For example, it will give a description of what you might feel and how much that would score.In the case of the yearling's ribs, if you can't see the ribs but can feel them easily, that would be a score of five, which is ideal.
To get a scorecard, do an online search for ""horse condition scoring scorecard."" Once you find one, you can download and print it for your own use.

, When feeling each area on the yearling's body you will need to assign a numerical score. This numerical score, between one and nine, is directly connected to how much you can feel the animal's bones through its coat.


Under the body conditioning system, one is used for extremely thin and nine is used for extremely overweight. In between those numbers are various parameters for differentiating between levels of thinness and thickness. For example, a horse who has ribs that are protruding prominently should get a rib score of one. A horse that has ribs that can't be seen but can be easily felt should get a score of 5., Look at all the scores for all areas of the body. These are your horse's body conditioning scores. For a healthy yearling, you expect the score in each category to be somewhere between five and seven.


If the score is higher than seven or lower than five, then you should work on changing the amount of fat your horse is carrying around on its body.

, There are a variety of ways to change your horse's body condition. This depends on if your horse has too much fat or too little fat.


If the horse does not have enough fat then you need to feed it more, feed it food that gives it more nutrition, work it less, or keep it warmer. Many times a horse that is cold in the winter will lose too much weight because of it. Simply putting a blanket on it or adding to its shelter can help it gain weight.
If the horse has too much fat then you should reduce the amount it is eating and consider working it more. However, if you reduce its feed, still make sure it is getting enough nutrients to sustain it.

, Whether your horse's score is good or needs improvement, it's a good idea to discuss it with the horse's veterinarian. If the score is good, tell your veterinarian so they know the good news. If the score is not good, discuss ways to improve it with the horse's veterinarian.


If your horse's score is good, you can wait until its next exam to tell the veterinarian the good news. If the score is bad, you should contact your veterinarian right away to begin helping your horse improve its health.

Try hot tubbing to treat lower limb lameness.,
Use hot fomentation to treat abscesses and infection higher up on the leg.,
Apply a poultice to reduce swelling after exercise.",How to Treat Lameness in Horses1," Box rest is the mainstay of lameness treatment for many horses. Depending on the nature of the lameness, horses may need rest for anywhere from a few days for a simple sprain, to weeks or even months for a more serious injury.


Rest places less demands on an injured joint surface, where continued use would provoke further inflammation. Continuing to work a lame horse can potentially cause further physical damage, such as chip the inflamed cartilage lining to a join, and cause permanent harm.
Also, working a lame horse provokes the release of further prostaglandins and hence worsens inflammation. By resting the horse you attempt to break this vicious circle.;
, Cold hosing is a simple form of hydrotherapy employed to reduce swelling in a limb It involves running cool water from a garden hose over the lame leg. This is usually done for 20 minutes once or twice a day. The principle is that the cold water removes the heat associated with swelling, while the water flow massages the tissue and helps disperse fluid build-up.


Ideally, the water temperature should be very cold. The advantage of hosing is that the temperature remains constant and does not warm up (as with an ice pack). 20 minutes sessions are ideal because this is enough time to disperse heat, but is not enough time for the cold to compromise blood circulation to the limb.
It is a good idea to smear Vaseline or grease over the horse's heel prior to hosing. This prevents the tissue of the heel becoming softened by the constant stream of water which could predispose it to cracking and infection.
Unless your horse is very well-mannered, hosing is a two person job – one to hose and one to steady the horse. Depending on the nature of the injury your veterinarian will advise on how many days to continue hosing after the swelling has resolved.

, Hot tubbing is used to treat lower limb lameness where the cause is a suspected abscess or a foreign body in the hoof, because hot tubbing softens tissues and helps to draw infection out. It involves immersing the foot in a bucket of hot 100°F (38°C) water containing Epsom salts to soften the sole of the foot and allow infection to drain.


Always clean the hoof thoroughly before immersing in the clean water. If necessary use a hoof pick to clean the sole and frog, and wash the hoof in water ahead of tubbing. It is a good idea to remove the bucket handle to prevent the leg from accidentally getting trapped between the handle and bucket.
Fill the bucket with hot water and add a cupful of Epsom salts. Stand the horse's leg into the bucket and keep it there for 15 to 20 minutes. As the water cools over time, remove the foot while you top the bucket up with hot water. After soaking for 20 minutes, place the hoof on a clean towel and dry it well. This procedure can be repeated 3 to 4 times daily.

, Fomentation has a similar indication as for tubbing (suspected infections, or abscesses), but is used on higher areas of the leg which are not practical to immerse in a bucket.


To apply a hot fomentation, soak a clean towel in hot water and Epsom salts and wrap it around the swollen or inflamed part of the leg. Place a second towel in the bucket of water and Epsom salts.
When the towel that is wrapped around the leg cools, replace it with the waiting hot one from the bucket. Use hot fomentation in 15 to 20 minute sessions, 3 to 4 times daily.

, Poultices have a number of applications in that they can reduce swelling after hard exercise and draw out infection from an abscess. Traditionally bran poultices were popular, but with the advent of many excellent commercial poultices, (such as Animalintex) the need for messy home-prepared poultices has dropped off.


Commercial poultices come as an impregnated sheet with a shiny side (face this away from the animal) and an absorbent side (applied to the injury). First cut your poultice to the desired size so that the injured area is completely covered. It can be used dry (great for reducing swelling) or wet (to draw out infection). Both methods are applied in the same way, but when using a wet poultice the precut material is soaked in hot water first, and allowed to cool to 100°F.
The poultice is placed against the injury or swelling and held in place with a dressing such as Vetwrap self-adhesive bandage. Enough tension is applied to the bandage to stop it from slipping down, but not so much as to cut off the circulation to the limb.
A poultice should never be left on for more than 12 hours, and it is preferable to change them 2 or 3 times daily.

Move your horse to a dry, clean area.,
Trim the frog of the hoof.,
Clean out the hoof.,
Use an antiseptic to clean the affected area.,
Consider using thrush medication.,
Use a bar shoe after the thrush has healed.,
Recognize the appearance of thrush.,
Look for signs of pain.,
Have an equine veterinarian evaluate your horse.,
Give your horse some dry footing.,
Keep the hooves clean, trimmed, and shod.,
Exercise your horse regularly.",How to Treat Hoof Thrush," The first step in treating thrush is to remove your horse from the environment in which thrush tends to flourish. If you keep your horse in a wet or dirty environment the thrush is likely to return, no matter what treatment options you employ.Thrush is usually developed on damp or dirty ground, whether in a stable or a field.
Clean out urine and manure on a daily basis. Bodily wastes can be a big contributing factor in developing thrush.Try spreading gravel on the ground. This will allow your horse to keep its hooves dry, even if the floor of the stable or paddock is damp.;
, Once your horse is in a clean, dry area, you'll need to have the frog trimmed on your horse's hoof or hooves. If you do not know how to trim the frog by yourself, have a trusted farrier or equine veterinarian trim the frog for you. This will get rid of the affected area and permit better air circulation across the hoof, improving the chances that the thrush will not return., Once the affected part of the frog is removed, you're ready to clean the hoof. Cleaning the hoof should become a daily part of your horse maintenance going forward, as it will help prevent injury and reduce the chances of thrush returning in the future. Be careful, though, as the horse may be in considerable pain, and cleaning out its affected hoof may frighten or anger your horse.Use a hoof pick to pick out any larger debris from the affected area.Twist a clean piece of gauze into a rope-like shape and use it to floss out any residual debris lodged in the hoof.
Use a mild soap and clean water to scrub the hooves.

, Now that you've removed the visible dirt and debris from your horse's hooves, you'll want to clean the affected area(s) with an antiseptic solution.Some horse experts recommend treating thrush with iodine.Others suggest treating thrush with bleach. However, it's worth noting that harsh chemicals can dry out your horse's hooves, which may make them prone to further injuries and afflictions.

, Some experts recommend using thrush medication in addition to cleaning the hoof and trimming the frog.This can help give your horse relief from the symptoms of thrush and combat the bacterial infection while your horse heals. If you're unsure about whether or not to try medication, talk to your equine veterinarian about the benefits of adding thrush medication to your treatment plan.


If you decide to use thrush medication, squirt it into the sulcus of the hoof.
Apply clean gauze or cotton balls to the sulcus to cover the medication. Use a hoof pick to pack the gauze as deeply as possible into the sulcus.
Change the packing every day for one to two weeks.The only times you should not have any medication or packing on the sulcus is during exercise or riding sessions.
Depending on the severity of the infection, it could potentially take several months for the hoof to completely heal. Be patient and keep the hooves clean and cared for.

, If you were previously using a standard horseshoe or no shoe at all on your horse's hooves, you may want to consider switching to a bar shoe once the affliction has healed. In some cases, using a bar shoe has helped the frog regenerate after being trimmed and treated.A bar shoe is a horseshoe with joined heals. It forms a continuous loop, usually made of either aluminum or steel.Bar shoes can help improve ground contact, protect the hoof, and stabilize the overall foot.

, Thrush will appear as a black, tar-like discharge that emerges from your horse's hoof. A horse's hoof afflicted with thrush may appear to have deeper than normal grooves (sulcus) along the sides of the hoof's frog.The affected part of the hoof will most likely have a foul odor, which is one of the most common characteristics of thrush., You can usually tell when a horse has hoof thrush based on the way it walks and reacts when you clean the hoof. A horse afflicted with thrush will show pain whenever pressure is applied to the area, which may result in limping or even lameness in severe cases.In really advanced cases of thrush, the lower limb may swell up in response to the infection. If this happens, you will need to treat the thrush aggressively to ensure that your horse can fully recover.
The hind hooves tend to be more afflicted with thrush than the front hooves. However, the front hooves can still contract thrush, and should be thoroughly examined and cleaned any time you suspect there might be a case of thrush.

, With proper care and environmental changes, most cases of thrush clear up in one to two weeks. However, if the thrush has been a chronic problem, or if the infection has progressed to the deeper tissues in the hoof or leg, there could be permanent damage. The best way to evaluate how extensive your horse's thrush is would be to consult a veterinarian who specializes in horse care., Wet and/or dirty footing is one of the leading causes of hoof thrush in horses. If you keep your horse outside in an enclosure and the ground is constantly wet, let your horse come into a barn or stable stall from time to time to allow the hooves to dry out. You should also keep the stable and paddocks clean and as dry as possible.Muck out manure from the stalls and hose down urine on a daily basis.
Spread gravel in the paddocks or on the floor of the stable so that your horse can stand on dry footing, even when the ground underneath is wet.
You can use wood chips, but make sure you don't use conifers or other highly-acidic wood. As the wood chips from these trees get wet and begin to decompose they can raise the pH of the environment, which may promote bacterial growth.

, In addition to keeping a clean, dry environment, you should also make sure your horse's hooves are well-trimmed and shod. This can help prevent long heel conformation from forming, and it will help ensure a healthy frog.If you do not know how to trim a hoof, do not attempt to do it on your own. Hire a reputable farrier or have your equine veterinarian help you with your horse's hooves.

, Regular exercise can help prevent thrush in horses. That's because movement expands and contracts the hooves, which can push debris out of the grooves in the hooves. Even if you can't turn out your horse in an enclosure, hand walking your horse or going for a ride on dry ground can significantly reduce the chances of thrush developing."

Weigh your horse.,
Estimate your horse’s weight.,
Determine your horse’s condition.,
Work with your veterinarian.,
Consider your horse’s lifestyle.,
Feed your horse by weight.",How to Maintain Healthy Weight for a Horse1," The most accurate way to determine your horse’s weight is to use a scale. Obviously, though, most people don’t own a set of scales designed for large livestock. You may be able to weigh your horse at your veterinarian’s office, or you may be able to have a local feed store lend you their scales.If you own a lot of horses, it may be worth investing in a set of horse scales. These usually cost around 3,000 USD.;
, If you don’t have access to a set of scales, or if you want to calculate your horse’s weight in-between weighing, you can also use an equation that calculates the horse’s weight based on their body measurements. If you are using the metric system, your measurements should be done in centimeters. If you are using the imperial system you should take the measurements in inches.To do this, take your horse’s heart girth measurement just behind the horse’s elbow. Lay the tape so it is about an inch behind the top of the withers and pass it underneath the horse so that it lines up just behind the elbow.
You will also need to measure your horse’s length by starting at the tip of the shoulder (just below the neck) and ending at the tip of the buttock. If you feel the horse’s buttock carefully, you will feel a bony point. This is where the tape measure should stop.
Use this equation to get your horse’s weight in kilograms: Weight (kg)=(heart girth in cm * heart girth in cm * body length)/11,990. For example, if your horse’s heart girth is 195 cm and it’s length is 183 cm, the equation would look like this: (195*195*183)/11,990 = 580. Thus, your horse’s estimated weight is 580 kilograms.
If you want your horse’s weight in pounds, use this equation: Weight (lbs)=(heart girth in inches * heart girth in inches* body length)/330. For example, if your horse’s heart girth is 77 inches and it’s length is 71 inches, the equation would look like this: (77*77*71)/330 = 1,276. Thus, the estimated weight of your horse is 1,276 pounds.
You can also use a weight tape that measures the weight of your horse based on their heart girth. When you wrap this tape around the horse’s body at the heart girth, you will find the weight printed directly on the tape.

, Though it is good to know your horse’s weight, it won’t necessarily give you an indication of whether your horse is too fat or too thin. To determine this, you need to look at your horse’s “condition.” There are several ways that this can be done, but the most common system is known as the “Henneke Body Conditioning Score” or “BCS.”This scoring system uses a 1 to 9 system where a 1 refers to a horse that is extremely emaciated and 9 refers to a horse that is extremely obese. A horse that is a 5 would be considered to be in good condition.
To use this system examine the amount of fat present on the loins and tailhead, ribs, elbow, shoulder, withers, and neck area. In each area, a horse that is in good condition will not have visible bones, but these bones can be easily felt when you touch them. For example on a well-conditioned horse, you shouldn’t be able to see the ribs, but you should be able to feel them easily if you run your hand along the ribcage.

, Though you can determine your horse’s weight and condition on your own, it is a good idea to involve your veterinarian in the process. A veterinarian is trained to keep your animal as healthy as possible, and they may have advice on what will be a healthy weight and condition for your horse.


For example, some breeds may not be able to be scored as accurately using the BCS, so your veterinarian might make other suggestions about how to measure condition.
You might ask your vet, “Does my horse’s breed tend to gain or lose weight easily?”, “Are there any tips you can give me about how to keep my horse in its optimal condition?”, “How often should I be weighing and checking my horse’s condition?”
Your vet can also show you Henneke scoring and teach you how to score your horses properly.

, When figuring out how much to feed your horse, it is important to consider the kind of lifestyle your horse needs. A racehorse will obviously need more feed than a horse simply kept for pleasure.For example, a horse that you keep purely for pleasure probably doesn’t need any grain. Instead, this horse just needs enough access to roughage.

, For convenience reasons, many horse owners feed their horse by volume rather than by weight. Unfortunately, though, this means that your horse could be getting a lot more (or a lot less) feed than they need. The most accurate way to feed your horse is to weigh their feed.Generally speaking, a horse should eat 2 to 2.5 lbs (0.9 to 1.15 kilos) of feed each day per 100 pounds (45 kilos) of body weight. However, this is just a rule of thumb, an older horse may need to eat more to keep weight on. Very active horses might eat significantly more than this. This is why it is important to discuss feed with your veterinarian.
If you feed your horse grain, you can start out by weighing it and then dumping it into whatever you want to use to measure out their feed on a daily basis. Mark this feed container based on how much weighed grain is inside, and then you can simply fill the container up to the right place each day. Remember to re-do this process if you switch to a different type of feed that likely has a different weight.

Determine if your horse has difficulty eating.,
Spot sloppy eating to identify oral pain.,
Look for signs of choking.Oral pain makes the horse less willing to chew, and makes it more likely to swallow food that is incompletely broken down and only partially mixed with saliva.,
Notice if your horse has puffy cheeks from packing balls of grass or hay.,
See if your horse avoids a bit, the piece of horse tack that goes in the mouth.A horse with a sore mouth is likely to be uncomfortable with a bit in her mouth.,
Weigh your horse.,
Keep an eye out for signs of indigestion and colic.,
Look for whole pieces of food in your horse's droppings.,
Smell your horse's breath to see if is worse than usual.,
Gag the horse to make sure its mouth stays open during examination.,
Examine the problem teeth with a speculum to confirm the diagnosis.,
Inspect your horse's mouth regularly to keep an eye on symptoms.",How to Tell If a Horse Needs Teeth Floated," Dental spurs in your horse's mouth may dig into the buccal (cheek) or lingual (tongue) surface and cause pain. This indicates that your horse needs its teeth floated.The horse may be hesitant to eat or eat less than it usually eats.
The horse may take a long time to eat, and throw its head as it eats.
The horse may also exhibit other signs that it is not eating enough, such as losing weight.;
, Your horse may become an untidy eater, slobbering and dropping food out of its mouth.For example, determine if your horse has scattered food all over the stable floor.


Some horses will hold their head to one side as they chew, leading to heavy drooling. See if your horse has a constantly wet chin, from dribbling. They dribble because swallowing involves movement of the tongue, which can be painful due to the spurs. Instead of swallowing, they would rather drool.
Sometimes the saliva is blood stained because of the damage to the mucous membrane lining the mouth.

, These dry balls of food can get stuck in the esophagus (the tube connecting the mouth to the stomach) and cause your horse to choke. This creates a visible lump in the left side of the neck, in a line from the esophagus, which travels from the corner of the jawbone to the point of the shoulder.


This is not the immediate emergency that choking in humans is. This does not block the trachea, so the horse can still breath. However, the food blockage will build up over time, causing the horse to cough up fluid and food, in addition to causing discomfort and pain.If the esophagus is blocked with a ball of hay, the saliva has nowhere to go when the horse swallows and so the horse tends to drool heavily.

, When a horse works out a way to pack balls of hay or grass between the cheek and teeth, to act as a pad or barrier, it is called quidding.This cushions the cheek lining as they chew and reduces discomfort.


This can been seen if your horse has ""hamster"" or puffy cheeks.
Your horse will also spit these balls out onto the stable floor occasionally, which is a sign that its teeth need floating.

, This is because when the bit comes in contact with the sore in its mouth, the horse tries to protect it by shifting the bit to a different place where it is less painful. Thus the horse becomes preoccupied with avoiding the bit and either throws its head around, or flexes its neck to try to drop the bit out.


This can transform a usually placid and well-behaved animal, into one who tosses its head around when ridden, or tries to avoid the bit by over-bending its neck.

, A horse in need of dental attention may lose weight. This is because the horse will learn to selectively eat foods that require less chewing. Your horse may avoid coarse hay and hard grains, and prefer to eat gruel or soft grass.Another reason the horse may lose weight is that she is not grinding the food thoroughly. Grinding breaks down cell walls and fiber making it easier to for the gut to digest the food and get maximum nutritional value.
Pay attention if your horse looks very thin or starved. If your horse's mouth is particularly painful, then it may only eat the bare minimum, or even starve itself rather than experience discomfort.
The horse may also be more lethargic than usual, due to a lack of food energy.

, Balls of under-chewed food can make it to the stomach, but lodge in the gut and cause indigestion or colic. The symptoms of this include abdominal discomfort, which manifests as restlessness, constant turning, and looking at their flank, kicking at their belly, rapid shallow breathing, general agitation, wide-staring eyes, and flared nostrils., Because the dental spurs cause pain and result in less thorough chewing, your horse will swallow more full pieces of food. This poorly chewed food includes larger pieces of hay, and complete pieces of grain, which the gut is unable to fully breakdown and digest. Therefore, the horse's dung will contain whole pieces of cereal or grain, and pieces of undigested hay., If your horse has dental spurs, food is more likely to become trapped in the mouth. This food then becomes rancid and starts to smell.


Also, the sores or ulcers in the mouth can become infected and result in bad breath (halitosis).

, Direct examination of the teeth involves putting a special gag into the horse's mouth so that the mouth is held in a semi-open position. This prevents the horse form chewing the speculum when it is introduced, and allows all planes of the teeth to be inspected., The problem teeth are the molars, or grinding teeth, which are situated at the back of the mouth. These are too far back to see without the aid of a special oral speculum. This is not painful and most horses tolerate this very well.The oral speculum is a torch-like instrument with a flat, rounded edged blade that can be slid into the mouth for the purposes of examining the teeth.
A vet or equine dental technician has access to such a speculum.
If the horse is liable to toss its head around then it may be wise to put a halter on and tie the lead rope with her head in a slightly elevated position, in order to restrict her movement and allow better inspection of the mouth.

, Provided you do not see any signs of oral discomfort, a once per year inspection for horses between 5-20 years of age is fine. If your horse is under the care of a veterinarian, have him or her assess your horse's teeth.Under 5 years old the horse is still growing, and a more frequent checkups are needed to make sure that teeth have come away cleanly and the dental arches are lined up.
Likewise, after 20 years of age the horse is more likely to start getting dental complications, such as a cracked crowns or a tooth root infection, so twice per year dental checks are appropriate.

, An abscess infection can generate a lot of heat in and around your horse's hoof. Feel around the top of the hoof, being sure to also assess any associated swelling or discomfort your horse is feeling., Some horse owners will wait for an abscess to rupture on its own, rather than getting veterinary treatment. This is not humane, as the abscess causes the horse extreme pain.Instead, once you notice a problem you should get it treated by a professional immediately.

, An abscess in your horse's hoof can be difficult to identify and treat effectively on your own. That is why it is a good idea to get the medical expertise of a veterinarian that is used to treating horses if you suspect an abscess.


When you call to make an appointment be sure to tell the veterinarian what your horse's symptoms are, when they developed, and what you suspect is going on. This will help the vet decide whether your horse needs immediate treatment.

, First, your veterinarian will probably make a general assessment of the horses health and will look at its gait. Then, he or she will take a closer look at the horse's hooves. Your veterinarian may even use hoof tools to trim the hoof so that he or she can identify problem area.Before trimming the hoof, your veterinarian should also clean the hoof. This will allow them to assess where to trim, as well as generally giving the vet a better view at the hoof.

, In order to get rid of the infection, the abscess will need to be drained.Your veterinarian will need to make a hole at the edge of the hoof to establish this drainage. The vet can do this with sterile instruments in a sterile environment that will promote the healing process.


Draining an abscess should not happen through the bottom of the sole. Instead, the drain should be established at the junction between the sole and the hard outer wall of the hoof.
Draining the abscess should give your horse some immediate relief.

, Give any medications that your veterinarian prescribes. This can include a painkiller that will also reduce inflammation, such as a NSAID.Your veterinarian is likely to stress the importance of keeping the injured area clean, which means also keeping the horse's living quarters clean.


It's important to keep the wound clean until it has healed, which usually takes a week or so.
Your veterinarian may also suggest an hoof soak to promote draining. This should only be done on the advice of a veterinarian, as excessive soaking can weaken the hoof., The medication on the bandage will keep the abscess draining for a few days. You should understand how to apply a new bandage, as it will need to be changed every day until the injury is healed.If the bandage begins to come off, be sure to reapply it.

, While your horse is healing you should keep a look out for signs that the infection is not healing or developing further.Signs of a problem that requires veterinary attention include:


Increase in drainage or drainage lasting more than two days
Continuing signs of pain after two days
Loss of appetite
Flesh growing out of drainage hole

Use pain relieving medications to help with lameness.,
Give your horse aspirin for mild pain.,
Use phenylbutazone to reduce pain and fever.,
Get a prescription for flunixin to reduce pain and inflammation.,
Be aware of the possible side effects of NSAIDs.",How to Treat Lameness in Horses2," Pain relief has an important role to play in the treatment of lameness. Modern painkillers (analgesics) have a dual action of reducing pain and inflammation, and belong to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory group of drugs (NSAIDS).


NSAIDs work by inhibiting the action of cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX1 and COX2). It is the COX enzymes that release prostaglandins that cause inflammation and pain. By blocking COX enzymes the mediators of inflammation (prostaglandins) are reduced and so pain is reduced.
The most commonly used NSAID pharmaceuticals for the relief of bone and joint problems in the horse are aspirin, flunixin, and phenylbutazone.

, Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is effective against mild pain, swelling, and discomfort. Some aspirin products are available over the counter from pharmacies which makes them a useful first option treatment for mild lameness.AniPrin contains powdered acetylsalicylic acid mixed with a palatable molasses flavor base, designed to be mixed into the horse's feed. The dose is 10mg/kg once daily.
For a 500kg horse this equates to 5,000mg (or 5 grams) of AniPrin. Two scoops are supplied with the product: the larger measures out 28.35grams, and the smaller 3.75grams. Thus, a typical 500kg horse requires 1.5 small scoops of AniPrin once daily on food.
Never give aspirin to a horse that is taking other medications without first consulting your vet, and always provide a plentiful supply of fresh water.

, Commonly known as ""bute"" amongst horse owners, phenylbutazone reduces pain and fever. Phenylbutazone is a prescription NSAID and needs to be prescribed by your vet. It should not be used in combination with other NSAIDs, steroids, or given on an empty stomach.


Phenylbutazone interacts with some medications (such as phenytoin, sulfonamides, warfarin, barbiturates, and digoxin) so always speak to your vet before starting treatment.A typical equine preparation is of phenylbutazone is Butazolidin. The dose for a 454kg horse is 2 to 4grams once a day with or after food. It is available as 1gram tablets, an oral paste, or an oral powder containing 1g of phenylbutazone in a 10gram sachet. The manufacturer advises not to exceed 4g rams a day, and to administer the lowest effective dose where possible.

, Flunixin is another prescription NSAID, sold commercially as Banamin.


Banamin is a potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor which inhibits prostaglandin and therefore brings down inflammation. It is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine, and each dose works for 24 to 30 hours.
The dose of Banamin is 1.1mg/kg once daily by mouth. Therefore, a 500kg horse requires 550 mg (0.5g), which is equivalent to one 20g sachet which contains 500mg of flunixin.

, NSAIDS can reduce the blood supply to the stomach and kidneys. While this should not be significant in healthy, well-hydrated horses (especially when the medication is given with food), NSAIDs should never be given to dehydrated animals because this could concentrate the drug and amplify its damaging effects on the kidney.


Other side effects of NSAIDs include gastric ulceration and possible worsening of pre-existing kidney disease. This can manifest itself as a loss of appetite, and increased thirst. The treatment involves stopping NSAID medications and giving drugs such as activated charcoal in order to protect the stomach lining.
A horse diagnosed with renal disease may need intravenous fluid therapy to flush the accumulation of naturally occurring toxins that the kidney has not got rid of out of the system.

Try to understand why your horse is thin.,
Make sure your horse has plenty of access to forage.,
Add fat to your horse’s diet.",How to Maintain Healthy Weight for a Horse2," If your horse is too thin, there are a variety of reasons that they may not gain weight easily. Not all of the reasons are due to the horse's health either. Just like humans, some horses have faster metabolism than others, and thus, have a hard time keeping on weight.Have your horse examined by a veterinarian, especially if they seem to have lost weight recently for no obvious reason. They may be able to point to an underlying cause of the weight loss or with difficulty putting on weight.
Be sure to get your horse regular dental checks, too. The horse should have its teeth floated at least once a year to avoid sharp points and keep it comfortable. Horses with mouth sores are less likely to eat and may lose weight.

, This should be the main piece of any horse’s diet and can be provided in the form of hay, pasture, or a legume feed. High-quality forage is imperative for the digestive health of your horse.Increasing the amount of quality of forage in a horse’s diet is often the first step in helping your horse gain weight.
A horse that lives on forage alone often eats 2 or 3% of their body weight in forage each day.

, If your horse doesn’t seem to be gaining the weight needed after changes in forage, consider adding more fat to their diet. Typically, this can be done by adding oil to their diets. Be sure to add oil in gradually so as not to upset the horse’s digestive system.Many experts recommend starting with a one-quarter cup of oil per feed and increasing this amount gradually up to a maximum of one cup of oil per feeding.
Good fat sources include corn, soybean, and rice bran.

Reduce the amount of grain in your horse's diet.,
Make sure your horse gets enough exercise.,
Limit your horse’s access to new spring grass.,
Help your horse eat slower.",How to Maintain Healthy Weight for a Horse3," If your horse is overweight, the first step is to reduce or remove grain from your horse’s diet. A horse that is not very active can often do well on good quality forage alone.If you do want to feed grain to your horse, try to avoid grains containing corn, molasses, or high starch levels, and opt for grains with less than 3.5% fat.

, Just like humans, horses need exercise to stay healthy. There are many ways to exercise your horse. You can allow your horse more time in the pasture and you can also spend time riding them to keep them in shape.Make sure that you warm your horse up well before exercise. This will reduce the chance of injury.
If you don’t have time to ride every day, consider longing your horse on a 20-meter line. This is an easy way to exercise your horse from the ground.
Don’t assume that your horse is getting enough exercise just because he’s turned out. Most horses aren’t “self-exercising” and need to be worked out during the day to burn energy.
Don’t overdo it, though. Remember that an overworked horse is at risk of injury and disease.

, In the spring, the grass is highest in fructans, which are difficult for your horse to digest. Thus, it is important to adjust your horse to this grass slowly whether or not the horse is overweight.If you want your horse to lose weight, however, you should restrict your horse’s access to this grass between 12pm and 6pm. This is when spring grass is highest in sugar and carbohydrates.

, One way to help your horse lose weight is to help them eat slower. If your horse eats slower, it will likely eat less. One way to do this is by double-bagging hay nets. This will make it more difficult for your horse to get the hay, forcing it to eat slower.You can also feed your horse more frequently, but in smaller portions. This will help keep your horse from overeating.
Feeding your horse slower will also keep it occupied. This will help keep the horse from getting bored and developing bad habits.

, They may calm down when they know a human is nearby to help.

, If you can't access the door, climb over a wall, and calm your horse down.

, Is it just the wall? Are there mangers and water bowls in the way? Remove them if you can and stand back to give the horse room to try to stand. If there are no fixtures above the horse:


String a rope, or lead shank around the back foot that is closest to the ground.
Give a heavy heave, rolling your horse over.
Immediately get out of the way to allow the horse to stand.

, Unless it’s a pony you may need help.Immediately get out of the way to allow the horse to stand. Don’t panic if the horse doesn’t stand up immediately. He may have been struggling for a while and be tired. Encourage him to stand. If he still won’t, call the vet.

, When you and the horse have calmed down, walk and trot him in hand to check for lameness. If possible, turn him out to allow him to stretch and relax. If you can’t, give him a good rub down to massage his muscles. When in doubt, call the vet.

Check the horse.,
Check for the manner in which the horse moves in the stall/field.,
See if there is there anything obviously wrong from a close physical inspection.,
Palpate the horse's legs.,
Hand walk the horse and observe how it moves.",How to Tell if Your Horse's Legs Are Hurt," Is it bearing weight evenly on all four limbs? Painful limbs will commonly be held off the ground (non-weight bearing) or be held slightly in front of the opposite limb (pointing)., Is its gait normal and it is advancing and bearing weight normally on all limbs? Is it bucking or shying away from pressure?

, If you see scratches, swellings, lacerations, etc. take a closer look and consider calling your veterinarian.

, Pay attention to heat or a painful reaction to your touch. Check for symmetry and smaller lesions that you may not have seen earlier.

, If it is clearly lame, call your veterinarian. If the horse looks sound, trot the horse in hand and observe. Lameness is not evident at the walk, but you will notice them at the trot. Horses are good at hiding their injuries and lameness may be subtle, so observe the horse moving from several different angles. Get someone else to trot the horse for you if necessary. Again, if the horse appears lame, call your veterinarian.

Clean your horse's legs regularly.,
Look for causes of mud fever.,
Check your horse for symptoms.,
Prepare your horse for treatment.,
Pick away the scabs.,
Clean the legs.,
Know when to get medical attention.,
Treat any infection and causes of infection.,
Determine why treatment might not have worked.",How to Rid Your Horse of Mud Fever," Look at your horse's legs every day for any signs of irritation or scabbing. If you notice irritated skin or scabs, clean the legs with a good quality soap, like a chlorhexidine scrub preparation. Rinse your horse's legs and apply enough of the chlorhexidine to cover the area. Gently wash the legs and rinse off the cleanser.Avoid applying too many different mud fever products, which may make it harder for your veterinarian to diagnose your horse's condition. Many of these products are for prevention of mud fever, and work by moisturizing the skin or providing a barrier to dampness. Once you notice signs of mud fever, they are ineffective and medicated treatment is necessary.;
, Mud fever is a ""secondary condition"" caused by another issue, like skin weakened by constant wetting, that creates bacterial or fungal infection.These primary causes can include bacterial infection due to wet folds in the skin, fungus, mites, minor skin injuries and can also be autoimmune related (where the horse's immune system is attacking itself). If it's autoimmune related (which is rare), redness, inflammation, sores, and itching weaken the skin and allow bacteria to invade, leading to mud fever.


Your horse's skin normally has bacteria on the surface that doesn't cause problems unless the skin's surface is damaged or the immune system is compromised and can't deal with infection.
Constant wetness (such as standing in mud beside a gate) causes the skin to become soft and swollen, which weakens natural defences.

, You'll often notice that areas in frequent contact with mud show signs of the disease. It usually affects the back of the heels and the fetlocks, but mud fever can extend up the back of the legs, because mud can splash when walking over extremely heavy, moist ground. Look for the following symptoms:Scabs with moist lesions underneath
Swollen limbs
Thick white, yellow or green discharge that smells bad
Painful cracked skin
Possible lameness
Fatigue and loss of appetite (in severe cases and in addition to the symptoms above)

, Get your horse in out of the wet conditions and clip the hair away from the back of the heels. This will let you remove mud and apply ointments to treat the skin. Use fine clipper blades to clip the hair right down to the skin. This will also let you check the area for new scabs and monitor the healing of existing scabs.


You may want to stable the horse for a few weeks on clean dry straw, move him onto dry pasture, or improve the drainage system in the existing pasture.

, Soften the scabs by soaking them in baby oil, using a cold poultice, or applying a moisturizing cream. If using a cream or oil, cover the area with a loose wrap of clingfilm and let the scabs soften over a period of 1 to 3 days. Change the clingfilm every day and reapply the emollients. Once the scabs are softened, pick them away until they're completely removed.You'll need to completely remove all of the scabs in order to remove the bacteria which causes the disease.

, You should see open sores on the lower limbs after you remove the scabs. Disinfect and dry the areas by wetting the legs thoroughly with warm water. Work a disinfectant, like a chlorhexidine solution, into the area and let it sit for 10 minutes. This will give the solution a chance to kill the bacteria. Rinse the area until it's no longer soapy and the water runs clear. Use soft, disposable paper towels to dry the legs and repeat this process twice a day.


Avoid drying your horse's legs with a terry cloth or cotton towel. Using a towel can reintroduce the infection.

, If you're having trouble removing the scabs, even after softening the scabs for days, call your veterinarian. Otherwise, you may be causing your horse pain by trying to remove the scabs yourself. You should also call the vet if you're having trouble keeping the affected area clean. The vet will take samples of the affected area and test for the exact cause of the problem.


Since many things can cause mud fever, a correct diagnosis can determine the most effective treatment.
For example, if the vet suspects autoimmune disease to be the cause, your horse may need corticosteroids to suppress an overactive immune system. Or, if feather mites are suspected, your horse will need treatment to get rid of the mites and prevent the itching from recurring., If you notice signs of infection, like a moist area with sticky discharge, get an antibiotic ointment from your veterinarian. Apply a generous layer of the medication onto your horse's cleaned legs and loosely wrap the area with clingfilm. Do this twice a day and keep treating the skin for two weeks after it looks better.Completing antibiotic treatment ensures that the infection is totally gone. This is important, since stopping treatment too early is the biggest cause of treatment failure and recurrence of the condition.
Avoid riding your horse while treatment is ongoing. This allows the skin to settle and heal.

, If your horse regularly suffers from mud fever and you've unsuccessfully tried to treat the condition yourself, there can be several reasons why treatment failed. Factors in unsuccessful treatment include:Using preventative treatment which doesn't have the needed medication to cure the condition.
The horse remaining on the wet conditions.
Underlying problems such as feather mites or autoimmune disease that have not been addressed.
Incomplete scab removing which prevents the medication from penetrating to the skin.
Hair that wasn't completely clipped away, preventing the skin from being cleaned.
Stopping treatment before the condition was completely cured.
A deep infection that needs oral antibiotics instead of a topical treatment.

Keep your horse's hooves trimmed.",How to Recognize and Treat Laminitis (Founder) in Horses," Laminitis is a disease that causes lameness in horses. It was once associated primarily with overweight ponies, but it can affect any age or size of horse.With this disease, the laminae weaken, which attach the pedal bone to the inside of the hoof.The horses pedal bone detaches from the inside of the hoof. Therefore, the pedal bone can turn, and sometimes, it even pushes through the sole.When it pushes through the sole, it's called ""founder.""This bond is composed of a non-living layer and a sensitive living layer, much like nails and the nail beds. The detachment happens when this layer disconnects.;
, The early stage of laminitis is called the acute stage. In this stage, the horse has developed laminitis, but the hoof hasn't detached yet.Pay attention to your horse's mood. He may seem down, and his appetite may be less than normal.He'll try to avoid exercise, as walking will be painful. He also might be standing differently than normal because he is trying to relieve the pain. For instance, he may push his front feet forward to relieve stress.Look for changes in walking, such as not being able to turn easily, especially on hard surfaces. Even if he seems fine while walking on soft surfaces, how he acts on hard surfaces can be a dead giveaway.Also, the horse may want to shift from foot to foot all the time., The hoof may grow in differently, creating odd rings. Also, the white might grow out larger than normal in a ring.You may notice flaky hooves or hooves that are crumbly around the edges.Also, feel the hooves, as they may be warm to the touch during the early stages., When your horse is entering the early stages of laminitis, his heart and respiratory rate can begin to increase. The heart rate may move up to 60 to 120 beats per minute, while the respiratory rate may move to 80 to 100 breaths per minute., The subacute stage of laminitis is when the laminitis has gone past 3 days, but it still hasn't detached. Symptoms are actually less noticeable in this stage, but they are the same as the acute stage, such as increased heart rate and changed walking stance., His feet are painful so he wants to take the weight off them. A typical stance is to rock backwards, putting most of his weight on his heels. This makes the horse look as if he's leaning backwards. It is also difficult to get the horse to move. Having found a relatively comfortable way of standing, he's reluctant to move and cause pain.The chronic stage begins anytime the hoof detaches.Watch for the horse wanting to rest. If the horse wants to lay down or rest more often than normal, that can be a sign of a problem. Similarly, if the horse refuses to come out of his stall or is reluctant to walk, that is likely a sign that laminitis has reached the chronic stage., Describe in detail what you are observing to your vet. Take your horse's temperature and heart/breathing rates.  Every horse owner should have a working stethoscope and rectal thermometer available, and know how to use them., If your horse is showing signs of lameness, do not force him to exercise. If he is a significant distance from home, you should transfer him by trailer. Lay down a deep bed of shavings (4 or 5 inches) in his stall. These shavings will provide padding for your horse, helping to relieve some of the pain., Taking the following measures before your vet arrives will make their job easier and give your horse some much-needed relief.


Use cold therapy. Cold therapy is much the same as it is in humans.You ice down the horse's feet just as you would an injured knee or ankle in a human. You can either use a muck tub with ice and water or use ice boots to apply the ice to the horse. Do not leave it on for more than 30 minutes.Provide an NSAID painkiller. These types of painkillers help relieve pain, of course, but they can also help with inflammation. You can give your horse Equioxx, Danilon, or Phenylbutazone (""Bute""), for instance.These are not to be given if the horse is on steroids, as the two drugs are contra-indicated together and can be a fatal combination. Always speak to your vet before giving any prescription medication to your horse.
Treatment for laminitis can vary, depending on the severity of the condition, but the mainstay for years is to get your horse started on a regimen of Phenylbutazone, which is a powerful anti-inflammatory. That, along with proper and supportive footing, are two of the treatments used in helping to alleviate the pain/disease.

, Your vet will check for the symptoms listed above by examining the horse, though she is better trained to spot the symptoms. Your vet may also want to take x-rays to examine the interior of the hoof.Ask how long you should provide anti-inflammatories to your horse. When you are giving your horse some of these drugs, such as Bute, you may need to skip a day after about a week., This drug can increase blood flow to the laminae, which helps the condition in some cases. It can also sedate your horse to some degree, which will keep him calm and less likely to injure himself further., They may be able to take some of the pressure off the foot by clever use of special shoes. They can also assess to horse to see if sole-pads are appropriate. Be cautious about applying any measures yourself because if you get it wrong you could tip the angle of the hoof and possibly precipitate the pedal bone punching through the sole of the hoof.You can cut a piece of thick foam to the size of the hoof. It should be a couple of inches thick to provide padding for the horse., Laminitis is sometimes caused by a horse being overweight and eating fresh pasture but not always. Other diseases can bring on bouts of laminitis. Research is still on-going concerning this disease, as its mechanisms and best modes of treatment and prevention are still not fully understood.One important test when looking for the cause is to test the blood sugar level of the horse, as too much sugar in the system is one risk factor for this disease., Certain grasses are too sugary for horses, who cannot process the starch. Often, grass in spring and fall is too sugary,as well as grass that was grown particularly for cattle.Though experts are still unsure as to why, this overabundance of starch in the horse's body can lead to laminitis.Avoid feeding your horse on cattle pasture, and also avoid putting your horse to pasture soon after a frost. In addition, closely grazed grass can result in pasture that is too sugar-rich for your horse., Though horses can eat some cereal in their feeds, try to avoid feeding too much. You should especially limit cereals rich in molasses. Similar to overly sugary grass, too much grain can cause excess starch in the body, leading to laminitis.Don't feed more than 3 to 4 pounds of cereal to your horse at one time., Infection in another part of the body can also lead to laminitis. For instance, a horse that doesn't deliver all the afterbirth may develop an infection. In turn, that horse can develop laminitis.Other sicknesses can lead to laminitis, too, such as Cushing's Disease. Be on the lookout for laminitis if your horse has Cushing's., If your horse recently had a round of steroids, make sure to be on the lookout for the symptoms of laminitis. You should particularly pay attention when your horse has had a very large dose of steroids.Please note, steroids and bute must not be given together; it can be fatal. If you horse develops post-steroid laminitis, always speak to your vet before giving bute to relieve the pain.

, Another factor that can lead to laminitis is working horses too strenuously on hard ground, such as concrete. In addition, horses who are overweight can suffer from laminitis, as the extra weight adds pressure to the hooves., If you don't keep your horse's hooves trimmed, it can place excessive pressure on the hooves. That pressure can damage the laminae, which in turn can lead to laminitis.Hire a local farrier to keep your horse's hooves trimmed. In addition to keeping the hooves trimmed, the farrier will know what to look for with laminitis, so she may catch it earlier than you."

Feel for any sensitive spots on your horse’s body.,
Check your horse’s hooves.,
Observe your horse moving and trotting.,
Check if your horse is urinating more often.",How to Spot Early Signs of Lameness in Horses1," Start by running your hands over your horse’s whole body, from his head and ears to his torso and down each leg. Notice if your horse flinches, shrinks away, pins down his ears, or flicks his skin as you place your hands on any of these areas, particularly his legs. If he reacts with any discomfort or pain in a certain area, this may be a sign that a muscle is irritated.You should also feel for any obvious swelling on any areas or any heat coming from a specific muscle or spot. These could all be signs of an irritated muscle that is causing lameness in your horse.
You can check if your horse looks less muscular from side to side, as his muscles may be smaller and less well-defined if there is pain in that leg from lack of use.;
, You can also check for signs of lameness by looking at your horse’s feet and hooves. Your horse may have lameness in his front leg, for example, leading to pain on his hoof. His hoof may be smaller than the opposite hoof, a sign of possible lameness.You should also look for signs that the shoes or hoof walls are wearing more quickly on the comfortable side. Your horse may be putting his weight more on the comfortable side to avoid putting weight on the painful side or foot that is causing the lameness.

, Have your horse move in a circle, going in both directions. You may have him move around with no rider, and then with a rider. Having him move in a variety of situations can help you pinpoint if he is lame.Notice if the horse looks relaxed and is taking smooth, generous strides. Pay attention to how his head and neck move in rhythm with his neck. If he does not bend smoothly when going in a circle or move the same way in both directions, this may be a sign that he is lame.
You might find it helpful to watch your horse in a ring with a fence. This gives you a level surface to judge the animal’s head and makes it easier to see a head bob.
You may also notice that he does not have normal head movements and that he is not landing evenly with his feet. He may also be dragging a hoof or stumbling when he moves. As your horse trots, close your eyes and listen to hear whether he drags a hoof as he moves. These are signs of lameness.
You can also watch him move from behind. Look at your horse’s rump to see if it rises and falls equally from left to right. You may see a marked hip drop on one side if he is showing signs of lameness. You should also check to see if his back legs move forward in a straight line. If he wobbles or limps on one side, he is likely lame.

, You may also notice that your horse is going to the bathroom more often than usual, which usually occurs when your horse is experiencing stress or pain. Your horse may urinate more than normal or defecate more often.Horses that are experiencing back pain or muscular hind pain may also go to the bathroom more often than normal when they are saddled and carrying a rider.

Store grain and feed securely so that horses can't get to it.,
Rotate pasture and paddock areas.",How to Prevent Laminitis in Horses1," Horses like to eat, and if they find a bag of oats left unattended, they will consume the entire bag, which could cause horse laminitis.


Use plastic storage bins with locking tops. This will keep horses, mice and other rodents out of the grain.
Keep the grain containers behind a closed door, such as in a tack room or storage shed. Preventing laminitis includes keeping horses safe from themselves.;
,


Green pasture grass contains high levels of starch and sugar, which may trigger horse laminitis. The starch and sugar content is highest in the spring and during the day.
In the spring, when lush grass starts growing tall, prevent equine laminitis by turning horses out for only a couple of hours, and gradually increase the amount of time they spend in the lush grass until they have become accustomed to the high starch and sugar diet.
Horses that have had issues with laminitis in the past are more likely to succumb to laminitis again, and should never be left to eat freely in a lush pasture.
Try turning your horses out at night when the starch and sugar content in the grass isn't as high. Preventing laminitis may mean changing horses' pasture schedules to protect them from consuming too much starch and sugar.
Feed a probiotic and prebiotic: Feed a balancer that contains both a prebiotic and a probiotic. This is a simple, yet very effective way of maintaining good gut health and aiding the digestion of fibre.
Avoid fructans: the level of fructan in grass can vary with the changing seasons. The spring and autumn growing seasons are when fructan is at its highest level. With our winters becoming milder and our summers becoming wetter, the growing season has become extended. Because of this, it is important to observe grass growth. Not only should you monitor the field that your horse is grazing, you should keep an eye on surrounding fields that are not grazed to get an idea of how fast the grass is growing and therefore how much your horse is eating.

"
Notice if your horse appears grumpy or irritable.,
Pay attention to how your horse interacts with others.,
Look for changes in your horse’s appetite and work ethic.",How to Spot Early Signs of Lameness in Horses2," You can also look for signs of lameness by observing your horse’s demeanor, as horses often have a change in personality due to pain or discomfort. Watch your horse for signs of grumpiness or irritability. Your horse may appear more subdued or withdrawn. He may also become more aggressive and appear grumpy day after day.You may notice that your horse is less playful and interested in movement or physical training. This could be a sign that he is in pain or feel discomfort due to lameness.
He may be breathing more heavily than usual and sweating more profusely than normal after a training session. This could be because he has to work much harder during training due to lameness.

, Your horse may also isolate himself from the other horses as part of his reaction to being in pain. You may try to bring him back to the herd and see if he avoids interaction with the other horses. This could be a sign that he is uncomfortable and needs medical care.You may observe that your horse is also more aggressive towards other trainers or people in his area or space. This could be because he is experiencing pain and does not want to be around others.

, You should pay attention to how often your horse feeds. A horse that is lame may have a poor appetite and be less enthusiastic about eating. He may also have a change in work ethic, where he is less excited about exercising and doing physical training.You may also notice that your horse is lying down more often than usual. This could be due to foot pain or lameness. He may be trying to stay off his feet to avoid being in pain.
If your horse refuses normal commands (like to go over jumps or pick up certain canter leads), this can indicate he is in pain and doesn’t want to do something that will hurt.

Get your horse examined by your vet.,
Describe your horse’s symptoms to the vet.,
Ask your vet about your horse’s treatment options.",How to Spot Early Signs of Lameness in Horses3," If you suspect your horse may be lame, you should get him examined by a vet as soon as possible. You do not want your horse to suffer unnecessarily or for the issue to get worse. Your vet will do a basic physical exam of your horse, feeling his feet, limbs, back, and neck to check for any sore spots.Your vet will have your horse walk on a hard flat surface, to start, so they can observe your horse’s gait. The vet will then want the horse top stand in sand or a soft surface, as this may exacerbate minor lameness and make it easier to see.
Your vet may also ask to see the horse move with a rider. This will help the vet assess the degree of the lameness and locate where exactly your horse is experiencing pain. You should therefore bring all your tack (bridle, reins, girth, saddle, and saddle pad) to the appointment, in case the vet asks to see you ride.

, You should also provide detailed information on your horse’s symptoms and medical history. This will help the vet come to a diagnosis and get as much information as possible on the state of your horse.You may tell the vet how long you have suspected that something is not quite right with your horse. You should also note any traumatic events in the horse’s life recently or in the past that may have contributed to the lameness. This might include trailer accidents, falls while riding, kicking stall walls, or catching a leg somewhere.
You should tell the vet about any similar lameness the horse has experienced in the past and if the lameness now appears worse after resting the horse or after a training session with the horse.

, Once your vet has determined the exact area on your horse that is lame, they will recommend a treatment. Your vet may suggest painkillers for your horse as well as frog supports for your horse’s feet.Your vet may also recommend bed rest for the horse so the horse can recover. This just means confinement to a stall with hand walking, if recommended.
You may need to adjust the horse’s diet during the bed rest so the horse does not become overweight. Consult with your vet about this.

Avoid riding on rocky terrain if your horse doesn't have shoes on.,
Consider having shoes put on at least the front feet of your horse to help protect the hooves when traveling along roads.",How to Prevent Laminitis in Horses2," Preventing laminitis means knowing your horse's feet, and recognizing lameness or a sore foot right away.

, This may prevent equine laminitis, keep the hooves from growing too long, and ensure your equine has well balanced feet.

,


Biotin supplements contain vitamin B, which helps hooves grow. Biotin is found naturally in alfalfa, barley and oats.
Biotin is also used to help animals that have horse laminitis.

, Preventing laminitis includes good riding practices. Rocks can bruise the horses hoof, which may leave them at risk for foot ailments, such as laminitis.

, Pavement has no rebound, like sand or dirt, and is hard on your horse's feet.

Herbs are a good additive to any feed.",How to Manage a Laminitis Prone Horse,";
, Obesity has been links to Laminitis, as well as other conditions. By monitoring your horse's weight every 2 weeks and plotting the results on a graph, minor weight changes can be seen early. To monitor your horse's weight you can use condition scoring, a weigh tape or a weight bridge.

,



Feed little and often. (No more than 2kg per feed for a 500kg horse. No longer than 4 hours without feed/forage.)

Make all dietary changes slowly over 1 or 2 weeks.

Make sure feed rooms and feed bins are horse proof, to prevent a horse from breaking in and gorging themselves.

, Fructan is a type of sugar found in grass and hay. Certain types of grass have more than others. Timothy and cocks foot have less than Italian rye grass. Change grazing, or re-seed if possible.

, This is especially important when the grass is stressed, (after it's been cut for hay or during a frost) during the day when it's it full sun, or during times of high growth (spring and possibly autumn after a dry summer). Grazing can be restricted by strip grazing or using a grazing muzzle.

, Mature, timothy and meadow hay are lower then early cut rye grass. Oat straw is even lower.

, Both have been connected to Laminitis. Avoid high starch feeds like cereals and high sugar feeds like molasses. Replace these feeds with fiber and oil based feeds, including unmolassed sugar beet, chaffs, alfalfa and neat oil.

, Laminitis is thought to be linked to insulin resistance (similar to diabetes in humans). Certain supplements have been known to aid this condition, including cinnamon and magnesium.

, Though care needs to be taken, as many herbs cannot go hand-in-hand as they counteract each other and others can cause severe problems. As a rule, the only 3 herbs that should be used together unless otherwise stated by a veterinarian or equine herbalist are rosehips, chamomile, and garlic. For a horse that has Laminitis or has actually foundered, rosehip is the best herb. It promotes hoof growth and repair and help to calm the horse to a certain degree. It is also good for their coat. It can be added directly into their feed, and as a rule of dosages. Ponies: 1 teaspoon, Galloways: 1 to 2 teaspoons, Hacks: 2 teaspoons, and 3 teaspoons if the horse is a warmblood or heavy draft.

Agree to your vet performing other diagnostic tests.",How to Identify a Hoof Abscess in Horses," Hoof abscesses occur when bacteria get trapped in the hoof. Pus then builds up, which increases pressure in the hoof because there isn’t much room for the hoof to swell. This pressure becomes extremely painful to a horse, causing it to become lame.If your horse has a hoof abscess, it may not be able to put any weight on the affected hoof.Lameness due to a hoof abscess can occur very suddenly, or it can gradually develop over a few days.;
, Because hoof abscesses can cause lameness so suddenly, a horse owner may think their horse has a leg fracture.Before examining the affected hoof, look at the lower leg for signs of injury, such as scratches and swelling.Don’t worry if you’re not sure if your horse has a leg fracture. Your vet can determine if your horse has fractured its lower leg.

, If your horse has a hoof abscess, the hoof wall will feel warmer than usual.This warmth is a sign of inflammation, which is the immune system’s response to injury or infection. Be very careful when you touch your horse’s hoof wall, since the hoof may be very painful to the touch.


If your horse will let you, touch the coronary band (hair line just above the hoof). This area may also be painful if your horse has a hoof abscess.When pressure builds up in the hoof, the pus will travel the path of least resistance to relieve this pressure. This path is usually upwards toward the coronary band, so you may see pus drainage just above the hoof if the abscess has ruptured., The pastern is the area on a horse’s lower leg between the hoof and fetlock (lower leg joint). If you put one or two fingers on the back of your horse’s pastern, you will be able to feel a strong pulse. This is because the hoof abscess has caused an increased blood flow to pastern.As with touching the hoof wall, use caution when touching the pastern.

, A hoof abscess can occur if something sharp, like a nail or screw, punctures the sole and creates an entry way for bacteria. If the hoof is soft, bacteria can enter the hoof through the white line (where the hoof wall meets the sole). Bacteria can also gain entry if the sole is brittle and cracked.Gently lift up your horse’s hoof and examine the sole for cracks, softness, or puncture wounds.


You may not see any signs of damage or swelling on the hoof. If you do see a nail or other puncturing object in the hoof, do not pull it out. Leave it in so your vet can see the exact point of entry.If your horse is resistant to you touching its hoof, do not continue trying do so. It is better for you to remain safe and have your vet examine the hoof.

, If you think your horse has a hoof abscess, contact your vet right away.Your horse will likely be in a lot of pain, so taking your horse to your vet as soon as possible will allow for early diagnosis and prompt treatment.

, During the appointment, give your vet a detailed history of the hoof abscess.Describe when you first noticed your horse’s lameness, and what you saw when you examined the affected hoof and lower leg. The more history you can provide to your vet, the easier it will be for them to make a diagnosis and treatment plan.

, When a horse is lame, an equine vet will perform a detailed lameness exam to determine the cause and severity of the lameness. One aspect of the lameness exam is an overall visual exam of the horse. Your vet will look at your horse to see how it walks and stands, and will take a close look at your horse’s hooves and lower legs to identify abnormalities (e.g., swelling, wounds).Your vet may do this visual exam as you explain the history of the hoof problem.
A lameness exam will help your vet rule out other causes of lameness, such as a fracture.This is important, since a hoof abscess can resemble other injuries or illnesses., A hoof tester is an instrument that tests the sensitivity of a hoof to focal pressure. During the lameness exam, your vet will use the hoof tester to apply pressure to different areas of the affected hoof. The part of the hoof that is most sensitive to pressure will indicate the general area of the abscess., Once your vet has identified a general area of the abscess, they will want to clean the hoof to identify the exact entry point of the bacteria.Your vet will use a paring knife to scrape away the old sole and clean the hoof., As part of the lameness exam, your vet may want to perform diagnostic nerve blocks. For a nerve block, your vet would inject a local anesthetic into a nerve to block the pain of everything below the block. This would help your vet localize your horse’s pain and identify the abscess's location.Your vet may also want to take x-rays. X-rays can help rule out a leg fracture.Also, if your vet found a sharp object stuck in the sole, they may want to take an x-ray with the object in place to see the path of entry for the bacteria.If your vet cannot find a wound or draining tract in the sole, they may want to take an x-ray to look for pockets of gas, which would indicate the presence of bacteria."

Seek the help of a veterinarian.",How to Tell if Your Horse Needs Hock Injections," There is considerable overlap between signs of pain in the lower back, hip, or hock, however a horse that shows any of the following symptoms should be investigated to find the cause of the pain. The methods described in the previous step can help to determine if the pain is caused by the hock.;
, Some horses interpret pain as something that is attacking them and their instinct is to flee away from it. Thus some horses become cranky when ridden and charge at jumps, or refuse fences, or buck when they were previously mild-mannered.A change of character such as trying to bite an owner when grooming the back end, bucking, or general bad temper, can be a sign of pain.

, Another common presentation is that the horse does not work to his full potential. He attempts to limit the discomfort by not exerting himself, which could mean he:


Doesn’t move as quickly or easily.
Doesn’t reach normal height when jumping.

, This phrase means that your horse tries to take weight off his hind quarters and shifts his center of gravity forward. When he does this:


He places more weight on his front legs and he moves in a more labored manner because it takes more effort to lift his front legs.
Pain alters the way the horse moves, which is referred to as his ""gait"". Hock and back end pain tends to make the horse ""mince"" or take shortened strides with his hind legs. He transfers weight onto his forelegs, which gives him a hunched silhouette with his hind quarters tucked under and head carriage low.
When riding the horse have a friend stand parallel to the horse and video his movement. Look for the horse lowering his head to counterbalance the back end. Look to see if all the legs are taking equal length steps or is one leg taking shorter strides than the others.When riding the horse have a friend stand a safe distance behind the horse and take a video. Look to see if the hips move up and down and equal amount. A horse with a sore back leg will try to protect that leg with the result that the hip moves less., For fluid movement, the horse uses the power in his back end and bunches his hind legs beneath him to provide forward impulsion.


If the horse associates pushing off on his hind legs with pain he will be reluctant to do this, and will most likely move more slowly than normal.

, Jumping requires the horse to shift his weight backwards and place a considerable extra load on his hind legs. If soreness or pain is present, he may try to avoid this discomfort by not fully using his muscles to propel himself upward.


Your horse may lose height early, which means he will knock against jumps he used to take with ease.

, Landing after a jump involves tucking the hind legs beneath the body so as to provide the spring to push the horse forward onto his next stride.


When your horse has a painful back leg, he may slip and land awkwardly.

, Hock pain or general hind end discomfort alters the way a horse stands. He tends to shift his weight so as to minimize stress on the sore leg.


He may preferentially rest one hind leg while standing.
He may also have a tendency to stand with the sore leg tucked under his belly so that the hock is straight and the leg does not have any weight on it.

, Pain alters the way the horse moves, which is referred to as his ""gait"". Hock and back end pain tends to make the horse ""mince"" or take shortened strides with his hind legs. He transfers weight onto his forelegs, which gives him a hunched silhouette with his hind quarters tucked under and head carriage low.


Because it hurts to flex the joint, the horse may not pick his leg up cleanly, and may have a tendency to stumble.
A useful tip is to walk and trot the horse on sand so that you can trace his hoof prints. The sore leg tends to move towards the midline, rather than following the line of the matching front leg.
If your horse’s hock is injured, your horse may have a hard time walking backwards in a straight line. This is because the sore leg takes shorter strides and so the horse naturally moves in a curve to the affected side.

, If you notice that there is a loss of muscle mass over the thigh and hip of the affected leg, your horse may have a problem with his hock. This loss of muscles mass is a result of ""disuse atrophy"", which means that the horse has been protecting that leg and underusing. When muscles do not get used, they can begin to waste away.However be aware that disuse atrophy can arise because of pain anywhere in the limb and does not localize the discomfort to the hock.

, If you're sure your horse has a mobility issue, it is a good idea to call in the vet to give the horse a thorough check over. If you wish to continue the assessment yourself, localize the problem to the hock.

, An injury to the hock, such as a sprain, causes the damaged tissues to release hormones such as histamine, prostaglandins, and bradykinin. These chemicals act on the blood vessels and make them leaky so that fluid pools in the area of the injury, causing swelling. This has a two-fold effect; the fluid helps isolate any harmful noxious substances from the general circulation, and the fluid is also rich in white cells to protect against infection.


If in doubt that the hock is swollen, compare one back leg with the other. Look to see if the areas that normally 'go in' are puffy and baggy. Sometimes feeling the normal hock and then feeling the other side, can help you appreciate a difference in how they feel.

, If you notice that there is a loss of muscle mass over the thigh and hip of the affected leg, your horse may have a problem with his hock. This loss of muscles mass is a result of ""disuse atrophy"", which means that the horse has been protecting that leg and underusing. When muscles do not get used, they can begin to waste away., The inflammation of the hock generates heat. Because of this, you should feel along the hock. If the area feels hotter than other surrounding parts of your horse, your horse may have sustained an injury in the hock.


Check the temperature of the injured hock to that of the hock on the other leg.

, The basis of this test is that the hock joint is flexed (bent) to an extreme position and held there for 30 seconds to 3 minutes. The theory is that when the joint is already painful, your horse will display a heightened lameness when you release the leg. To do this test:Before the flexion test: Stand behind the horse and have the horse trot away from you in a straight line. Try to notice which hop moves up and down the most in comparison to the other hip.
During the flexion test: Flex the hock and repeat the trot. The theory is that if the hock is painful, the lameness will be worse than before it was flexed.
This flexion test argument is slightly flawed in that it is impossible to flex the hock joint in isolation. The action of picking up the leg and holding it in flexion also changes the position of the fetlock and hip joints. Thus, although the most stress is on the hock joint, it is possible to aggravate pain in another joint which confuses the results of the flexion test.

, The idea behind this test is that if the pain in the hock is temporarily removed a previously lame horse should become sound. You should wait to have a veterinarian perform this test. During the test:


The veterinarian first sterilizes the skin with surgical scrub, where the needle is to be inserted. A 1.5-inch needle, 20 or 22 gauge is used to inject about 1 ml of local anesthetic just below the skin along the path of the cutaneous branch of the superficial and deep fibular nerve.
After the local anesthetic is injected the flexion test is best performed within 15 minutes, because the local anesthetic can spread to the lower limb making the foot numb which can also alter gait.
If the lower limb becomes overly numb the horse may drag the leg and scuff the back of the hoof. If this happens then bandaging the lower limb is advisable in order to reduce the chance of abrasions.

, If a flexion test and regional nerve block point to hock pain, then radiography is sometimes undertaken. Radiography is useful for detecting fractures, bony change (which occurs with arthritis), bone infections, bone cancer, and swelling of the joint capsule.


To take the radiographs the vet will work with the horse in a standing position and use a portable x-ray machine. There are typically two images taken: an exposure at lateral view taken from the side (facing towards the horse), and an anterior-posterior view taken from in front of the hock joint facing towards the horse's tail.
It is possible for x-rays to come back normal and yet there still be pain in the joint. This is because x-rays tell us about boney damage, rather than inflammation of the joint lining. Many veterinarians want to rule out chip fractures before giving hock injections, because the steroid could delay bone healing if this is the underlying reason for the lameness. If the x-rays are clear but the hock is painful, this is a strong indication for giving a hock injections.

, The veterinarian will look for other tell-tale signs of discomfort such as head bobbing, unusual foot placement, shortened strides, and weight shifts. He or she will look to see that the horse's weight is evenly distributed between the opposite diagonal pairs of legs. Lameness tends to be more obvious at slower paces such as during a walk or trot.

Look at the leg.,
Call the vet.,
Know that veterinarians are able to diagnose torn or damaged tendons with the help of an ultrasound machine.,
Know that treatments can vary.,
Realize that there may be a ""splint."",
Be patient.",How to Assess Tendon Damage in a Horse," Some hints of tendon damage should be visible.


Is there any swelling in the lower portion of the leg (usually on the rear of the leg, but the front is a possibility too).
Is the affected area warm, swollen and tender to the touch?
Viewed from the side, the cannon bone area may actually resemble an archer’s bow instead of being straight.;
, Initially, if you are sure that there is damage, cold water from the garden hose on the affected area for at least 15 minutes will help with the inflammation. This is something that you can do AFTER you call your Vet and waiting for her/him to arrive. It's very important that you have your Vet examine the injury!

, These can be a great aid in determining the degree of the damage, location, and if any other structures have been affected.

, Depending on the tendon involved and the severity, treatments can be different. A severely torn tendon or ligament can take up to six months to heal, along with stall rest and supportive leg wraps.


The majority of injuries result in a minor tear or strain, which are often resolved with stall rest, leg wraps and liniments.
If the tear is major (completely separated), surgery may be required to attach the torn ends back together. This again, will require a lengthy time of wraps and stall rest.

, At times, an injury may cause a ""splint"", which is a separation or fracture of one of the splint bones (metacarpal/metatarsal one or three) in the canon bone region, on the side, more towards the rear. Again, these will heal with time and stall rest.

, Overall, tendon/ligament injuries take time and patience to heal.

While you are waiting for the vet to arrive, encourage the horse to walk on soft ground.
Gentle walking helps blood to circulate in the hooves and can relieve some of the pain by removing inflammatory toxins from the hoof.
If the horse refuses to move, she may well be in so much pain that she can't, so leave her alone.;
, If you have access to equine aspirin, then give a dose to your horse as a first aid measure while you wait for professional help.


Some types of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) are available over the counter from pharmacies, making them a useful first aid treatment.
Always make sure your horse has access to a plentiful supply of fresh water, to help with the digestion and absorption of aspirin.
Never give aspirin to a horse that is taking other medications without first consulting your vet.
AniPrin contains powdered acetylsalicylic acid mixed in a palatable molasses flavor base, designed to be mixed in feed.

The dose is 10mg/kg once daily. For a 500kg horse this equates to 5,000mg (or 5 grams) of AniPrin.
Two scoops are supplied with the product: the larger measures out 28.35grams, and the smaller 3.75grams.
Thus, a typical 500kg horse requires 1.5 small scoops of AniPrin once daily on food.



, A full recovery from a serious flare up can take 6-12 months, and especially during the first few weeks good pain relief is essential for the animal's welfare.


Over the longer term, effective pain relief involves drugs from the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) family, of which aspirin is a member.
No one drug is superior to any other, and it is largely a matter of which medication best suits a particular horse.
What works well for one horse may not help another, so if you horse remains in pain despite using a certain drug, the vet may suggest switching meds.
NSAIDs work by inhibiting the release of prostaglandins that cause inflammation and pain.
Never give NSAIDs on an empty stomach, to avoid liver and stomach damage.
Never give NSAIDs to a dehydrated animal because this could concentrate the drug and amplify its damaging effects on the kidney.
If your horse exhibits loss of appetite and increased thirst, this could be an indicator of NSAID side effects. Stop administering NSAID medications and contact your vet to seek further medical treatment., Commonly known as ""bute"" amongst horse owners, phenylbutazone reduces pain and fever.


Phenylbutazone is a prescription NSAID and needs to be prescribed by your vet.
It should not be used in combination with other NSAIDs, steroids, or given on an empty stomach.
A typical equine preparation is Butazolidin.

The dose for a 454kg horse is 2-4 grams once a day with or after food.
It is available as 1 gram tablets, an oral paste, or an oral powder containing 1 gram of phenylbutazone in a 10 gram sachet.
The manufacturer advises that you don't exceed 4 grams a day, and if possible administer the lowest effective dose.



, Flunixin is another prescription NSAID and a typical equine formulation is Banamine.


The mode of action is similar to other NSAIDs in that it inhibits prostaglandin, and therefore inflammation and pain.
It is rapidly absorbed by the stomach and small intestine, and each dose works for 24-30 hours.
The dose of Banamin is 1.1mg/kg once daily by mouth. A 500kg horse requires 550 mg (0.5gram) which is equivalent to one 20 gram sachet containing 500mg of flunixin.
Flunixin has been show to block some of the effects of endotoxins (natural toxins produced as a result of inflammation) released during the inflammatory process of laminitis.
In severe cases of founder, many veterinarians use flunixin as their first choice treatment because of this additional effect.

, Founder is a complex condition and weakens the support for the bones inside the hoof, so making sure the hoof strikes evenly is essential to prevent further damage.


Much like a broken fingernail, full repair does not happen until the damaged part of the hoof has fully grown out which takes 6-12 months.
During this time, the angles of force on the hoof changes (because of the lack of support from the laminae) and the hoof grows unevenly.
Therefore, trimming the hoof to maintain a good upright posture is critical both in the short term (to relieve pressure) and long term (for a smooth gait).
Left untrimmed, the eventual result is an Aladdin's slipper type hoof with a long slopping toe and short heels, which will predispose your horse to lameness.
You must ensure careful trimming and shortening of the toe every 2-4 weeks.

, Ideally, a horse with founder has his shoes removed.


This spares the horse the weight and concussion of its shoes hitting the ground with each step.
Removal also allows the hoof wall to expand with the inflammation, rather than being constricted.
However, it is important to make sure that the sole is concave in relation to the ground, so that the sole stays raised above the ground.
If the sole has dropped, then shoes (or pads) are necessary to prevent the horse wearing through the sole and exposing its foot bone.

, If the horn of the hoof wall is brittle and crumbly, then it is likely to chip away and cause more pain.


In addition, a poor quality hoof wall is more frequently associated with a dropped sole (the sole loses its concave arch and sits in contact with the ground).
In these circumstances, orthopedic horse shoes may be necessary to keep the hoof wall intact, lift the sole, and keep the angle of the toe bones as close to their normal anatomical position as possible.
Some common types of shoes are:

Reversed shoes. The feet are trimmed to reduce the length of the toe (to prevent the hoof being tipped backwards) and a regular shoe is put on back-to-front. The aim is to raise the heel and drop the toe to help realign the toe bones with the hoof wall.
Egg bar shoes. Instead of having an open back like a traditional horseshoe, egg bar shoes form a complete oval. Again, the idea is to provide support to the heel by raising it slightly and taking pressure off the back of the foot.
Heart bar shoes. These are a complete shoe, lacking the traditional gap, but have a ""V"" shaped metal insert (hence the ""heart"") that covers the frog. This helps to protect the painful part of the foot from contact with the ground and raises the heel to help restore the correct alignment of the pedal bone with the floor.



, Helping the horse feel comfortable enough to move around will aid his recovery. One way to do this is to attach pads to the bottom of his hooves to provide cushioning for the painful sole.


There are many different commercial varieties of pads available, of which Styrofoam pads are one example that can adapt to the shape of the individual hoof.
These are 2-inch deep pads of special foam. They come in three hoof sizes, small, medium, and large.
They are attached to the bottom of clean hooves and kept in place with gaffer tape and bandages.
The horse's weight crushes and molds the pads, providing cushioning where it is most needed.
After two days, the pads will have compressed to a half-inch of thickness, at which point a new layer should be added for extra comfort.
This is often enough to enable the horse to walk at a slow pace, which increases the blood flow to the hoof and aids recovery.
Pads should be changed when they become totally compressed and may be needed every 2 weeks, depending on the severity of the disease.
Once the initial pain has subsided, the pads can be removed and the hoof trimmed as discussed below.

, Wild horses recover by keeping moving with the herd, which promotes blood circulation in the hoof and helps remove toxins.


You can turn horses with mild laminitis out onto soft pasture with other animals to encourage them to keep moving.
The pasture must not contain lush rich grass as this can further inflame laminitis, so if suitable land is not available the horse should be stabled on soft bedding and taken for short walks every 3- 4 hours.
When walking a horse with laminitis, take it at a gentle pace and walk in straight lines, avoiding lunging or tight corners.
This is because the support for the bone inside the hoof is weak and any undue force could sheer the tendon completely.
The best surface to walk on is firm ground with a slight give, such as packed dirt.
Avoid surfaces such as sand, that shift and press into the sole.
If suitable ground is not available, you can bring your horse out on pavement with the horse wearing pads.

, Sterile abscesses can develop inside the hoof as a result of white blood cells brought in to reduce inflammation.


However, the resulting pressure build up needs to be relieved.
You can use poultices with Animalintex, or soak the hoof in a bucket of warm water with a cup of cider vinegar to help soften the horn and allow the discharge to find a route out, thus relieving the pressure.

, For some animals there is a link between diet and episodes of laminitis.


During recovery, keep a close eye on your horse's diet.
Simple sugars increase the level of insulin, which in some horses triggers laminitis.
It helps to maintain a diet low in simple sugars.
Foods that fit this description are mature grasses and hay made from mature flowering grasses.
If you are feeding your horse hay, soaking it for a couple of hours before feeding can leech out some sugars and make it moist so there is less risk of impaction colic.
Avoid feeding your horse grains and lush grass.

Get your horse vaccinated against botulism.,
Clean any wound that your horse develops.,
Understand that foals can develop intestinal overgrowth.,
Vaccinate your mares to prevent your foals from developing botulism.,
Seek medical help if you recognize symptoms of botulism.",How to Prevent Botulism in Horses1," Vaccination is useful in areas where a known botulism problem exists. Because botulism is relatively rare, blanket vaccination protocols of all horses are not commonly undertaken.


A good example of the effective use of vaccination is in broodmares in Kentucky to provide antibody immunity to their foals.
Vaccination involves 3 initial dose vaccinations, followed by a single annual booster vaccination.;
, Although this is an uncommon source of botulism, it is possible for a wound to become contaminated with clostridia from the soil.


In this case, it's essential to clean out the wound as quickly as possible in order to reduce the contamination and allow the body's immune system to destroy the clostridia.
The technique used to cleaning the wound is called lavage. It is best done immediately, with a hosepipe. To do this: secure the horse in a yard and pass running water over the wound for 5 minutes in order to thoroughly wash away any contamination.

, A foal's immune system matures around 5-6 months of age; before this age, the immune system is immature and not as efficient at fighting off infection.


Very young foals (less than 10 days old) are particularly susceptible to clostridium botulinum overgrowth in the gut. This is because their intestinal flora are not yet developed enough to keep clostridium in check.
This allows the clostridium to reproduce unchecked and start to release botulinum toxin. The botulin toxin interferes with nerve conduction and these foals are known as ""shaker foals"" because of a generalized trembling and shaking when they are at rest or when they try to walk or move.

, Vaccinating the brood mare results allows a good level of immunity to be passed onto her foal via shared via colostrum and milk.


By the time this maternally derived antibody protection starts to fade (when the foal is 10-12 weeks of age) the foal's immune system is much stronger, and its gut flora well established.
This means that the clostridium cannot grow unchecked in the foal's intestines, as it is challenged by healthy bacteria in the gut.

, Symptoms of botulism usually start around 7-10 days after contamination. The botulinum toxins block the action of the nerves on the muscles. As a result, the first signs of botulism are muscle weakness and poor co-ordination.


In the early stages the horse has muscle tremors. When he walks he takes an unusually short stride, and may stumble and seem weak. The horse's tail hangs limply, and he is unable to raise it in the usual manner when moving his bowels or urinating, causing it to become soiled.
As the illness progresses, the horse cannot control his tongue and it hangs out of his mouth. He is unable to eat or drink because the muscles needed to swallow no longer work.
Finally, the muscle weakness becomes so severe that the horse cannot stand and must lie down. In the end, the horse dies from paralysis of the respiratory muscles.

"

Understand how contamination occurs.,
Prevent your water from becoming contaminated.,
Check your horse’s feed for contamination.,
Be wary of clostridium in the soil.,
Keep your hay botulism-free.,
Do not feed your horse haylage unless your horse is vaccinated.,
Avoid using poultry manure in areas where your horse will be grazing.",How to Prevent Botulism in Horses2," When the bodies of dead animals get into the water supply, this can provide a source of contamination for clostridium botulinum.


In response to declining oxygen in the dead body, clostridium is activated, causing it to release botulinum toxin. The toxin then disperse throughout the water. When a horse drinks this contaminated water, he ingests the toxin and becomes ill.
Another common reason for the presence of clostridium is when an infected mouse or rodent gets into the grain store and then dies. The dead body releases the botulinum toxin, which then contaminates the feed.
Sometimes grain is contaminated with the resting, or spore, form of clostridia. If this happens, the horse may eat the grain and the clostridia starts to produce the toxin in the low oxygen environment of the stomach.

, The key to preventing your water supple from becoming contaminated is the regular inspection of open water tanks, standing water, and free-flowing rivers to ensure prompt removal of carcasses.


Where possible, cover water tanks so that vermin cannot fall in, drown, and provide a reservoir of potential infection.
If a carcass is discovered in a horse trough, the body should be removed, the tank drained and disinfected, and refilled with fresh water.
If a standing body of water was contaminated and it is not possible to drain it, then fence the area off. If this is not practical, then consider vaccinating the horses drinking from the pond.

, Clostridium thrives in damp, warm conditions, thus avoid feeding your horses any grain that smells musty or appears damp. Only buy good quality grain from reputable sources, where it is kept in vermin-proof, damp free containers.


Botulism tends to occur in clusters as a result of groups of horses being fed the same contaminated grain. Therefore, if several horses in your local area die of botulism (which is very rare), it is worth asking around and investigating the common factor, so you can avoid it.
Also remember to keep grain stores in rodent proof containers so that they are less likely to be contaminated by carcasses.

, Clostridium can get into the soil in its dormant, or spore, form. This form is very hardy and resistant to destruction. Therefore you should rake the surface of your soil regularly to keep your it from becoming contaminated.


Clostridium likes damp conditions, such as under leaf mulch, so where possible minimize the amount of mulch and compost by regularly raking of the surface.
When hay is cut, avoid raking up the soil and including it in the bale. The soil may inadvertently introduce clostridium into the hay. In the right conditions, such as the center of a large hay roll where it is warm and there is very little moisture, there is a greater risk of botulinum toxin release.

, Once the hay is cut, bale it with a moisture level of around 35-50%. If this is not possible, add an acid preservative during the baling process. Either of these things (humidity or acidity) helps the pH to drop to below 4.5, which inhibits the growth of clostridium.

, Haylage is a form of fermented hay. Unfortunately, fermented, low-oxygen, high-moisture fodder provides the ideal conditions in which clostridium thrive.


Because of the higher risk of acquiring botulism from haylage, it is should only be fed to horses who have been vaccinated against the condition.

, Avoid the use of poultry manure on pasture land intended for horses to graze, or on land where the hay grown is fed to horses.


This is because poultry manure carries a risk of clostridia contamination, which can spread to the horses through the soil or hay.

Inspect the stall.,
Clean and disinfect the stall.,
Make the stall comfortable and safe for your pregnant mare.,
Acclimate your mare to the stall.",How to Prepare a Stall for a Pregnant Mare," It is very important to purchase bedding that is appropriate for both your mare and her newborn foal. Examples of ideal stall bedding are dust-free straw and shredded paper.Bedding is available at your local pet store or tack shop.

Do not use wood shavings or sawdust as bedding. These materials can release particles into the air that could irritate the newborn foal’s eyes, lungs, and mucous membranes.In addition, these particles could contaminate your mare’s birthing canal, increasing the risk of bacterial infection in your mare and her foal.;
, Wooden foaling rails, also known as boards, would keep your mare off the stall’s walls and out of the stall’s corners—areas which could pose an injury risk to the foal during foaling.If the rails are not available at your local pet store or tack shop, consult with your veterinarian for recommendations on where to purchase them.

, It will be important for you to have supplies on hand for foaling. For example, you should have several large, clean towels to dry off the foal.You will also need a disinfectant solution (e.g., povidone iodine, chlorhexidine) in a small cup. After foaling, you will dip the foal’s umbilicus (belly button) in the disinfectant to prevent infection.In addition, you should have a watch, pencil, and notepad to record the timing of each of the three stages of labor.Additional supplies include a flashlight, one or two five-gallon buckets, mild soap, and a durable trash bag (to collect the placenta). Plastic or rubber gloves, tail wrap material, a halter, and a lead rope will also be helpful.Wrapping your horse's tail will help keep the tail clean and away from the birthing canal.
Include the contact information for your veterinarian, and a back-up veterinarian, with your other supplies.Visit your local pet store and tack shop for the supplies. You can also ask your veterinarian if you are unsure where to obtain all of the supplies.
Organize all of the supplies in one or two sealable buckets outside of the stall so that everything you need will be close by when your mare is foaling., You should begin preparing the stall about four to six weeks before your mare’s scheduled foaling date. Since mares prefer to foal in private,select a stall that is in a quiet, private area of your barn.The stall should be at least 14 square feet.If no stalls are this large in your barn, you may need to create a ‘double stall’ by removing the barrier between two stalls.The stall should be in a well ventilated area of your barn., The stall should be free of any potential physical hazards. For example, remove any raised nails or large splinters in the stall.Water and feed buckets could be hazards for the foal when it attempts to stand to its feet. Position the buckets high enough to prevent the foal from injuring itself when it moves around the stall.Inspect the feed and water containers for any sharp edges. Replace the containers if necessary.

, A clean birthing environment is essential to preventing infection in your mare and her foal.To clean the stall, remove any old bedding. Next, clean the walls, floor, and feed and water containers with hot, soapy water and a long-handed wire scrub brush.Allow several days for the stall and containers to dry completely before disinfecting them.Povidone iodine and pine oil are good disinfectants. After disinfecting the walls, floor, and feed and water containers, allow several days for everything to dry.Lime has been recommended has a disinfectant for a stall floor,but can cause skin irritation.Consult with your veterinarian if you are unsure about which disinfectant to use in the stall., After the stall has dried, place several inches of clean, fresh bedding in the stall.Also, mount the foaling rails approximately 10 inches (25 cm) off each of the stall’s walls and 10 inches (25 cm) above the floor.Consider contacting a friend or neighbor to assist you with mounting the foaling rails.
If your mare will be foaling during the winter months, install a heat lamp in the stall to keep the area warm.Place the lamp high in a corner where your mare will not bump her head on it.
If necessary, adjust the location of the heat lamp so that your mare does not become uncomfortably warm in the stall.

, Introduce your pregnant mare to the prepared stall four to six weeks before her scheduled foaling date.It is important for your pregnant mare to be comfortable and relaxed in the stall in which she will give birth.


Introducing your mare to the stall well before her due date will allow her immune system to build up antibodies to any microorganisms that may be in the stall—she would then pass these on to her foal."
"
Contact your veterinarian if the problem has become an ongoing issue.,
Begin treatment if your mare has tested positive for common molds and common allergens.,
Try administering a respiration supplement recommended by your vet.",How to Manage a Horse with Breathing Problems1," Your vet will do a thorough exam, and possibly blood work to ensure that there is no long-standing infection/inflammation, and to assess internal organ health.


If your vet suspects allergies, they may suggest allergy testing, which can be something as simple as a blood draw or skin testing. In skin testing, vets will inject small amounts of suspected allergens under the skin and observing the body's reactions. The skin testing is normally done in a specialty clinic or teaching hospital.





;
, Molds and allergens are commonly found in the dust, hay, and the rest of the horse's environment, so this diagnosis is by no means uncommon. Listen to your vet for recommended treatments/environmental changes that may help alleviate her condition, listed below.

, A respiration supplement, designed to ease breathing, can help in some cases. One such product is called ""Tri-Hist"", which is an antihistamine available by prescription only.

"
Purchase a horse measuring stick marked with hand measures.,
Make sure the horse is standing on firm level ground with its front feet as even as possible.

,
Place the horse measuring stick or measuring tape at the base of one of the horse's front feet and pull the measuring device up to the withers.,
Record the measurement.",How to Measure the Height of Horses," If a horse measuring stick is not available, a standard measuring tape is acceptable.


Horse measuring sticks can be found at equestrian supply stores (tack shops), farm supply stores and from various online retailers.;
,,


The withers is located at the top of the shoulders between the neck and back and is considered the highest point on a horse. The highest point of a horse is actually the top of its head, (also known as the poll), but since a horse moves its head up and down frequently, it is difficult to record this measurement accurately.
Stretch the measuring device to the highest point of the withers. More precisely, extend the measuring device up to the spiny ridge between the horse's shoulder blades.

,


If the horse measuring stick is being used, then the measurement can be recorded in hands immediately. If a measuring tape is being used, conversion of the measurement from inches to hands is required.
One hand equals 4 inches (10.2 cm), so divide the measurement by 4. For example, if the horse measures 71 inches (180.3 cm), divide 71 by 4 inches. The result is 17 hands with 3 inches (7.6 cm) left over. The final height would be recorded as 17.75 hands.

"
Turn the horse out as much as possible, especially if she is confined to her stall or a barn most of the day.,
Fully muck out the stable once or twice a week.,
Use dustless bedding.,
Feed haylage or soak hay for a few minutes.,
Make sure all feed is mold free.,
Feed from the ground level.,
Ensure that there is proper ventilation in the stable.,
Vacuum the rafters, walls, and window ledges in the stables regularly.,
Build the muck heap and hay store area downwind.,
Water your pasture in a very dry season, to prevent it going dusty.

,
Use a product to reduce or absorb ammonia.,
Feed hay or alfalfa cubes instead of mixes, as they have less dust.",How to Manage a Horse with Breathing Problems2," A little fresh air is good for the respiration. A mare stuck in the barn all day, breathing in the same stale air, might be more prone to breathing problems.

, Cleaning up after your mares and offering them a tidy living arrangement is a boon both psychologically and for health reasons.

, Rubber matting is best but usually needs a small amount of absorbent bedding on top, such as wood shavings. Another useful bedding for allergy cases is cardboard ripped into small pieces. It's very absorbent and easy to manage.

, This helps to cut down the normal dust/pollens that are present in dried hay. Soak only long enough to get the hay thoroughly wet, as soaking any longer can actually reduce the starch and sugars that are normally present in the hay, which are needed for proper nutrition.


If you happen to have an overweight or laminitic horse, you may want to soak the hay in water for a bit longer, as reduced starch and sugar can be a good thing.







, A simple exam of the hay prior to feeding should be sufficient in determining if the hay is clean.

, This process prevents excess dust and other irritants from being inhaled while your horse is eating.

, You can leave the stable door open and use a stall chain instead.

, During your vacuuming, include any room that shares the same air space as the stables (e.g. the tack room).

, Bagged bedding and haylage are safe to store near the horses.

,, There are several such products available at your local feed store.

, There are also many ""complete"" pelleted diets available these days, and although they can get expensive, they are totally dust free. If you choose to go to a complete diet, be sure that the diet doesn't have any of the allergens that she is allergic to.

Check your horse's basic diagnostics.,
Examine your horse's eyes, nose, and mouth.,
Examine your horse's coat and skin.,
Evaluate your horse's bowel movements.,
Check your horse's urine.,
Check the color of your horse's gums.,
Check to see whether your horse is sweating more than usual.,
Assess whether your horse is standing oddly.,
Watch your horse move around.,
Consider whether your horse has exhibited dullness.,
Determine whether your horse exhibits signs of restlessness.,
Assess whether your horse is eating as usual.",How to Know if Your Horse Is Sick," This means your horse's pulse/heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature.



Pulse - The normal heart rate for a horse is 25-42 beats per minute. To check the horse's heart rate, place your palm on the horse's chest just behind the left elbow and feel for the bump-bump-bump of the heart beat. Count how many beats there are in a minute; this is the heart rate. It can also be useful to routinely calculate your horse's resting heart rate. Knowing what your horse's regular or normal rate is will make it easier for you identify abnormalities in the heart rate. Note that a consistently racing heart rate when the horse is resting (i.e., one that is higher than the usual upper limit of 42 beats/minute) can be a sign of heart disease or infection. If you discover your horse has a racing heart even when she's resting, get her checked out by a vet.Respiratory rate - The normal respiratory rate for horses is 10-24 breaths per minute. To check your horse's respiratory rate, stand back and watch her chest movements. One in-out movement of the chest counts as one breath. Count how many times this happens in one minute. It's best to do this check when your horse is resting so that this will be an indication of her normal respiratory rate. Make sure to wait to check her respiratory rate until at least half an hour after exercise. A raised respiratory rate during resting can be indicative of many different problems, including infection, allergy, fluid in the lungs, heart disease, and possibly cancer. All of these require veterinary attention.Temperature - The normal equine temperature is 98-101 Fahrenheit or 37.2 - 38.3 Celsius. A temperature above 38.3 Fahrenheit is considered raised. You should monitor your horse's temperature if it reaches 38.3 degrees.If the temperature is between 38.3-38.8, then take your horse's temperature every couple of hours until the fever breaks.If the temperature rises above 38.8, call your vet. Such a high temperature is a sign of infection or severe inflammation.;
, Look for any unusual and sticky discharge, such as yellow or green pus. This may be an indication that your horse is sick. If you see any blood, contact the vet immediately.When checking the eyes, look to see if the eyes appear sunken in or the eye area appears hollowed out a bit. This could be a sign of Horner's syndrome, a disease relating to the nervous system that is common in many animals.Check also to see if the eyelids look droopy or if the horse's third eyelid (usually in the corner of each eye) is protruding upwards and moving over the eye; these are often symptoms of an infection or additional symptoms of Horner's syndrome. In addition, if the eyes can't fully open, you should consult a vet., A dull coat is a sign that the horse is either in poor condition, suffering from a lack of nutrition or not grooming herself properly. If this is the only symptom, it is likely not an emergency, but you would do well to mention it to the vet the next time you see him. However, if this is one of several symptoms that you notice, call the vet directly.You can also test the elasticity of your horse's skin to check whether she or he is dehydrated. Gently lift the skin covering your horse's shoulders. When you let go, the skin should instantly pop back down; if you can watch the skin fall back droopily, then the horse is dehydrated. Horses can become dehydrated if they're not drinking enough, or are losing more fluid than they're taking in. Another way to check for dehydration is to examine your horse's mouth and feel how moist the membranes lining the lips and gums are. They should feel moist and slippery; if they feel dry and tacky, this means that the horse is dehydrated. If the horse is dehydrated, make sure she has access to water and call the veterinarian., Constipation or diarrhea are both signs that something is not right with your horse. You may see your horse straining to pass feces but nothing comes out (constipation); alternatively, she may pass feces that are more liquid than usual (diarrhea). In both cases, you should consult your vet.If you notice any blood in your horse's stool, then the problem is urgent.

, Concentrated urine can appear a dark color, but so does urine that contains blood or the breakdown products of blood. If the urine consistently appears unusually dark, you should consult your vet.


If you suspect that dehydration is the cause of overly concentrated, dark-looking urine, remember that you can check the elasticity of your horse's skin to determine whether dehydration is at work.
Where possible, collect a urine sample for your veterinarian to analyze.

, Most horses' gums are pink or lightly pigmented, just like human gums. If you lift your horse's lip and the gums appear very pale, abnormally dark or muddy looking, or bright red, then contact the vet immediately.

, A horse should not sweat profusely when she is resting, unless it's extremely hot outside. Sweating is often a sign that the horse is running a fever, is fearful, or is in pain.


Note that horses lose electrolytes, such as sodium and chloride, in their sweat. This means that they become dehydrated from sweating profusely. It is therefore important to call the veterinarian if the horse is sweating heavily and yet refusing food and water., If your horse looks like she is standing in an awkward manner, this is an indication that the horse is experiencing pain somewhere in her body.


For example, if she stands rocked backwards, with her back legs placed beneath her belly and her front legs stuck out in front, this is usually a sign that she wants to take her weight off the front end because of sore feet. Sore feet can be a symptom of laminitis.
In addition, if your horse stretches herself out when standing (i.e., her front feet are very far out and her hind feet are too far behind), this may be an attempt to relieve abdominal cramps or gut discomfort. If ever you suspect gut pain, contact your vet for guidance.

, Check to see if your horse is moving stiffly or with an altered gait, or way of walking. If she is moving with stiffness or tension, she may be in pain or suffering from inflamed muscles or joints. You'll want to observe this over some time. After all, your horse may just be stiff after vigorous exercise and just needs a gentle walk to regain her full range of movement.


If, however, after some gentle walking, your horse becomes stiffer still and is reluctant to move, then call a veterinarian.

, Dullness means that the horse does not respond in her usual manner, such as greeting you with a whinny, or banging the stable door for feed.


Dullness is often accompanied by a change in body language. She may start, for example, holding her head low and her ears may fail to twitch and not respond to surrounding sounds., Does she pace more than she usually does or exhibit a hard time settling down? A horse that is restless and doesn't relax in her stable in the usual way should be monitored closely. If the horse starts to throw herself to the ground, or lies downs and rises repeatedly, or kicks at her own belly, you should call the vet. These can all be signs of colic and should not be dismissed.

, Horses are grazers, which means they eat little but eat very often. Research indicates that not eating even for 6 hours may predispose a horse to stomach ulcers, which highlights just how important regular eating patterns are to their well-being. If you notice your horse refusing food or water, or that her regular feed schedule is off, contact your vet.Watch your horse eat and check to see whether she is dropping a lot of feed while she eats. A horse's diet is high in fibre and necessitates a lot of chewing and grinding prior to swallowing. The large molar teeth towards the back of a horse's mouth are the equine equivalent of mill-stones. If your horse has a toothache, or the teeth have worn down unevenly and there is a sharp cusp digging into the cheek or tongue, then the horse will drop food out of her mouth. Sometimes this food is partially chewed and rolled up into balls, which then drop out of the mouth. This is known as quidding. Extremely messy eating and quidding are symptoms of dental discomfort and should be taken as signs to call the vet.The same goes for a horse that chews but can't swallow. These horses often appear hungry, chew their food, but then lower their heads, at which point the food usually falls out of their mouths. This can be caused by discomfort at the back of the throat, such as an ulcer or thorn between the teeth, the lodging of food in the esophagus (also known as choking), or infections like botulism."

Call the vet.,
Change your management to help strategies that will help ensure a healthy recovery.,
Look after yourself.",How to Cope when Your Horse Has Laminitis or Founder,";
, All the strategies for managing a horse prone to laminitis are also suitable for a horse with laminitis, however often have to be more strictly applied, with the advise form a vet.

, The first stages of treatment can be the most tiring for an owner. The nights will be sleepless and you will be up every 15 to 30 minuets checking the horse. A good method to cope with this sleep deprivation is to:


Get help and support from family and friends. Even if they don't have the knowledge to care for a horse they can help look after you.
Organise a bed for the lounge room, this way you will be close to the door and phone if help is needed by a vet or groom.
Ensure you have enough pillows and are warm enough. This will make you less prone to getting a sore back and feeling tired.
Watch movies or read a book, this will not only take your mind of your horse, time will move faster and you will not be so nervous and in turn your horse will get some rest.
Have good meals. Good quality food is important to help you stay in good condition and to keep your energy supply up. Eat high carbohydrates for breakfast, and eat fruit and veggies throughout the day for a snack and for lunch. For dinner, eat a sit down balanced meal. This will allow enough energy to function through the night. Make sure you have a bottle of water and drink regularly.
Set up lighting! The worse thing is when checking on a horse in the middle of the night, you can't find a torch or the light doesn't reach where you want to go. Ensure that your lighting has new globes and your torch has a new battery. Use floodlighting to generate light down into the paddock, or move the horse to a paddock with sufficient light.
If you are up during the night try to sleep when you can though the day.
Be prepared for possible situations. For example the horse is more likely to become cast if they are already getting up awkwardly. Make sure you have any equipment, phone numbers and help that you would need and that you know what to do.

Check the heart rate.,
Check the temperature.,
Watch carefully if your horse is laying down.,
Remember that it is not uncommon for a horse to get colic.",How to Know What Is Normal for a Horse," This can be checked by placing the hand under the left elbow. Count the beats for 10 seconds then multiply the beats by 6. That will tell you the heart rate per minute. A normal heart rate is 35-40 beats per minute.;
, A normal temperature is approximately 100.5 F (38 C). If it gets over 102 F (39 C), it can indicate that the horse has an infection.

, This can be normal, but make sure it is not rolling around in abnormal ways, nipping his/her side or biting his/her side. A horse lying down for a long time may be ill, but ponies lie longer than horses.

, If a horse eats freshly mowed grass, it can get colic. If you suspect this, make sure this is treated right away.


A runny nose can be due to allergies or just sweat.
A healthy horse should take between 8-12 breaths per minute and its pulse should be between 36 and 42 beats per minute.

"
"
Purchase a large dosing syringe from your Vet or the Feed Store, or a turkey baster from the grocery store.,
Mix the desired quantity of medicine or herbs in a pint or quart jar; use plastic if possible to avoid broken glass.,
If the syringe or baster will hold the entire amount of liquid, then fill it before getting around the horse.

,
If the quantity of liquid medication or herbs to be given is more than the applicator will handle, then fill the baster or syringe and keep the jar with the rest close by.,
If the horse is particularly stubborn and you have cross ties in your barn, use these.,
If the horse is cooperative, stand on a 55 gallon (208.2 L) drum, or a mounting stairs.,
Work quickly: don't give the horse time to process what is about to happen.,
Gently open the horse's mouth and squirt the liquid in the side of the mouth aiming for the back; the best way to do this is to insert your thumb into the crook of the mouth on the side closest to you and pull the cheek out from the gums; if you approach from the side it will be less threatening to the horse; you are really trying to get the medication into the cheek pocket at the back; it may help to elevate the head with one hand; normally they will begin to elevate their head once they realize you are squirting something so you can just try to keep it there.

,
Squirt the liquid slowly and steadily so the horse has a chance to swallow.,Don't let their head down right away as they may spit it out; have a small treat handy for afterward so they realize they get something good out of it; this helps a lot when you have to do this every day such as in the case of a 7-10 day course of antibiotics

,If the horse is really resisting, you can try a ""nose chain"" aka feed the chain on the lead rope through one side of their halter and twist in around the nose band and out the other side of the halter so the chain is over their nose; apply a bit of pressure when they resist to encourage head dropping but take care as this can hurt

,
Don't tie their heads to any fixed object (one ring tie, post etc.),If all else fails you can buy some soft treat mixes, or give a small amount of sweet feed with the medication mixed into it

",How to Give Horses Liquid Medications,";
, Or if they already come in liquid form, open the bottle.

,, If using a syringe or prefilled wormer express a drop or two of medication even if you lose a bit as it is often hard to depress the plunger if the plunger is all the way out

, Be sure to have an able assistant close by. Some horses don't like their head tied during this process, and will strain against the ties when they realize you are going to do something unpleasant so you can always try foregoing the cross ties and putting the lead rope over your shoulder instead

, The idea is for you to be higher than the horse if at all possible.

, . .talk to the horse in a quiet and friendly manner, and move in a ""matter of fact"" way as you normally would; if you are anxious or go ""flying at them"" they will start to resist

,, Gently massaging their throat can aid this process.

Prepare a basic first aid kit.,
Clean an open wound.,
Heal a puncture wound.,
Use the ""four Cs"".,
Give your horse time to heal.",How to Heal a Cut on a Horse1," It is very common for horses to suffer from minor cuts and wounds. Most horse owners have to deal with the situation regularly. If you own a horse, it is a good idea to keep some basic first aid supplies handy.Your kit should include some clean towels, surgical gauze, and surgical tape. You can also keep duct tape on hand.
In your kit, you should also include scissors, petroleum jelly, and ointment. Consider making sure that you have a bottle of sterile saline solution in the kit.
Your kit should hold Betadine, which is a disinfectant. You will also need tweezers and q-tips. If you travel with your horse, keep a portable first aid kit in your truck as well as at home in your stable.;
, Horses frequently rub up against things that can injure them, such as barbed wire. If you see that your horse is actively bleeding, there is an open wound. If you notice that your horse has an open wound, you need to clean it.Use sterile saline solution to clean the wound. Pour some on a clean towel and dab or pat the wound.
The purpose of cleaning the wound is to get rid of any surface bacteria. While you are cleaning, you can try to assess the severity of the wound.
When washing a wound, pour plenty of fluid on it. Let the excess fluid wash away onto the ground. In a pinch, contact lens solution can work as your saline solution.

, Puncture wounds can be serious injuries. These wounds are caused when your horse is punctured by a sharp object, such as a sharp piece of glass. If the wound is on the abdomen or chest, contact your vet immediately.If they puncture is on the upper leg or hip, you can attempt to treat the wound yourself. Slow or stop the bleeding by pressing gently on the wound with clean towels or gauze.
If the wound does not appear to be very deep, you can try to wash it with saline solution. You can try to measure the depth of the wound using a q-tip. If that causes discomfort for your horse, stop immediately.
Do not try to remove a foreign object from the wound yourself. You may unintentionally cause more damage. If there is an object stuck in your horse, wait for the vet to come before trying to treat the wound.

, For simple cuts, you can likely treat your horse yourself. But unless you have a background in veterinary medicine, you should also contact your vet at some point. When you are dealing with a wound, you can remember the proper steps by thinking of the four Cs. The first ""C"" stands for ""calm"". It can be scary to see your horse wounded, especially if he is bleeding. But keep your cool, so that you don't frighten your horse.
The second ""C"" stands for ""clean"". Using your saline solution, clean the wound. The third ""C"" stands for ""compression"". Wrap the clean wound with a compression bandage from your kit.
Finally, the last ""C"" stands for ""contact"". Contact your vet whenever your horse is wounded. Even if the cut is minor, it is better to be safe than sorry.

, Even if it appears minor, a wound can cause great discomfort for your horse. It is important to be patient and allow him time to heal. It will take several days, at a minimum, for your horse to return to normal.You will need to keep your horse confined to his stall to keep from overexercising. Consult your vet about the proper length of time for confinement.
While your horse is resting, keep his wound clean. Change the bandages regularly, even if the bleeding has stopped.
Let your horse take it easy until he is fully healed. Even if he seems antsy, make him rest until your vet gives the ok to return to his normal routine.

Follow instructions.",How to Heal a Cut on a Horse2," When your horse is sick or injured, you will need a reliable vet to turn to. Make sure that you are prepared for any eventuality by having a vet you trust on call. Take steps to make sure you have a doctor you and your horse can rely on.Ask for recommendations. Talk to friends and family to see if they can refer you to an excellent equine physician.
Talk about treatment options. Will your vet always try the most aggressive option? Or does he take a more cautious approach?
Find out who will care for your horse if the vet is unavailable. It's always a good idea to know what the back up plan involves.

, It is important to be prepared for any eventuality. If your horse cuts himself, you will need to be ready to take action immediately. Write down your action plan.Post the number for the veterinarian in more than one place. Try posting it in the barn, in your kitchen, and keep it in your cell phone contacts.
You should also write down the number to the back-up vet. Keep this number handy in various places, including inside your first aid kit.
Have a list of friends and neighbors who can help you in case of an emergency. It can be difficult to care for a scared and wounded horse. Call for help while you wait for the vet.
No matter where you are, you should know the way to the nearest equine vet. If you are traveling with your horse, make a list of treatment facilities along the route.

, When you contact the vet, it is important that you give a detailed description of what is wrong with your horse. Take note of the symptoms that your horse is exhibiting. It's a good idea to be able to recognize common signs of distress.When your horse has a cut, there are some obvious signs of trouble to look for. Bleeding and swelling are visual cues that something is wrong.
If your horse is acting anxious or scared, that is also a sign that he his hurt. Lethargy and going ""off-feed"" are also indicators that there is a problem.
Contact your vet no matter how minor you think the issue might be. Even if you take steps to heal the wound at home, call your vet to confirm that you are doing everything right.

, It is important to understand how your vet is treating your horse. Whether he visits you in person, or just offers advice over the phone, make sure you are clear on what he is saying. It's a good idea to ask a lot of questions.Be specific. Try saying, ""What is the best way to treat this cut? Is there anything I should be doing differently?""
Ask for a clear time frame. Say, ""How long do you expect the healing process to last? When can my horse resume normal activity?""
Don't be afraid to ask questions. Your vet knows you have your horse's best interests at heart.

, After all of your questions have been answered, it is time for you to listen carefully to your vet. Remember, he is the medical expert.

Understand how horses should be rehabilitated after an injury.,
Avoid letting the horse reinjure itself.,
Treat each horse, and each injury, individually.",How to Hand Walk an Injured Horse1," A horse is a heavy animal and that is coupled with the physical forces associated with galloping and jumping. The legs on a horse, especially tendons and ligaments, are particularly vulnerable to injury. Because of a horses' powerful legs, and thus the risk of re-injury, horses need a gentle reintroduction to activity after an injury.


Veterinarians are now taking a look at how people are rehabilitated from injuries. This involves a gentle return to exercise as soon as feasible, in order to keep the joints supple and joints toned.
If you own a performance horse that is stabled in a state of the art facility, then hydrotherapy may be an option, but in a regular stable environment, then hand walking is the next best option.;
, In previous decades turning an animal out was considered an option. Turning out simply entails letting the horse into a space on its own. This is not ideal because the horse is free to exercise at will and an energetic horse may gallop around a field, or kick out at other horses, and therefore do itself further harm.In past decades horses with injuries were assigned box rest. The principle of this is for the horse to use the legs as little as possible, so as not to aggravate the injury. However, this lead to other problems such as muscles wastage, stiff joints, and boredom. These types of problems could in turn lead to behavioural changes such a crib-biting, weaving, or even aggression., All horses are different, and their injuries are individual. There is no one size fits all schedule for rehabilitation. Success depends on working with your veterinarian to assess the injury and monitor progress. This allows adjustments to be made along the way should progress be slower or faster than anticipated. However, purely as a guide, the following is typical of a protocol for recovery that involves hand walking.


For example, after a ligament or tendon injury a horse will need box rest for around three weeks. This allows the original swelling to subside, and decreases the risk of further weight bearing causing a catastrophic failure (rupture) of an already stressed ligament or tendon. Hand walking starts after three weeks of rest and this is done for three weeks. The idea is to keep muscles toned, and increase the blood supply to the injured area. After 8 weeks the limb should be scanned with ultrasound to check the state of healing and your veterinarian advise whether gentle return to ridden exercise is possible or further walking is preferable."

Prepare the horse.,
Using gauze soaked in alcohol, wipe the jugular furrow of the horse.,
Press the jugular vein at the base of the neck using your thumb.,
Gently insert a syringe into the jugular vein.,
Withdraw the plunger on the needle.,
Continue to apply pressure and check for bleeding.,
Massage the injection site.,
Transfer the collected blood to a suitable container.,
Send the blood sample to the lab.",How to Draw a Horse's Blood," Make sure that the horse is properly restrained and is in a docile temperament before proceeding to take a blood sample. For blood collection, using a halter and rope is sufficient. Ask someone to assist you in restraining the horse by holding the part of the rope attached to the tie ring.;
, The jugular furrow is the longitudinal depression that runs along the neck. This is where you will find the jugular vein.


You can feel the jugular vein by pressing it with your thumb or fingers. It is very easy to find the jugular vein because you can feel it throb.
Wiping with alcohol facilitates identification of the jugular vein and at the same time disinfects the area where blood will be drawn.

, Pressing the jugular vein at the base of the neck will make it bulge, and will make blood collection easier because the vein can easily be seen and felt when the needle is inserted.

, Gently insert a syringe (5cc, 10cc, 20cc depending on the amount of blood required) with a gauge 21 needle into the bulging jugular vein at a 35 ° angle, directed to the horse’s head.


Before inserting the needle, it is important that you approach the horse from the side and massage or stroke the shoulder first, then the neck, and finally on the injection site.
It is important that you give a calm reassuring voice before and after the injection of the needle. Always remember that horses are very easily startled.

, When the needle has been inserted into the jugular vein withdraw the plunger and check if the blood is flowing. If you have correctly inserted the needle blood will flow with ease.


After withdrawing the required amount of blood, place a thumb over the injection site and gently withdraw the needle.
Placing a thumb over the injection site will stabilize the needle and prevent it from falling down as you remove the needle and syringe.

, Using gauze soaked with alcohol, press the injection site for a minute and then check for bleeding.


Pressing the injection site will prevent bleeding because the pressure exerted by the thumb or finger occludes the vessel opening created after blood withdrawal.

, Massaging the injection site for a few seconds (10 to 30) soothes any pain that the horse may experience after withdrawing the needle.


Remember that the insertion of the needle also created a small puncture wound. Massaging soothes the pain caused by the wound and relaxes the horse.
In addition, massaging the area can prevent large blood clots from forming at the injection site.

, The collected blood can then be transferred to a suitable container.


The most common and easy to use containers are vacutainers. Vacutainers are vacuum sealed and automatically suck the blood from the syringe once the needle is inserted. These containers can easily be bought in human pharmacies.
For non-clotted blood samples, transfer the blood into vacutainers with a purple top cover. For clotted blood samples transfer the blood into vacutainers with a red top cover.

, After collection, immediately send the blood sample to a laboratory, or contact your laboratory for further instructions.

Choose a suitable surface to walk the horse on.,
Have the right equipment for walking an injured horse.,
Pick the right time of day to take the horse out.,
Consult a vet before walking an injured horse.",How to Hand Walk an Injured Horse2," This should be non-slip and soft but supportive. Firm (but not hard) earth or the surface of an arena or indoor school is fine. Find a level surface, neither up or downhill, for minimum impact on the limbs.


Avoid hard surfaces such as tarmac or concrete, since these have no ""give"" and the concussive force of the hoof hitting the ground will be transmitted back up through the limb and possibly worsen the injury.
A softer more supportive surface has a greater cushioning effect and absorbs some of those concussive forces. However, avoid excessively soft substrates such as muddy ground, since these tug and pull on the leg and are hard work for the horse to walk on and maintain balance. , While it might seem obvious how to lead and hand walk a horse, you need to address safety factors before walking an injured horse. This includes having the right equipment for the type of injury your horse has and for their temperament.


The halter: For docile horses a halter is sufficient restraint but make sure it is in good repair with no frays or tears that could break if the horse pulls hard. Also, make sure it is a good fit and not too loose so that the horse can pull out of it.The lead rope: Again, make sure it is in good repair and not liable to snap when put under force. Twisted cotton or nylon rope is a good choice for a lead rope, but these can cause friction burns if pulled through your hands so it's best to wear gloves.
Never loop the rope around your hand, since if the horse pulls the tightening looks could break your fingers. Instead, with the horse to your right, hold the rope about a foot below the buckle in your right hand, allow some slack rope and grip the far end with your left hand. This allows you to let go with your right hand if necessary, without letting go of the horse. Do not be tempted just to hold the halter. If the horse jerks its head up this could dislocate your shoulder., Consider taking the horse out before a feed, then he's more likely to stop and graze than want to tank off and pull you over. While this is not ideal from the walking aspect, the horse is at least out of his stall and taking some gentle exercise as he steps forward to graze. , If all else fails, and your horse it too active, speak to your vet about sedating the horse. Vets can give you a mild sedative such as Acepromazine (ACP) to keep the horse calm. However, sedating your horse on a regular basis is not ideal. All drugs have side effects and ACP lowers blood pressure, which can in elderly animals carries a small risk of compromising kidney function.


The sedative effect can also make a horse more dozy, which makes it more liable to trip and fall.
Never use ACP in breeding stallions as it causes paraphimosis, or prolapse of the penis, with possible trauma to the penile tissues.
Also, the sedative action is not guaranteed and can go the other way and make some horses hyperactive and uncontrollable.Only give ACP as directed by your veterinarian and follow their dose recommendation. Horses vary in size and the recommended of dose of ACP varies according to the desired effect, so never give ACP without consulting your vet first. Take their advice on dosage, depending on the size, health and age of your animal, plus their temperament and the desired effect."
"
Give ACP to your horse before you take the horse out of the stall.,
Take the horse out.,
Pay attention to temperament.,
Remember to keep a good hold on an active horse.,
Lead your horse, don't allow your horse to lead you.,
Stay on a relatively straight path, keeping close to your horse.,
Slowly walk them for as long as the vet advises.,
Continue leading the horse on a regimen that your vet approves.",How to Hand Walk an Injured Horse3," This should only be done under the advisement of your veterinarian. This drug will help reduce the risk of your horse pulling away and being too active. A playful horse that pulls away has a higher risk of re-injuring itself.


Once again, never use Acepromazine on a breeding stallion. If administering ACP to a male horse ensure that his genitals are fully retracted to ensure penile paralysis does not ensue.

, Once you have outfitted the horse in proper equipment, it's time to take them out. Choose a quiet time of day when not a lot of activity is occurring. Feeding time, when there are lots of people out riding, or when other horses are being lead in and out, are not ideal times to be taking your injured horse out for a walk.

, Recall how the horse behaved when being lead before the injury. If it is a quiet, older horse, it should be easier then a younger, more energetic horse. Lead both kinds of horses slowly and deliberately; older horses will be slower to begin with, while younger horses may appear overeager but risk re-injury with forceful leads.

, If your horse is more active, then you need more control than a halter offers. Instead, fit his regular bridle since the bit will give you more control than a halter. If the horse is particularly active try carrying a dressage whip. This long whip offers you the option to block the horse's shoulders by holding it across the front of the horse's body, and effectively blocking the path ahead which can help stop him from barging forward.If the horse barges, use your weight against his left shoulder to push the horse in a circle to the right. This stops his forward movement, prevents him blocking your path, and asserts authority over him.

, This is very important. You want to demonstrate to your horse that you're the boss, however much you respect it and care for it.


If the horse you're leading is going too fast ahead of you, simply stop in your tracks with the lead line locked in your hand by your side. Face the horse and lightly tap on the front shoulder until the horse stops walking. Carrying a dressage whip can help you with this. Do this each time the horse passes you. You're teaching the horse that it'll have to stop each time it gets ahead of you, and that you're the boss.

, Stand beside the horse's left shoulder, with the horse to your right. If you carry a dressage whip and the horse is reluctant to move forward, you can gently tap their rump with the whip to encourage them to step forward.

, Follow the directions exactly. If you are not sure, ask the vet to clearly explain how long to walk them and where. It is a good idea to write this down so you can refer to the instructions later if you forget.


It is very important to follow the exact instructions, as there is a big difference between 5 and 15 minutes, which could result in re-injury and additional setbacks.
Sometimes you can graze your horse for longer, if your horse will graze quietly while you hold him. Ask your vet if this would be okay.

, Injuries can often take several months to heal, leaving you in rehabilitation mode for a significant period of time. Continue checking in with your vet to discuss how your horse's injury is improving, and what you can do to help.

Sweep the floor.,
Wait for at least an hour to bring your horse back in.,
Consider whether the stall is adjacent to the arena.",How to Prevent Heaves in Horses," Pasture time is key to preventing heaves in horses. The more time your horse spends out on pasture, the less he’ll be exposed to allergens inside his stable. In addition, he’ll get to eat plenty of grass, which is very healthy for him and won’t irritate his lungs.Keep your horse out on pasture as much as possible—all day, if you can.


Unfortunately, pasture time might increase the chances of heaves in some horses. If your horse has had pasture-associated heaves, keep him stabled until winter.;
, Horses will often bury their faces directly in the round bale and then inhale the dust particles while they are eating. While you may be tempted to feed your horses this way because it is so easy, it is not good for your horse’s airways., As a horse’s airways become irritated, the body will increase mucus production in the airways which further traps allergens and irritants. By feeding from the floor, gravity will help drain the mucus and keep your horse more comfortable., Hay has a lot of dust and is a common culprit of heaves in horses. If you want to prevent heaves in your horse, take hay out of his diet, particularly round bale hay. Compared with other types of forage, round bale hay has higher amounts of dust, mold, and other allergens.A horse will bury his nose in the bale and breathe in those allergens.Even good-quality hay contains dust.If you decide to feed your horse hay, soak it in water for up to 30 minutes to decrease its dust levels.Throw away any uneaten soaked hay, since it could develop mold when it dries out.Rolled grains can also be dusty, so do not feed these to your horse., If it is not practical to remove hay from your horse’s diet, you could steam it. A hay steamer heats up hay to a temperature (212 degrees F/100 degrees C) high enough to kill mold and fungus. Hay steamers produce water during the steaming process. Drain the water between uses and keep the steamer in a warm place during the winter so the water doesn’t freeze.Discuss hay steaming with your veterinarian before investing in a hay steamer, as steaming can remove some vital nutrients from hay.

, In winter, there won’t be much grass for your horse to eat. A commercially available pelleted feed is low in dust, which will help prevent heaves.Your vet can recommend which pelleted feed to give your horse. A low-dust diet is important for preventing heaves.


The term 'complete' indicates the feed contains all the required nutrients in the proper amounts.
In the warmer months, you could also supplement the grass with the pelleted feed if your horse isn’t getting enough calories from pasture alone., Other than pelleted feed and grass, foods such as alfalfa cubes, alfalfa pellets, and silage are low in dust.Alfalfa is a type of hay that horses really like. The cubed or pelleted forms of alfalfa are unlikely to cause heaves in horses.

, Adequate ventilation is essential to lowering the allergen count in your horse’s stable. An easy way to improve ventilation is to keep the stable windows and doors open as much as possible, even in cold weather.If your horse gets cold, put a well-fitting blanket over him.Other ventilation strategies are available:Strategically place fans in the stable so they recirculate the air but do not blow dust particles back into the air. It may take some trial and error to determine where to place the fans.
Install vents or windows in the roof so warm air can escape. Consider installing ridge vents, which run the length of a roof.
If you are not comfortable doing the ventilation work yourself, work with a professional builder to improve the stable’s ventilation.

, In addition to ventilation, low-dust bedding will help keep allergens out of the air. Chopped paper and chopped cardboard are good low-dust beddings for horse stalls. Do not use straw bedding—it is very high in dust.Rubber mats are another good bedding choice. Put just enough bedding in the stall on top of the rubber mat to absorb urine.If you have more than one horse, place low-dust bedding in all of the stalls.Horses need much less bedding than most people believe. Reducing the amount of bedding also reduces the dust content circulating in the stall.

, Storing hay in the upper level of your stable may be convenient. However, that hay would be a constant source of allergens into the air, increasing the risk of heaves in your horse. It is very important not to store hay in the stable’s loft!Place the hay in a separate weatherproof building, such as a storage trailer., Clutter can accumulate dust. Identify and remove unused items or items that don’t need to be stored in the stable. If needed items are collecting dust, wipe them down with a damp cloth to remove the dust.


Be aware that removing the clutter will lessen only the visible dust.There may still be dust and other particles lingering the air that you won’t be able to see.

, If you have an arena, your horse could kick up a lot of particles when exercising and training in the arena. If the arena footing is made of sand, dampen the sand to prevent it from flying into the air.Alternatively, you could reduce dust by adding a special coated sand on top of the sand footing., A clean stable is key to preventing heaves. Because cleaning can stir up a lot of dust and other air particles, it is best to keep your horse out on pasture during the cleaning process., Mucking a horse stall involves removing feces and replacing the bedding. A pitchfork is useful for cleaning out the stall. If anything falls through the slats of the pitchfork, pick it up with a shovel. Damp spots on the stall floor indicate urine—clean up these spots with an absorbent deodorizer to remove the irritating smell of ammonia.If you don’t see damp spots right away, inspect the entire stall for the scent of ammonia. Consider putting your head where your horse’s head would go.You may be surprised where you end up smelling ammonia.

, Sweeping a dry floor will put dust and other particles into the air. Sprinkle the floor with water before sweeping.Do not use a leaf blower to clean the floors, since it could blow a lot of dust into the air.Do not sweep the floor frequently., Cleaning your horse’s stable, even with dampening the floor before sweeping, can put a lot of dust in the air. In fact, the cleaning process can increase the amount of airborne dust to 16 times above normal!It will take about an hour for all of the dust to settle back down to the floor, so keep your horse out on pasture for at least an hour after you’ve finished cleaning., If the areas are connected, be sure to wet down the arena to reduce the amount of dust that is recirculated through the rest of the barn. You can do this by hand with a hose, or have a professional install an irrigation system above your indoor arena."

Ask an experienced horse person to help out.If you're reading this article, you likely don't have a lot of experience with giving injections.,

Draw back on the needle before every injection.,
Connect the syringe to the needle.,
Address any bleeding.,
Dispose of the needle and syringes responsibly.",How to Give a Horse an Injection," It's a good idea to have someone to help you — either an experienced horse person or your veterinarian. You should certainly have an experienced professional supervise you the very first time you give an injection. If your veterinarian can't make the trip, see if a vet tech can help you out.;
, A needle-shy horse will be able to tell what you're up to, even if he can't see the needle! He'll act up even before getting the shot because he knows what's coming and wants to prevent it. These behaviors can include rearing, biting, and kicking. For everyone's safety in this situation, it's best to have a professional do the job.


If you lack experience, you could end up hurting the horse, even if you escape injury yourself. There's a good chance the needle could bend, possibly while still in the horse. This could damage the horse's muscle, and might even call for surgical removal.

, For example, some horse tranquilizers can cause respiratory arrest (stop breathing) in humans.

, Even sticking the needle through a stopper on a medicine bottle dulls the point a bit. This, in turn, makes the injection more painful for the horse. The needle needs to be as sharp as possible to penetrate the horse's skin quickly and easily. If you encounter a needle-shy horse, he may be that way because of the pain associated with a blunt needle in the past.

, Because muscles have a good blood supply, the medicine is absorbed into the blood stream nicely.


Some medications may sting when given IM. The packaging for these products might recommend against giving the medicine through an IM shot. On the other hand, some IM injections contain preservatives that are not suitable for injection into a blood vessel.
It's not likely you'll have to give an intravenous injection. Do not attempt one, though, unless you are a qualified veterinarian or vet tech.

, The two most common sites for giving an injection are the neck and hindquarters. Either site is fine — location is largely a matter of your personal preference. That said, it's best to inject skittish horses in the neck, as you can't get kicked from that position. The large muscle of the hindquarters are better if you need to deliver a large volume of medication (10 ml or more), though.Always check with your vet or the directions on the medication packaging for the recommended injection site.

, The person helping you (the handler) should stand on the same side as of the horse as you. The horse's head should be slightly turned toward the handler. This decreases the chances of someone getting run over or stepped on if the horse reacts badly during the injection process.


It's best not to tie the horse. A big physical reaction could hurt either the horse or the handlers, or damage the equipment.

, Have your handler speak soothingly to the horse while you position yourself by the injection site.If the horse remains restless, try using a twitch to keep him still during the injection. While it may look uncomfortable, a twitch is perfectly safe and humane, and is widely used to ease stress in horses. The most common type of twitch is a loop of rope attached to a pole.


Place the horse's upper lip in the loop of rope.
Tighten the loop by rotating the pole round and round.
This gentle compression of the upper lip has a calming effect, like when a mother cat picks up a kitten by the scruff.
It is best to have your handler operate the twitch, leaving your hands free to give the injection.

, One of your main concerns when injecting a horse should be the safety of all involved. When injecting at the neck, you stand in a fairly safe position beside the horse's shoulder — far from kicking back hooves. You also have more control of the horse, as well, since you're by his head. All told, neck injections just provide a safer environment than hindquarter injections, and are a good option.

, Locate the triangle between the point of the horse's shoulder and the slope of the shoulder blade. The upper side of the triangle is the ""nuchal ligament"" — the arc of muscle along the top of the horse's neck. The lower side of the triangle is formed by the neck bones as they snake upwards from the shoulder in an ""S"" shape.


To find this triangle, put the heel of your hand against the front of the horse's shoulder, about a third of the way up the neck.
Where your palm rests is the safe place to give the injection.

, If you give the injection too high up the neck, the medicine will enter the nuchal ligaments that hold the head up. This is extremely painful for the horse, and will continue to cause him pain every time he moves his head. But if you go too low, the needle may glance off the bones of the neck vertebra, which is also painful for the horse.


You could also hit the jugular vein if you go too low. If you're delivering a medication unsuitable for intravenous use, the horse could die.

, This injection site is more effective than the neck, but also more dangerous because you have to stand closer to the back end and the danger of being kicked. However, the hindquarters are the preferred location if you have to deliver a large volume of medication (10 ml or more). For example, penicillin comes in large doses.

, Your target muscle for this type of injection is the ""semitendinosus muscle,"" which is at the very back of the horse's rump. Imagine a horse sitting down like a dog — the semitendinosus muscle is the one he would sit on. In foals, this is one of the largest muscles in the body, which adds to its appeal for IM injections.

, Begin by finding the point of the buttocks (the bony bit far back on the pelvis). Drop an imaginary vertical line down to the ground, along the back of the leg. You will give the injection into the bulging muscle located along this line.


Take care to inject into the muscle, not into the ""dip"" where the muscle buts against a neighboring one.
The ""dip"" is low in blood vessels. Medicine injected there will not be absorbed well, and will be less effective.

, But, the blood supply to this area isn't particularly good, so medicine may be less effective when injected there. Furthermore, if an abscess forms at the needle site, it can be hard to drain off and get rid of.


Only inject in the top of the rump if you have no other options.

, Some people like to tap the horse a few times at the injection site, but this is a bad idea. Taps are fast, punch-like blows given with the heel of the hand before the needle's inserted. Some believe it numbs the skin so the horse won't feel the needle. But, tapping only warns the horse that something is about to happen — especially if you've used that technique before. The horse will be calmer if he doesn't know what's about to happen.

, When you first insert the needle, you want to do it without the medicine attached to it. This will allow you to ""draw back"" and make sure you've placed the needle accurately.

, Using a sharp, new, sterile needle for each injection, push the needle into the muscle in a smooth, confident motion. The needle should form a 90° angle with the muscle. Insert the needle all the way up to the hub (the part where the metal needle joins onto the syringe).

, Many medications can be dangerous for the horse if delivered into a blood vessel. In worst case scenarios, it can result in death. To avoid this, always ""draw back"" before giving an injection. This simple action makes sure your needle is in the muscle, not a blood vessel.


Once you've inserted the needle into the injection site, pull back on the syringe plunger a little bit.
If the needle is in a blood vessel, you'll see blood getting pulled into the needle hub (the bit left sticking out of the skin).
Remove the needle and do NOT inject.
Use a new, sharp needle to find the injection site again, then repeat the drawing back process until you're confident you're in the right place.

, Draw back on the plunger one more time to double-check for the presence of blood. If all is clear, then press steadily onto the plunger to give the injection. Once the syringe is empty, withdraw the syringe and needle together.

, A blob of blood might form in the needle hole in the horse's skin. If so, apply gentle pressure with a ball of cotton wool for at least two minutes. By that time, the bleeding should have stopped, but if not, keep holding the wool against the wound until it does.

, Once used, they're considered ""clinical waste,"" which means you can't just throw them in the trash. You have to dispose of them in a way approved by local authorities.


Store used needles and syringes in a plastic container with a lid. An empty ice-cream tub or similar container will be just fine.
Give the container to your veterinarian for safe disposal at the clinic.
Make sure to keep the container out of reach from children while the needles are in your care.

Check if the horse struggles with certain movements during training.,
Notice if the horse appears hot and fatigued after a long training session.,
Make sure you warm up the horse before a training session.",How to Diagnose the Cause of Fatigue in Horses1," You should observe the horse during physical training and notice if it struggles during any movements or tricks. If your horse has difficulties with certain movements, this may be a sign that it is not as strong in certain muscle areas as it could be, and this could lead to fatigue. You should try to include more training that uses muscles on your horse that appear weak or underdeveloped.If you are not already doing physical training with your horse, you should do so, as physical training can help your horse get used to exercising its muscles. This can help to combat fatigue later on.;
, You should pay attention to how the horse feels after a long training session. Place your hand on your horse and feel if it is very hot the touch. This is a sign it may be overheating due to physical strain and needs to be cooled down. You may then dump buckets of cold water on the horse, scrape it off with a sponge, and then reapply it again.You should also notice this issue when your horse does intensive physical activity, such as endurance racing or hunting. Horses tend to get more fatigued after doing these kinds of activities and you should do your best to cool the horse down so it does not get overheated and overtired., Most horses do well with a 10 minute warm up session before you start any physical training with them. A warmed up horse will perform better during physical training and be less likely to develop fatigue. If you do not warm up your horse before training, this may be a contributing factor to the horse’s fatigue.Try to get in the habit of warming up your horse before training with a 10 minute trot around the stable or the grounds. Doing this could prevent fatigue.

Recognize that every horse is different.,
Gauge the start according to how fit your horse is.,
Learn pacing, another important aspect.,
Look at the fences.,

Skinnies - These are very narrow jumps, designed to challenge the rider.,

Owl holes - These can be some of the most tricky jumps on a course.",How to Ride a Cross Country Course on Horseback," A more willing horse can certainly help while riding cross country.;
, For example, if your horse is not overly fit you don't want to be going bull at a gate, since this will mean your horse feels 'energy sapped' towards the last fences. This can be dangerous.

, Pacing is very hard to teach, as again it depends on your horse. Aim for a pace that your horse is comfortable with. Often this is more of a quicker canter rather than a gallop. Aim to help your horse into a nice 'rolling' pace. Strides should be longer than your average 17 feet (5.2 m) canter stride, but to the point. The back legs should be engaged, not trailing along behind.

, There are many many different type of cross country fences. Some fences will require you to set the horse up. Others, such as hedges and palisades can be jumped more often than not out of your current stride.


Water Fences. These don't appear on all courses, but should be treated with caution. Make sure you check the depth and footing EVERYWHERE when walking the course. Just in case the worst should happen, you need to make sure it's safe. You will need a lot of energy when approaching a water fence, so aim to get the horse/pony back on their hocks a little, also make sure you sit very defensively - you don't want to take a dunk!






Ditches - These tend to cause problems! If your horse doesn't like ditches, practice, practice, practice! As the rider, don't look into the ditch. Usually the horse is in tune with your motions and will also look at the ditch!






Benches and Table - These are shaped like solid picnic tables and benches, and many horses will spook at these objects. Take care when going over, and never approach it from the wrong side.






Corner jumps - These are shaped like an open triangle, and should be approached at the narrowest end.






Roll tops - These jumps have a big 'spook' factor. They are quite wide and long, so should only be approached by experienced riders.






Drop fence - These can lead to a drop onto ground or water. These are very hard to jump, and should only be approached by experienced horses and riders, with someone watching, due to the fact that there is little way of 'spooking' without someone or something getting hurt. For this riders should lean back when in midair in preparation for the fall below, with the heels down to absorb shock. Allow the horse lots of rein.







, These can be difficult to get over due to their small size, and whether the horse is co-operative or not.






Pheasant feeder - This jump is a tricky jump, and it looks like an elongated roof. Because both sides are stretched out, horses can easily misjudge landing positions, so much care should be taken.






Tyre jumps - These are simply lots of tires staked against each other around a long pole. These are generally small, but exciting and spooky to jump.






Spreads - These are jumps consisting of several poles or logs placed near each other, gradually getting higher. These are difficult to jump, and should ONLY be approached from the side where the smallest pole starts.






Simple jumps - These range from simple logs, to verticals, to fences, to bushes. The easiest to jump, and can also be the most exciting.






Novelty jumps - These can cause even the safest horse to spook, as they can be shaped like 'scary' objects such as: Houses, Mushrooms, Haycarts, Stables and more. These can be wide or long, big or little, but should be jumped with care.







, They appear on courses less often, and are shaped as big hedges or fences with a wide hole in the middle. These can vary in size, but are extremely difficult to jump due to being very high on a horses spook factor. They will usually be at the end or beginning of a course, and should only be attempted if your horse is reliable, safe, you are confident, and there is someone there supervising.

Look at how much water the horse drinks.,
Check that the horse’s diet contains fat.,
Think about how often you feed the horse.",How to Diagnose the Cause of Fatigue in Horses2," Notice if your horse drinks enough water before any intense or prolonged training. It should be well hydrated so it does not become fatigued. You should also make sure it gets enough water when it is performing in a hot environment, as this can prevent overheating.If you notice your horse appears fatigued mid training or during intense exercise, you should stop the horse and make sure it drinks water. You may also move the horse to a shady area so it can cool down while it rehydrates., You may want to add fat to the horse’s diet during prolonged periods of exercise, as added fat affects your horse’s response to exercise. Your horse may have a more stable body temperature and be less likely to get overheated or feel fatigued.One option is to feed your horse vegetable oil at a rate of 100 to 120 grams per kilogram of weight before a long training session.

, You should feed your horse small portions every four hours leading up to a competition or a race. This can help to ensure your horse has enough energy for the event but is not feeling too heavy or bogged down by food.You should also reduce the fiber intake of the horse, as this can decrease fatigue in the horse, and avoid giving the horse a large meal one to two hours before a competition or race.
Make sure your horse is not overweight, as this can lead to fatigue during intense exercise or training. You should monitor your horse’s weight to ensure it does not weigh too much for its breed.

Allow the vet to do a physical exam.,
Discuss the diagnosis with the vet.,
Determine your treatment options.",How to Diagnose the Cause of Fatigue in Horses3," The most definitive way to diagnose the cause of your horse’s fatigue is to get your vet to do a physical exam of your horse. You may ask your vet to do a house call to examine your horse or bring the horse to the vet.Your vet may do a full physical exam of the horse, noting the horse’s behavior when it walks or moves around.
They may also ask you questions about the horse’s training routine, diet, and level of fluid intake to determine the cause of the horse’s fatigue.

, The vet should be able to diagnose the horse and tell you the cause of the horse’s fatigue. You should ask the vet if the cause is chronic and needs intensive treatment or if the cause is easy to treat and address.Depending on your horse’s symptoms, it may simply be suffering from poor diet and dehydration. In some cases, your horse may have a more serious medical issue such as chronic fatigue, a genetic disorder or fibromyalgia.

, Your vet will recommend certain treatment options based on your horse’s diagnosis. You will need to follow the vet’s instructions and make sure the horse receives the necessary care so the issue can be resolved.


Your vet may recommend changes in the horse’s diet and training routine to prevent fatigue in the future.
If your horse has a more serious medical issue, such as chronic fatigue, you may need to give the horse a saline solution or other medication to address the issue.

Sit deeply.,
Align your body.,
Distribute your weight evenly.,
Keep your arms flexible.",How to Improve Balance While Riding a Horse1," Once you have mounted, you can start to find your balance. Sit in the lowest part of the saddle.Do not lean too far forward or back or your balance may be off. If the horse won’t stand still, you can have another person hold the reins while you mount and find your balance.;
, Place your feet in the stirrups, with the balls of your feet pressed against the stirrups and your heels pointed towards the ground. Your legs should not be in front of your body. Imagine a straight line drawn down through your ears, shoulders, hips, and heels.Your body should not be rigid. Make sure you’re sitting up straight and keeping your shoulders relaxed. Allow your body to communicate with the horse so that you can adjust your balance as you ride. Do not arch your back or hunch.You may find it helpful to have someone take a photo of you in the saddle so you can see and analyze your own alignment. This allows you and your trainer to critique how you’re sitting and make any changes.

, Do not rest your weight entirely on your seat or tail bones. Instead, allow your whole body to help you maintain your position on the horse. Keep your shoulders rolled back and your gaze looking forward to keep this posture.It may be tempting to squeeze the horse with your thighs, calves, or knees. Instead of pressing in on the horse with one part of your leg, each part of your leg should have an even amount of contact with the horse., If you do not have strong balance on a horse, you may be tempted to clench the reins or hold them tightly to yourself. This interferes with the communication between you and the horse. Instead, hold your elbows so that they line up with the horse’s mouth. Hold the reins tightly enough to control the horse, but do not yank or restrict the horse’s movements."

Refresh yourself with the many cues of asking a horse to move forward.,
Make sure you aren't making any barriers to keep the horse from moving forward.,
Relax yourself and clear your mind, look where you want to go, connect with the horse's mouth, let your legs long, and hug the horse with your legs.,
If your horse won't move straight forward, trick the horse into just moving by starting the horse in a different direction.,
Keep repeating the steps until your horse will move forward when asked.",How to Make a Horse Move Forward," Different disciplines have different cues, and between riders there are tons of different cues they'll use. Below are some of the most common ones; try them and try to determine which cues work best for your horse.


Hugging your legs around the horse, sometimes rocking forward in the saddle
Connecting with the horse's mouth, getting his attention, then lifting the reins up and forward
Making kissing or clucking noises (careful: this is also a cue for a horse to speed up into a trot or canter)
Looking forward. Horses are incredibly sensitive animals and can tell where you're looking and where your focus is from the subtle difference your body position will have.;
, Are you pulling the reins back or leaning back while asking the horse to move forward? Make sure you aren't sending confusing cues to the horse.


Once certain that you aren't sending confusing cues, move on to the next step.

, If you ride Western you can lift the reins up and forward towards the horse's head. When you hug the horse with your legs, keep your legs long and squeeze with your calves. You may need to give the horse some mental inertia by rocking forward in the saddle a bit.

, Try backing up the horse and then having the horse move forward, or turning the horse and then riding in the direction you originally wanted to go. Once your horse becomes more willing to go straight, and to go where you're asking, begin asking your horse to walk off straight.


The #1 rule of riding horses: the horse can't go any farther than the tip of his nose. If he will not move, tighten the reins on one side to make your horse turn his head. While doing that, hug your calves around the horse and ask the horse to move forward. First, make your horse move in small circles. Then, let your rein out a little bit, just enough to make the circles he is making a little bigger. Continue doing this until the circles are large. Then, straighten the horse out. There you are! Just try to teach your horse out of this step quickly or it may become a bad habit.

, This process should quickly train your horse, and you, teaching you both good habits.

Stand in the stirrups after mounting.,
Trot at a two-point position.,
Ride without stirrups.,
Lean in other directions.,
Stretch in the saddle.",How to Improve Balance While Riding a Horse2," Once you have positioned yourself correctly, you can try standing in the stirrups. Lift your weight so that you are not sitting on the saddle. This position will resemble a crouching position. It will automatically put you in the proper position for balanced riding. After a minute, try lowering yourself while carefully maintaining the proper leg position., Once you have gotten the hang of standing in your stirrups, you can try riding in this position as well. Trot the horse around the ring while crouching in the two-point position. This is a very good exercise for building leg muscle and improving your balance. Start with five or ten minute sessions, and work your way up to thirty or forty minute sessions.You can alternate your exercises by alternating a two point form with sitting. Try doing seven paces sitting and seven paces in two-point., By riding without stirrups, you will automatically learn how to balance yourself on a horse. It will teach your muscles how to grip the horse without additional aids. Hold your feet the same way you would in the stirrups, with the heels pointed down. Practice sitting in this manner before you start moving.You don’t need to remove the stirrups in order to do this. You can achieve the same effect by crossing the stirrups over the saddle to the opposite side.
When you are starting out, you can have someone hold the horse on a long line. If it helps, hold onto your saddle with a few fingers, and practice riding around a ring for ten minutes at a time.If the horse is not yours or if you do not know the horse you are riding well enough, you may want to try riding with stirrups first before removing them.

, This exercise can promote mobility on the horse’s back while still keeping you balanced in the saddle. While sitting in the saddle, try reaching forward to touch the horse's ears. Next lean back and touch your horse's rump. Now lean side to side, and just touch the horse as you go. Keep on talking to the horse, and experiment with leaning in different directions.


Once you have start building up your balance, you can try this exercise while in two-point position., Once you have finished your exercises on your horse, don’t forget to stretch. While still sitting in your saddle, point your toes in the ground to stretch your calves and thighs. If you were using stirrups, be sure to drop them before doing this stretch.You can also stretch out your arms, and rotate them in circles to relieve tension and help you relax."
"
Build core muscles.,
Strengthen your legs.,
Learn yoga.",How to Improve Balance While Riding a Horse3," The core muscles are those in your abdomen and back. Core strength will help you stabilize the proper upper body posture on the horse while giving you extra control over your body movements. You should do between ten and twenty reps of these exercises. Some good core exercises for riders include:



One Leg Extension: Lay down on your back. Bend your knees, and keep your feet hips-width apart. Place your hands on your stomach. Raise your head slightly off the floor. Lift one leg up, keeping it straight. Hold for a few breaths before lowering and lifting the other leg.Full Body Curl: Lay down on the floor with your knees bent. At the same time, lift your head, shoulders, and feet off the floor, bringing your knees towards your chin. Straighten your body until your head, shoulders, and feet are flat on the ground again.

Plank: Lay on your belly and then push your body up so that only your forearms and toes touch the floor. Tighten your core and keep your back straight. Hold this position for one minute and then take a quick rest before repeating a few more times.

Bicycle Crunch: Lift your legs until they are 45 degrees from the floor. Bend one knee, and hold the other one straight. Raise your shoulders and head off the ground, and touch your opposite elbow to your knee. Lower your head to the ground. Straighten your leg, and bend the other one. Repeat., To improve your grip, balance, and control over the horse, leg exercises are important. Any exercise that works your thighs or calves can help. For example, you can try:



Squats: Keep your back straight and your feet hip-width apart. Lower yourself to a 90-degree angle before slowly rising to a stand again. If you having difficulty, you can start by positioning yourself against a wall.Skipping: As you skip, push off with one foot and lift the other one high, until your thigh is horizontal. Reach across your body with your opposite arm. Repeat this movement on the opposite leg. You can do this around a track or around your neighborhood. Quad Stretch: Kneel on the ground with one leg bent in front of you. With your hands on your hips, gently move your hips forward. You should keep your back straight., Yoga helps your balance both on and off the horse. It also keeps you relaxed, encouraging you to keep a more flexible posture while riding. You can attend a yoga class, watch videos on the internet, or try the following moves.



Warrior Pose: Stand straight. Stretch your right foot back behind you as far as you can; this will naturally put you in a lunge position. Stretch your arms straight above your head. Take about five breaths, and repeat with the other leg.Spinal Twist: Sit with your spine straight, and your shoulders lined up with your hips. Stretch your legs in front of you so that they are flat against the ground. Bend one leg, and place it over the other. Wrap the opposite arm around the bent knee, and twist your body. Hold this pose for five breaths before repeating on the other side.Pilates and ballet are other great options if you want to improve your core strength and balance."

Make sure you have access to a horse, pony, or mule.,
Select an event or style of riding that you like, or you think you might like.,
Learn about dressage.,
Try Cross-Country riding.,
Try Eventing.,
Do Rodeo Riding.,
Do Barrel Racing.,
Try Hacking.,
Try In-Hand.,
Do Hunter Riding.,
Do Trail Riding.,
Decide which event is best suited for you and your horse.,
Look at what equipment you already have available.,
Buy new equipment if you need to.,
Go to a show.,
Finalize your decision.",How to Choose a Riding Style or Equestrian Discipline," This way you can decide what your horses attributes are and what it's downfalls are. If you ride school horses or loan a horse, it is probably already trained for a particular style or discipline, and many riding schools only teach certain disciplines such as Dressage, Show Jumping and Western. In other cases riding schools have many horses that can be ridden in different styles, such as Show Jumping and Western etc.;
, It doesn't hurt to experiment with a discipline. This is what helps you decide if you're going to be the next Olympic Show Jumper or you simply prefer a laid back Trail Ride. There are a lot of styles and below are the general disciplines and styles with brief explanations about each. For information about any of the following or other disciplines or events, you should seek advice from a local riding school in your area as riding disciplines vary from area to area.

, Remember dressage is a French term meaning Training, this discipline is the basis for many, if not all of the other styles and disciplines. Simply doing a 20 meter (65.6 ft) circle in your back yard is dressage, you are performing a set task within the 20 meters (65.6 ft). Dressage can be done for fun at many riding schools, and as you improve the tests increase in difficulty as do the required moves.

Dressage starts at Introductory then moves to Training Level, First Level, Second Level, Third Level, Fourth Level and then on to FEI. The tests begin with walk, trot, halt and simple shapes (like 20m circles), and on the 1st-4th levels you will add in extensions, medium gates, flying changes, lateral work, and the beginning of pirouettes. All horses are capable of the lower levels, as they just require basic walk, trot, canter and larger circles.







Try some show jumping. This discipline is exactly what is says, you ride a set course of show jumps at a particular height, gradually progressing higher as you get better and more advanced. The course usually consists of changes of direction, and can have as many or as few jumps as can fit in the space available. The rounds are timed, with the best time winning. You get time faults for rails knocked down.
The jumps vary in difficulty, from small cross poles to oxers and spreads through to Jokers and Parallel Fences. Different countries call the jumps different names but all the fences are the same. This discipline is not for the faint hearted and is a lot of fun.







, Have you ever dreamed of galloping over a huge field jumping effortlessly over logs and cantering though streams and down ditches. Well, don't dream anymore! This event is very similar to Show jumping, though it is a little less restricted to a small area. The jumps are wider spaced and made to not fall down.

Cross-Country jumps are set further apart and this means a better memory of the order. The jumps are numbered and as the course progresses the fences change from easier logs to water jumps, and ditches. Many times you can finish a course and want to do it all over again, though while riding your heart is in your throat and many times you don't realize that you're not breathing.
This is an exhilarating discipline and your horse must be very fit.







, This discipline is a combination of the above three disciplines. Riders are judged firstly at Dressage to demonstrate the training and capability of the horse and rider. Next the combination are to ride the cross-country course, this tests stamina, fitness, and bravery. Finally they are judged in Show jumping, this assess the ability to come back to a controlled speed and perform the tight turns and stamina to complete the final leg of the discipline.

Eventing is also known as Three Day Eventing (3DE), although many of the lower levels are held in one day.







, You have probably seen Rodeo riders cutting cows and tagging steers. The ladies will barrel race and bend around poles, while the males bronc ride and rope. This event is fast and dusty, the horses are fit and trained for speed. The riders dress for success in sponsored shirts and rodeo chaps, all riding in western saddles.

Many riders travel around the States and Australia competing in Rodeo Competitions all seeking the same thing, the High Point Award for there chosen field of Rodeo Riding. This discipline is not for the Faint Hearted but if you like speed and being in the spotlight, this event is for you.







, This event is mainly seen at Rodeo Events, but is also run on its own. The combination are required to ride a clover leaf pattern around three barrels. Many states require the pattern to be ridden on a right hand, whereas others can choose from a right or a left hand pattern. This event is fast and requires a lot of skill in being able to stay in the saddle as you gallop from one barrel to the next. If you enjoy riding for fun and like fast paced riding, this event is for you.

, In England, a Hack is referred to as a leisurely ride through paddocks and lane ways, it is a way to ride a horse out of a show ring its informal and a lot of fun its great for the laid back rider who does not wish to compete . In Australia it is referred to as a Show Riding Horse.

The horse is trained to be able to walk, trot, canter and hand-gallop (Extend Canter) with a high to medium head carriage with presence and alertness. Horses are also required to complete a set workout which also includes extensions, rein backs, and change of direction, which are asked as a simple change (canter to trot back to canter), flying change or a walk through (canter or trot to walk and back to the required pace) .
This event is similar to Dressage, but the riders and horses are a little more showier and their attire is much higher and the horses are spotless. This event requires a lot of ability as a rider and handler. If you ride a Pony, a Galloway or a Hack, your able to hack, the event is judged in height classes as well as rider age groups.







, This event is good for those who may have an unbroken horse, or if a rider is unable to ride for any reason. Similar to a Hack event, the horse and rider and judged on the capability and ability to handle and complete the set workout. In-hand showing is available for nearly all breeds from Arabians and Welsh and Native Ponies, through to your Western #*Breeds such as Appaloosa and Quarter Horses as well as to Warmbloods and Draft horses.



Western Pleasure and Western Events. All about the sparkles and the glitz and glamour. Appaloosas, Paints and Quarter Horses are mainly used, although Arabians are also used in western riding as well as a lot of other breeds. The horses are trained to be a pleasure to ride and throughout the years have been trained as peanut pushers to the older style to know, having a straight line across the neck form wither to poll, and working from the back end.
This event is judged on both horse and rider, and isn't as easy as it looks. Riders are asked to walk, Jog (slow trot) and lope (a slow, 3 beat canter, many horses 4 beat, and this is unnecessary and often marked down. Western riding also incorporates the events such as Trail, where the horse and rider are required to ride a course of obstacles often seen on the trail such as poles, bridges and opening a gate. Other western events include Reining, Western Riding, Showmanship (a halter event) as well as halter. Also Horsemanship and Equitation.
The ladies wear shiny glitzy outfits and the males wear trendy shirts with neck ties or bolos. The horses are ridden in Western Saddles, and Western bridles, either bitted up, snaffled or bosoled. One handed or two handed depending on the age and degree of training. This event requires both skill and ability, in being able to control your horse without the use of your reins and being able to sit quietly and elegantly.







, This event is also seen at Appaloosa, Quarter Horse and Paint Horse Shows, this style of riding is often referred to as the English Western. The horse is ridden two handed in an English bit. Riders wear English Jacket and breeches with tall field boots, and often ride in an All Purpose, or a close contact Saddle.

Though an English event horses are required to travel with a bit more upbeat pace, while maintaining the light contact on the rein and easy paces. Other Hunter events include Hunter Under Saddle and Hunt Seat Equitation.







, Also known as Hacking in England, a quiet horse is needed, and riders ride alone or in groups along bridle paths, in open fields or in hills and forests. This style of riding is relaxed and easy going, and often a great discipline for riders unable to go very fast or who ride an older horse that may be semi-retired.

, You should research into local riding schools that may cater for the particular style you wish to try. If there are no schools that teach it, you need to look into getting lessons from a qualified coach or teacher, who is proficient in the event. A Rider who competes in the event isn't a good choice, as they may be riding a well-trained horse and often are unable to answer the questions asked.

, You may have an English saddle and a few poles laying around the paddock, or you might have a paddock with a river or stream and some fallen logs. You can ride incorporating these things to get the feel of the discipline you wish to try or ride.

, At some time you will need to buy the required equipment and saddlery if you are really interested in the discipline. If you're starting out or you are figuring out what style of riding you want to do, look into second hand saddles. In the case of Western, (all other events can be ridden in an English saddle), a training saddle is also good. You can eventually buy a new saddle when you are sure of the event and riding you're going to do. You can also borrow a saddle or equipment if able to from a friend, ask their permission before taking it.

, once you have all the right equipment, go to a show or event of the same discipline. Many shows and events have beginner or lower levels. You can ride and get the feel of the show, and what happens during the day. You will also meet a lot of nice people who will be happy to help with any questions. You may also meet some not so nice people, stay clear of them and try to be nice.

, this is both a milestone for you and your riding career. Many times you will want to buy a new piece of equipment so as you look better and perform better, this may include a new saddle, or a new bridle, a new piece of clothing, or simply a back number holder, or a set of spurs to help you ride better.

To others it may seem nothing, but this is the first step into your new career of riding in your chosen field. Your discipline choice may change as you improve or change to unforeseen circumstances such as your horse getting injured or you getting too tall for your horse. You may also move into a higher group or level that you are not happy with and choose to try something new.
You may also choose a new discipline if you want a change of pace. e.g. Pony Club to Show jumping to Western back to Dressage. You can also do more than one, such as Western and Dressage, or Eventing (all three).

Consider which party approach you'll take.,
If you want to hold the party at a horse riding place, you'll need to find one that can handle both the party preparations and the riding.,
If you want to hold the party at your own home and take the girls to the event, think about the travel arrangements.,
If holding the party in your own place, decide which of your horses are safe for different riding capabilities.,
Get permission from all parents for their children to ride horses.,
Decide when and how the guests will ride the horses.,
Consider the need for horse riding hats.,
Make or purchase invitations.,
Add all of the needed details to the invitation.,
Mail out or send the invitations well before the party.,
Prepare the decorations.,
Choose some games.,
Make food for the party.,
If the party is to finish with a sleepover, choose horse related movies for the movie part of the night.,
Have a program of events and times so that you stay within the time allowed for everything.,
When the guests are horse riding, keep an eye on everyone.,
Follow the horse riding with a quiet activity or food.,
Hand out goodie bags at the end of the party.",How to Host a Horse Riding Party," You'll need to decide whether you want the party to be completely at a horse riding ranch or place or you would like to have the party at your house but include taking the guests to a local horse riding place as part of the event.


Alternatively, if you have horses on your own property, you can combine both the horse riding and the comfort of your home.;
, Alternatively, they might give you a space and let you do the setting up yourself. Call local horse riding places and see what they are prepared to offer.

,


You'll need to get the guests to and from the farm, ranch or place. Perhaps some parents will be happy to carpool and take a few guests per car.
Get parental permission for traveling to and from the place.

, If you have beginner riders, either provide a horse that is great with learners or a pony. If you don't have such a horse, you'll need to prepare some of the guests in advance for not having a horse ride but still participating in the party.


You don't always need your own horses. Some child entertainers can provide traveling pony rides in some areas. Check the Yellow Pages or online for this possibility. Provided there is a suitable area to ride (your garden, a nearby park, etc.), this would remain the responsibility of the provider and all you need to do is set a time and provide payment.

, Do not assume it is okay without permission; ask well ahead.

, Work out when the horse riding will form part of the party. How long will the horses be ridden for, and to where? Will it just be a fun tour of the garden or a big circle, or will it be a full ride to somewhere on the property? The choice will depend on the skill levels and ages of the guests.

, If the guests don't have their own, can some be borrowed from the horse riding place?

, If buying them, look for horse designs. If making the invitation, a horse shape is ideal, or a saddle, horseshoe or just the horse's head. Or, use the silhouette or a girl or boy wearing a horse riding hat.

, Ask the guests to ""saddle up"" and get ready for the horse riding party of the season! The details you'll need to add will include:


Party type and theme
Time, date and place
Explanation that the party involves horse riding. Hence, ask for parental permission, ask for level of experience with horse riding from the guest in advance of the party and inform the guests to bring riding clothes as well as party clothes
Transport requirements (if needed)
Any other relevant details
RSVP date, including your phone and email contact details.

, You will need sufficient time to get back parental permission and to ensure that all of the guests have told you about their riding abilities and have the right gear for horse riding.

, Obviously, as many horse-related decorations as possible is a great way to set the mood. Also choose a color theme, focused on the favorite color of the party person.

, If having some games, consider basing them on horse themes where possible. Some good choices include:


Horseshoes
Running and jumping races
Toss the hoop over the horse's head
Pin the tail on the horse
Decorating horse-shaped cookies
Races with hobby horses, etc.


Award prizes with horse show rosette ribbons. Horse show ribbons can be purchased online.







, For food, have such things as trail mix cookies, carrot stick snacks, horse shaped or horseshoe shaped cookies, cake pops, chips, etc.


For the party cake, make a horse-shaped cake. This could be a horse's head, a whole horse shape, a horse image piped or set onto the cake top, plastic horses roaming across a green frosting field on top of the cake, etc. If you're clever with sugar paste/fondant or royal icing, you might be able to shape the whole cake as a horse.

, There are many to choose from, such as Seabiscuit, Black Beauty, National Velvet, My Friend Flicka, The Silver Brumby, etc.

, The horse riding is probably best as one of the first activities, while everyone is bright and full of energy.

, Those who are waiting their turn will need to be kept amused; ask them to watch the others or entertain them with a game as they wait.


If the guests are riding off as a party, ensure that at least one adult from the party group is also going with the guests.

, Games can be left for later in the party, if you're having them.


If the party is also to be a sleepover, have the guests shower (in turns) before bedtime. It will ensure they're all clean and will also calm everyone down after the excitement and gives them a chance to soothe any sore muscles.

, Include a message, such as ""thanks for horsing around at my party"". Include a little plastic horse in the goodie bag and some sweet treats.

Younger children can be given a hobby horse to take home.

Assess how fit your horse actually is.,
Once you have assessed your horse, slot him in at the relevant level.

,
Starting with the very unfit horse lunge them for 5 - 10 minutes each side every other day for a week, then increase to 10 - 15 minutes each side for another week.Be careful you aren't stressing your horse as lunging can be stressful for your horse's joints.

,
After two weeks start riding your horse - Start slowly.,
School for about 20 - 30 minutes in an arena, then take him out for a light hack.,
Slowly increase the exercise over the new couple of weeks until your horse doesn't get tired when trotting for 15 minuets straight.

,
Experienced endurance trainers who have consistently had horses winning ""best condition"" give the horses a day off between rides, and when training for greater distances only ride three days per week.,
Start introducing slopes - only slight ones at first and walk up them.,
Work a little on canter.,
Find some good trail rides locally and see how long they are.,
Keep increasing your horse's work level - you will see a difference in him.,
As your horse gets fitter start timing yourself over distances.

",How to Condition Your Horse for Endurance Riding," Does he start puffing when you take him up a short slope?;
,,, You may want to alternate riding and lunging for a while. Work on transitions and circles.

, Start with basic roadwork at walk with a small amount of trot.

,, Plenty of rest between provides the tendons, joints, and equine physiology a good chance for healing and strengthening and also provides a refreshing mental reprieve and has proven positive physiologically and psychologically.

, After a few days start gently trotting part way up. Keep increasing until your horse can trot all the way up without getting too tired. You can then increase the speed of trot.

, Gradually extend your canter time until your horse is no longer huffing and puffing. It is VERY important that you go slow at this stage. Then you can start cantering up small to moderate hills. Next, you will be able to gallop. Don't gallop by yourself and make sure you always have a helmet and a safety vest on. I would advise gloves too, to protect your hands. Start with only a few strides, then increase.

, Start on the shorter ones and see how you and your horse cope with it - don't go hell for leather and charge round.

, Keep slowly increasing until he is fit enough to go for a long distance at any gait, with breaks every so often.

Mount your horse.,
Check the type of reins.,
Hold opposite sides of the reins.,
Wrap the rein around your first three fingers.,
Close your hands in a loose fist.,
Position your hands.,
Hold the reins at the right tension.,
Train your horse to obey ground-tying.,
Adapt your style for ranch work.,
Use reins in horse racing.",How to Hold a Horse's Reins," When mounting, you will often mount on the left side, because of the fact that most horses are used to being approached on this side. Pick up the reins with your left hand, put your left foot in the stirrup closest to you and then push yourself over the saddle (while still holding the reins). After mounting, your feet should already be in the stirrups.;
, In Western riding, riders usually use split reins, with one for each hand or they hold them with one hand. But in English riding, the reins are typically connected, forming a loop. The instructions below apply to both types except where noted.


Loop reins are the most common reins, except in Western riding, and are also used in dressage, jumping, polo, and horse racing.

, Start by holding one rein in each hand, or opposite sides of a loop rein. When you are a more experienced rider, you may learn to hold both split reins in one hand. For now, using both hands will give you more control over the horse.


Loop reins are always held with both hands, regardless of experience.

, Hold your palm flat. Loop the rein around your pointer, middle, and ring fingers. It should not wrap around your thumb or pinky.


Repeat this for your other hand as well.

, Hold the reins loosely, as though you were holding an ice cream cone. Turn your hands so your thumbs point up and slightly toward each other.

, Your hands should be approximately 10–15 centimeter (3.9–5.9 in) apart, and never further apart than the width of your horse's neck. Your hands have to be above your horses withers. Keep your hands relaxed and a little above the saddle, in front of the saddle pad. Your elbows have to be in an angle around 90°.

, You want just enough tension to maintain control, without restricting the horse's movements unnecessarily. It's better to hold them too loose than too tight, in order to avoid causing pain. Beginners should always use reins attached to a gentle bit, such as a snaffle bit with D rings. Horses with a harsher bit or sensitive muzzles may react with surprise and pain if the reins are tugged too hard.

, A cowboy's horse is often trained to stand still when the cowboy dismounts and puts one of the reins on the ground. This is called being ""ground-tied.""

, Experienced cowboys develop their own rapport with their horse, and may alter the reins or other elements of the tack. Generally, a cowboy performing ranch work will hold the reins in the left hand and allow them to hang somewhat loosely. This leaves the right hand free for roping cows or other work performed from horseback.

, Jockeys use the long, looped rein typical in English riding, with rubber grips for increased hold. In a horse race, the jockey pulls low and tight, so that the horse tucks his chin to his chest, in order to collect the horses gait and slow its gallop. This gives both horse and rider balance and allows the jockey a bit of leverage and control.

Clean all pet toys and bowls.",How to Make a Lemon Flea Spray," Making a homemade lemon flea spray is easy, and you don’t need a lot of ingredients or supplies. You will need several hours, however, because the lemons have to steep in the water overnight. The only supplies you'll need are:


Knife
Fork
Large pot with a lid
Strainer
Large bowl
Funnel
Large spray bottle;
, Slice the lemons into disks that are one-eighth inch (3 mm) thick.Place the slices into a large pot. Use a fork to mash the lemons a little so they release some of their juices.


The active ingredient in citrus fruits that deters and kills fleas is found in the rinds, and juicing the fruit with a fork will also help to break up the rinds.

, Add the water to the pot with the lemons. Put on the lid, and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. When the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and let the lemons simmer in the water for 30 minutes., When the lemons have simmered in the water for 30 minutes, remove the pot from the heat and set it aside. Let the lemons soak in the water overnight, or for about eight hours., When the lemon water has cooled and soaked overnight, remove the lemons from the water. Set a strainer over a bowl and pour the lemon water through the strainer.


Once the lemons have been strained, you can discard them.

, Pour the vinegar into the bowl with the lemon water and stir to combine. Place a funnel inside the neck of an open spray bottle, and pour the mixture into the bottle. Attach the spray top for easy application. Shake before each use.


The best vinegar to use in this recipe is either distilled white vinegar or apple cider vinegar., Fleas, eggs, and larvae can be found all over your house, and one of the best ways to get rid of them is by washing everything. This includes linens and bedding, towels, drapes, clothes, toys, and pet beds and mats. Run them through the washing machine using hot water.


When you dry the loads, use the highest temperature settings to ensure you kill everything., Use nozzles and attachments to get into nooks and corners. Dispose of the vacuum bag immediately after vacuuming. Vacuum everything you can, including:Carpets
Furniture
Beds
Floors
Cracks between hardwood floors
Along walls

, After washing and vacuuming, spray your entire house with your homemade lemon flea spray. Pay particular attention to furniture, drapes, and areas where your pet spends time.


For the first week, spray the house in the morning and in the evening.
Once the fleas are gone, continue spraying the house every few days to deter them from coming back.Be thoughtful in deciding where and how much of the lemon flea spray to use, because components of lemon rind can can be toxic to animals if ingested. Limit or avoid spraying areas and especially items that your pet might lick or chew.
Lemon juice is often used as a stain-removing ingredient, but it’s best to test the spray on an inconspicuous area of furniture and drapes to test for color-fastness. If the area isn't discolored by the lemon juice, spray the mixture liberally.

, Fleas also thrive in many outdoor areas, particularly in moist and shady places like tall grass, shrubs, trees, and leaves. Spray your flea spray in areas that fleas might like, and especially near entrances to the house and where pets or people play.You can also help prevent fleas by maintaining your yard, keeping the grass short, and not having bushes and shrubs near doors and windows.

, For this task you'll need a flea comb, a bucket of soapy water, and your flea spray. When possible, comb your pet with the flea comb outside so that eggs and larvae don’t fall off inside.


Spray a small patch of fur near the head and ears with the flea spray. Use the flea comb to comb through that section of fur, working in the spray and picking up fleas as you go.
Swirl the comb around in the soapy water any time you pull off fleas in the comb.Work your way from the head to the tail, spraying and combing in small sections as you go.
When you get to the tail, repeat the spraying and combing.
Hose down the area when you're finished to kill any fleas that jumped away. If you combed inside, vacuum the area thoroughly.
Repeat these steps daily until there are no fleas left.

, The ingredient in citrus that repels insects is also toxic to many animals, including dogs and cats. After you comb the flea spray through your pet’s fur every day, shampoo and rinse your pet to wash away excess lemon spray.


Limonene can cause liver damage in animals, but it’s only found in the rind of citrus fruits. Lemon juice itself isn't toxic to your pet, but it’s best to err on the side of caution with the flea spray., When your pets get fleas, it’s important to treat them and everything they come into contact with. This includes their beds, blankets, bedding, rugs, or any other fabric where your pet spends time.


Spray all the bedding with the lemon flea spray and hang it to dry.
Run all the bedding through a hot cycle in the washing machine, followed by a hot cycle in the dryer. This will ensure the fleas are gone and all traces of the lemon spray are removed.

, Collect all your pet’s toys, dishes, and bowls. Wash the bowls and dishes in the dishwasher or in the sink with hot, soapy water. Place fabric toys in the washing machine with the bedding, and hand wash all other toys.


Toys such as tennis balls and stuffed animals can be washed in the machine.
Avoid using the lemon flea spray on pet toys, or anything else they might ingest.

Lay the cotton on your workspace and measure to accommodate your pet sack.,
Cut the cotton material using a pair of sharp sewing scissors.,
Lay pre-cut cotton rectangle on top of your fleece material.",How to Make a Small Pet Carrying Sack2," For example, a 7 by 7 sack would require a measurement of 9 by 16.


Consider using a straight edge to obtain perfect lines and measurements. Follow the straight edge with your fabric pencil to create a “pattern.”
Iron the fabric if you see wrinkles or if you cannot get the fabric to lay flat on your workspace.

, Carefully follow the pre-drawn lines and place excess material in a scrap bag. You should have a piece of fabric that resembles a rectangle.

, Use your fabric pencil to trace the edges around the cotton rectangle. Smooth fleece out with your hand if you have wrinkling--don’t iron as ironing will only destroy this fabric.

"
"
Put the two rectangles together (cotton and fleece).,
Stitch along the long right side of the rectangle--only the long side.

,
Open the one-sided stitched bag so that the fleece and cotton fabrics can lay flat on the surface, joined by your stitch line.

,
Fold the cotton fabric in half so the cotton is folded into the cotton.,
Sew the bag, lengthwise on the cotton end.,
Fold the sack downward so the cotton side is facing outward and the fleece side is facing inward.,
Sew the bottom of the sack in order to close the bottom.,
Turn bag inside out (so fleece is facing outward) and smooth out.,
Turn sack right-side out and iron the cotton side one last time if you see wrinkling.",How to Make a Small Pet Carrying Sack3," Make sure the sides line up perfectly.

,,, Do the same with the fleece by folding it in half. Make sure seams match up.

, Do the same (sew) along the lengthwise end of the fleece end.

,


Iron the cotton side (only) of the sack to remove wrinkling or folds.

, Trim the ends with scissors.

, Add another seam along the bottom, approximately ½ inch away from the bottom. Consider re-sewing this seam to reinforce it.

, Place pet inside and go!

Gather the necessary equipment and materials.,
Pre-scan the animal.,
Follow the correct scanning pattern.,
Do a final sweep.,
Prepare the microchip.,
Restrain the animal.,
Swab the animal's skin.,
Lift the scruff.,
Inject the microchip.,
Withdraw the needle.,
Check the chip.",How to Inject a Microchip Into a Pet," To inject a microchip you will need:



A microchip scanner: Microchips are not completely standardized. This means that not all chips respond to the same frequency scanner. You need a scanner that is compatible with the make of microchip about to be implanted. Whereas Europe mainly uses chips that are ""duplex"" compatible, in the US mainly ""AVID"" and ""destron"" devices are used.

A microchip: This should be sealed in sterile packaging. The chips come with an individual, single use implantation syringe. If the packaging is breached do not use the device because sterility may be compromised.

An assistant: In a docile, compliant dog or cat, or an animal under anesthetic, it is perfectly easy to implant a chip single-handedly. However, the needle causes momentary discomfort and many animals flinch. An assistant restraining the patient ensures the procedure is safe and makes implantation quick and easy.

Cotton wool soaked in surgical spirit: To sterilize the skin.

The animal: The animal to be chipped.;
, It may sound obvious, but it is essential to scan the animal about to be chipped. This is to check the pet isn't already microchipped.


If a chip is found this eliminates the need to go through with the procedure. In addition, it should raise questions about why the pet is being presented for a chip when it is likely he already has an owner.
To check for a chip it is necessary to pass the scanner over the animal in a logical search pattern to ensure a chip that has slipped or migrated from its original implant position is not missed.

, Microchips are implanted under the skin, over the midline of the spine, between the shoulder blades. However, not all chips remain in this spot and movements of the animal during normal activities can cause the chip to migrate and change location.


Activate the scanner by pressing and holding down the button. Rest the sensor on the underside of the scanner softly against the animal's fur, or hover 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) above the skin.
Start with the scanner positioned behind the pet's ears and move left to right, right to left, in a sweeping motion over the animal's neck. Progress in this side to side sweeping motion down the neck, over the shoulders, and to the end of the rib cage.

, If no chip is detected, sweep again but this time run the scanner up and down the length of the animal.


Start in front of the left elbow in the brisket area, slide the scanner back along the chest and tummy, then sweep forwards towards the shoulder.
Repeat this pattern until you have surveyed the animal's entire body. Only then can you be certain no chip is present.

, Once satisfied the animal is not already chipped, prepare the microchip. The chip is stored inside a sterile hypodermic needle attached to an implantation device.


The needle should be inside sealed packaging. On the packaging are stickers with a bar-code and a unique registration number.
Pass the scanner over the needle (while it's still in the packaging) to check the chip is firing, and to get the chip's number. Compare the scanned number with that shown on the packaging. The two should match.
Peel the backing from the packaging but leave the implantation device resting in the pack. Place it within reach.

, Small dogs and cats are best held on a table. Large dogs can be restrained on the floor. When dealing with a dog of uncertain temperament it is best to muzzle him, to ensure operator safety.



Cats: Place the cat on a table. Let the cat sit comfortably and have the assistant firmly grasp the cat's scruff so as to prevent the cat from turning and biting.

Small Dogs: Stand the dog on a table. Have the assistant stand on the opposite side to you, and slide one arm under the dog's neck and place the hand over the dog's ear such that the head is held against the assistant's chest or shoulder. Slide the other arm under the dog's belly with the hand resting on the dog's back so as to pull the body against the chest and stop the dog from sitting down.

Large Dogs: With the dog standing on the floor, the assistant stands behind the dog's head and places a hand on either side of the head, to keep the dog facing forwards.

, Although the implantation needle is sterile, there is a small risk of pushing bacteria from the surface of the skin into the subcutaneous tissues when the needle is inserted. To prevent this, it is best to swab the area first with surgical spirits.


To do this, you should first plan where to place the needle. This is usually midline over the backbone, between the shoulder blades.
Soak a cotton ball with surgical spirits and wipe this over the skin until the fur is well dampened down.

, The chip needs to be implanted beneath the skin and to do this without damaging muscle, tendons, or bones, the scruff is raised up.


If you are right handed, use your left hand to grasp a fold of skin two inches in front of where you plan to place the needle.
Holding the skin firmly between forefinger and thumb, lift this fold of skin vertically away from the body, to the fullest extent the skin comfortably allows without pulling.

, With the scruff still elevated, pick up the installation device and place the needle at a right angle to the flat plain of the elevated scruff.


Hold the device so that the length of the syringe is parallel to the spine and the needle is pointing towards the head. Once satisfied with the needle location, use firm pressure to push the needle through the skin right up to the needle hub.
With the needle deeply embedded through the skin, press the plunger of the implantation device to push the microchip out of the needle and into position beneath the skin.

, When the needle is withdrawn from the skin, the needle tract does not contract instantaneously. As a result, there is a slim chance that the microchip slips back out of this tract immediately after implantation.


This is easily avoided by applying pressure across the needle as it is withdrawn. This pressure sticks the edges of the needle tract together and prevents backward migration of the chip.
To do this, once the microchip is implanted, release the scruff. Using the finger and thumb of the left hand, feel through the skin for the rigid needle.
Press gently but firmly across the width of the needle as the right hand withdraws it. Keep pressing for 10 seconds or longer, after the needle is out. Then release.

, The final step is to check that the chip is in place and working. Activate the scanner and hold it over the area of implantation. If all has gone well, the chip should register strongly on the scanner.


Occasionally the chip does not respond, but because you know the chip worked in the packaging, it is unlikely that the chip is at fault.
The more likely explanation is that the chip failed to exit the needle (scan the needle) or has fallen out on the floor. If this is the case, you will need to repeat the procedure with a fresh chip.
